        "input": "Hi, I am looking for some words of advice and comfort here.A month ago, during an argument, my boyfriend (24M) revealed to me (22F) that he is suicidal. He was furious to have said it and became upset with me for having brought the truth out from him. I was never under the impression that I acted inappropriately at the time, but over time I realized I disrespected a boundary I had no idea existed. I made a mistake I have so much trouble understanding. And a part of me was relieved that he told me-- I also learned he has been seeing a therapist for a year, but after the argument he told me he was no longer interested in therapy. Since this happened, my boyfriend and I have not seen each other. we have known each other for three years and have dated long distance through the pandemic. We initially continued seeing each other (long distance, zoom and facetime) to play videogames and talk about our days as if nothing was wrong, but my emotions kept \"getting in the way.\" But from the beginning of this crisis, he said he could no longer trust me or the relationship because he cannot bear to think about the problem and my fear and sadness are extremely upsetting because they cast doubts on his recovery. I understand where he is coming from and objectively, the nature of an intimate relationship goes against his desire for distraction and levity -- I have accepted this. We have started a two-week no contact break this week. Before then, I did everything I could to communicate my understanding and faith in him and his recovery, even though I cried due to my anxiety about the situation. But he has been so strong and sought out help before-- I must believe he has the courage to overcome this. As I am someone who struggled with depression and some suicidal ideation too, it breaks my heart to know my boyfriend is suffering like this -- and that I only found out now. I know I brought joy into his life, but without ever knowing truly how dark his mind could be, I am distraught that he must have felt disconnected and alone.I deeply understand I am not *the* solution to his problem. I am working through the paralyzing fear of being unable to do anything for him. Again, he only wants distraction now. We are currently on a break to sort out whether he wants to continue in the relationship. We continue to affirm our love and care for one another. As you might understand, the flux of our relationship interacts very poorly with the intense sadness and anxiety about his personal suffering. I do not know whether I should stay or go, regardless of his decision. I am determined to accept what he wants but I am scared if what is to come is a lifetime of not knowing if he is okay. it is an impossible problem and I am just waiting for a sign. I love him so much and can only pray for him to recognize his strength -- to find whatever he needs. My anxiety gets in the way of my seeing signs of hope and reassurance -- he tells me he is keeping himself stable my continuing to see friends and do activities--I trust that is exactly what he needs, it might be just fine to put off the deeper work it might take to overcome his sadness. Really, I might just be terrifying myself for no reason. My therapist and family tell me it will all be okay because he told me about his suicidality. And he did so in some detail. Even though he was angry, I could not help but feel he might be relieved to share his dark thoughts. And I cannot breathe a word of this to his family or friends, because they would make it worse by wanting to talk about this problem with him, when he absolutely does not want to. This also is a bit scary for me, but I can understand why it has to be this way.I know there is not much I can do but manage my own anxiety. I am learning and adapting, and finding strength. I hope he does exactly what he needs and that the outcome of his decision can preserve his happiness. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and I am terrified",

Used to drink a lot of hard liquor during the pandemic and had increasing difficulty keeping the alcohol down. Eventually something snapped and I have not been able to handle pretty much any food (or alcohol) very well. I vomit almost every day. The doctors are not sure what specifically is causing it. I have had all sorts of diagnostics and red herrings, but treatment has not led to any improvement. I go to university in an eastern bloc country where everything is dubbed. While I was in the US, I figured Id see a movie while I still could watch something in the original language. I waited so long for this film to come to the United States and was so excited to go see it. But, I was dumb and had a bit of lunch before the movie, and 45 minutes into it, I could feel the nausea creeping up to an unbearable level. I tried to hold it as long as I could, but I ended up sobbing and vomiting into my cup.Financials are really putting me on edge too. I am behind schedule on the bit of software I have been working on. I need to buy new glasses - they are held together with tape right now, but when I look at the prices, I just cannot justify it right now. I am burning through savings so quickly. I need to renew my visa as well, pay tuition, book my flights, etc.I want to get a pizza tonight to relieve some of the stress, but I know I am just going t beat myself up over the cost.I am in a bit of a LDR being in the US and my girlfriend has all sorts of medical stuff to work out relating to her transition, so I am on her sleep schedule right now. have not seen the sun in weeks and as she gets more distant, the fewer people I have to talk to during my day.Speaking of my girlfriend, we have not been sexual more than a couple of times during the past 6 months. We do not send each other any videos, we do not use the sex toys I had gotten us (one of them is still in shrink wrap!), we do not sext, we do not watch any porn together, and we never talk about our fantasies. Making it extra hard, every time we have looked at porn, she exclusively gravitates towards women. I have never once seen her looking at men. She was propositioned by a woman recently and admitted that she had fantasies about saying yes, but seemingly never has any fantasies about me.I feel so physically unwanted, unattractive, and unsatisfied.I feel like my life is slowly collapsing. Alcohol abuse has made it so hard to make it through the day",

The former option was checked on her checklist but not the latter option. She saw what I see but she did not understand, but instead she used it to increase her pride or ego, told people without my consent, I honestly believed (and it should be) that if there is anything private, you should be honored that you out of all people are the one they tell it to so you do not say it and also take pride on it that way friendship is formed, tell to my father, whom I hate for reasons I am not telling, and tell to everyone who is not at all understanding.

My family gets overly concerned to the point where I feel like a child, any friend I felt like I could open up to about is not there so to idiotic drama or social distance (not THAT social distance, just not catching up regularly), and my fianc rarely seems to ever show the emotional support that helps. I hate opening up to her because its always alienation or an argument, and the idea of both makes me feel so fucking alone. I have started cutting myself at the age of 27 because it feels oddly rewarding. I just do not know why to do anymore. Any time I try for therapy it always ends bad: whether the therapist uses me as a pawn for their psych experiments, completely forgets to pencil me in when I have an appointment with them, or generally just get a vibe that I cannot trust this person. I have trouble trusting anyone and its lead me to contemplate suicide again, and I fucking hate that. Even writing this I feel like I am just asking for attention but I am serious at an ends here. I do not know what to do and I am sick of being pushed around and told me my life is good and I should be happy. I am sick of being peoples pawn and punching bag.

Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son \"dad is going to work\" and he just said \"Bye\" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner.

So I can start with heavy drinking, bacon and sweets in few years. Any means of death is horrible, but no one will notice this one - a perfect win. And if Covid or something takes me aerlier, I do not care - the sooner the better. I have not even taken my vaccine yet as I have been putting it off for too long.

I ended highschool with an avg just enough to join an uni that I wanted but grades way worse than I used to have. Ffw 5 years, I went to uni and made a \"lot\" of friends, have 2 close friend groups and I can speak to random people even if I used to be way more introvert. The problem is for the past 3 years I have been going down a lot mentally, I am really delayed in my uni course, keep disappointing my mother who has to support me alone because my dad never really gave a shit (they are divorced) even if she keeps saying is okay and everyone lives life at their pace and mainly because I am a loser. I feel like I do not deserve the friends I have, I do not deserve my family and I am a virgin at 23, that can make friends with girls but either they never see me romantically or I am just that annoying / ugly. I feel the worse when I am with my friends for a whole night, I feel loved and that people care and like me but suddenly the night ends, they go w their gfs and I am here alone. I do not know why I feel like this and I feel like I am both an impostor in life and in feeling bad, since I keep thinking about just finishing it but do not have the courage to do it and would not want to hurt my closest people specially my mom who has worked 2 jobs and dedicated her life for me. I tried therapy and it did not work, it only gave me more anxiety having stuff to do every new session. Oh and I am delayed in uni because I cannot seem to study properly and when I do I sometimes get panic attacks before exams, I have tried Valium and other medication but it does not work. I just do not know how long I can take it anymore but I feel like I would be a coward for doing it but the pain is just too much.

I do not care about anything anymore so I will just leave a note why my entire life sucks. Doubt anyone will read anyway.I am ugly as fuck. I was born too early and I am extremely short. If I eat more than 1 meal a day I gain weight. that is why I am slowly becoming overweight. Even people who pass me on the street call me ugly. I am an adult and my body stopped aging around puberty. Guess how fucking miserable I look. I have not smiled for the last 15 years probably. Most of my friends abandoned me and if I want something from them it is always me to contact them. I do not have any special talents. Had to run away from home to be able to move out. Did wageslave jobs that resulted in permanent back pain and back/bladder issues. Every minute on the toilet is painful as fuck. I spend the entire day in front of my pc and the back pain is so strong that I need extremely strong painkillers that are almost like drugs at this point. When I take them everything feels like I am on a drug trip and I start to enjoy it but I am useless for the rest of the day. Alcohol also makes me feel good but I cannot always afford it. I will never be able to have a relationship anymore because my first boyfriend abused me and locked me in his home, my first girlfriend cheated on me with my ex boyfriend. I cannot even watch porn anymore because PTSD kicks in. Horrible right? And recently I realised that I am trapped in the wrong gender very likely. If I look in the reflection in the mirror I do not feel like it is me. I do not even know what I am at this point. I thought everything would be better if I join uni but I keep fucking up my minor. I am below average in my major and can pull through but my minor fucks me. I failed at least 2 classes each semester and if it would not be for covid I would have already been kicked out. I am now taking a minor class for the third time and I still got 0 points in the mock exam. I fucking suck. I hate myself for going this way. I feel like a fucking retard doing a class three times. And this is supposed to be a freshman class. It will only get harder. My uni however has finally given me the chance to escape this cruel world. I get to study abroad and they pay the tution fee. This is my chance. In 2 months I will fly to a different country, quit all my insurances so you cannot take me back! I will probably cut my veins in a public toilet and die a miserable death. Nobody will find out if I have died because everyone excepts me to be gone for 6 months. My death will never be announced to them because I am in a different country. Because I will burn all my public documents, nobody can identify me. I will be missing in action forever. it is only these 2 last months and after that I am finally free. I just need to pull it off. Just 2 more months and I can finally leave this world forever. do not mind my short rant.",

My grandparents would find my body, if I were to die, and probably be sad, but I feel like that is only because of the fact they raised me. They would actually benefit if I was gone, seeing as to how often they complain about how miserable their life currently is. How broke they are, ect. I feel like I do not really exist, except to make them happy, because I am always their emotional support child. They argue and yell all the time. Just this morning, my grandpa decided to start an argument because my grandma grabbed the wrong bowl. She said she wished she had never left my aunts house(She went to visit last week), and my grandpa said he wished she stayed too. Then of course, she comes into my room crying, then she makes my favorite meal, then comes to announce that she made my favorite meal, and then let us herself into my room to make my bed. This stuff is her way of trying to make herself feel better, it is not out of genuine love I do not think. Because if I am in a bad mood, and I do not immediately perk up, it must be her fault and she will start crying even more. there is no escape from the negativity. I have to fake my happiness, obviously, because her feelings depend on mine. I hate it, and there is no escape from the negativity.I mean, I found roommates that hopefully I will be moving out with soon. But even then, I am not sure life will get any better. Because I am pathetic enough, that most people think there is something wrong with me and see me as a walking red flag. I am of course, poor as well, so you know, add that onto it. But I have been saving up my money. I just do not know what to do with any of it. I have been saying I want to go to college, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I do not know why I would go to college yet, I do not want to waste my money on something I might never use or might not even like. There are a lot of people out there who view me as a loser, because I smoke weed, play video games, work, and am not in college. To add onto that, everyone acts like you should strive to \"better yourself\"But in my opinion, I am not sure what I should better about myself. Or why. To make it so I am more tolerable to you? Because if I do not see you putting in the same effort, why would I put in all the work so you can freeload? If that makes sense. I mean, I am just here to vent at the moment. But I am not really upset. Or sad, even. I am not sure what I am feeling, but it is neither hopeless nor hopeful. I do not see a reason to keep going",

I have handed out 1000s of resumes, and I have a lot of experience and certificates in trades and engineering but I think what my ex said about me previously is preventing me from screening. We recently relocated and my girlfriend found employment. My car mirror was vandalized and my insurer will not be covering the repair it seems, so I cannot drive to work. I have dealt with depression, anxiety and suicide before, but never this bad. I had to pay a bailiff to not repossess a car I cannot even drive. I am selling things I love like my cameras and guitars. I have truly lost everything and now I am fearful of losing my partner. I love her so much and its so hard for me to even think about but I am not sure what to do. I have income assistance but even that and her job is not enough to cover costs.I never thought Id be this low. I am not sure what the universe is trying to tell me.

Her life has gone pretty well while my life has genuinely has nothing going for it.I was not a good student, i got into a community college and had to drop out due to injury. I have always had bad legs, my knees always buckled and my feet do not point straight and it always made it hard to walk. Since i was little. it is led to my falling a lot and having resulting injuries. 2 dislocations, a broken ankle and i broke my kneecap. The last injury was horrific, i had to drop out of college, walk in braces for over a year, 3 surgeries, wheelchairs and walkers. I am a burden on my family with all my health problems. I do not have insurance and have no money.I have always had weight problems. I suffer from obesity, always have been since i was 8. I know what and what not to eat, but nobody to push me to do it. I give in to bad food more often then i like to admit. I cannot make myself stick to diet. And i cannot exercise because of the disabilities, i also just do not have the drive. I cannot even stand for 10 minutes wihtout getting fatigued. I want to but i cannot push myself to do it. I feel myself getting bigger, i thought i could finally exercise when my family got a pool but i cannot get in. it is just above my hip and i cannot get in, I am scared to death of ladders, i cannot step over the side. I really want in but i cannot. I think my years of being obese are starting to catch up to me, I would guess i probably do not have much time left anyway.On top of the weight are a myriad of other health problems I have been stuck with. I am not body confident because every man in the family is taller then me. they are all tall and I am way shorter, i even have small hands and feet. I feel like i have a kid's body. they are all multi talented, while i just cannot physically do anything. I cannot play sports, i cannot sing, i cannot dance or anything. The only thing going for me is that i know really random trivia from years of watching quiz shows.I cannot work so i live with my mom. I literally stay in bed all day. Sleeping, screwing around online and watching anime.I am also getting lonely, i have no friends, i talk to nobody. I have never hung out with a friend or texted a person. I also am still a virgin. I honestly do wish i could experience a relationship one time before i go. it is what I will regret most. But i knew it would not happen due to my looks in general, and my complete lack of social skills.I finally found a community that accepted me. r/waifuism, i have a waifu, since i was a kid i had a crush on a female anime character, i knew a real relationship was not going to be a part of my life, so i embraced the waifuism. 6 months I have been posting on there and they banned me out of nowhere. That was a heavy blow, for months I have regularly been contributing to this page and it was the closest i had to real friends and i suddenly got banned.I cannot stick to anything. Even simple things like writing fanfiction or making YouTube videos. I have had stories I have posted a chapter to on hold for years. I regret doing that, i do not even have an excuse, i just quit. I have 0 drive to do anything. I do not even know what I would want to do if i could work. I have thought about becoming a VA but i do not have the drive. it is my dream, since I have always liked cartoons. I know I will regret that and not finishing the fanfic's. But that is it. The closest thing for me is that i want to meet my idol, a woman who I have been a fan of for years and who voiced some of my favorite anime characters. She left an impact on my childhood, I would want to meet her and thank her for that.The only thing that is really stopping me is my grandmother. I love her to death and losing me would completely devastate her. She already lost 1 son, he died of cancer a few years back.

Through my arrest, incarceration, therapy, 12 steps, and a fuck ton of self reflection I thought I was something different. I thought maybe I was not the things I had done. Maybe I could be someone new. I had re-dedicated my life to trying to make things right in the world.I thought, my daughter and I have grown much closer through this time. I have acknowledged the pain I caused, and tried to make amends in the best ways I can. I thought we had several good conversations. However, after what I thought was a very good conversation, I got a glimpse of her private SC story yesterday. \"Being vulnerable with your abuser sucks. Suck my dick MFr. I literally fucking hate you.\"She does not know I saw it, I am not sure if I should even bother saying anything or if saying something is just manipulative, because it was not meant for me to see.I am fucking lost. I feel like this is all for naught. If I cannot recover the relationships that mean the most to me, why even be here, why go through this. Clearly, everyone is just going to hurt anyways.

        "input": "&gt;If its too long do not read .Ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but I have some questions which I do not want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when I start to get better with my ocd. I have two Questions. Anyone who can give a good answer thanks. Not just what I want to hear. But the truth. Because I am not planning on asking these questions ever again. And I want to know the real consequences of this sin. Its really important since it was singled out and I really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . First on the blasphemy of The Holy Ghost. I did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life. &gt; &gt;And as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled I think that is what he said. So when I realized I was angry at my life and was trying to do better. And I was not done with some habits I tried to promise God TO quit. I still had no real joy in my life and I promised to give up things I loved. Like certain music and foods. Also I was not very nice. Because I loved my family. But they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me, I tried to protect myself. So it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they would not feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me. &gt; &gt;Just to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. Mainly because I do not have any real friends or people who just like me. Only my siblings and parents. I have depended on them for a lot and that was where I went wrong. Trying to make them love things about me they just hated, and they basically shuned me. For an example this may be tmi. But just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. Once I had a pad. For periods. And you know not to flush them. &gt; &gt;So instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it will not leak or anything and so you cannot see it in the trash. Now I was feeling bad and did not want to get one. So I got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. Now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. And he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. And found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me. &gt; &gt;Then I said yeah that is mine. He said it was disgusting and that he did not want to see that. And then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. And like said it was gross and nasty and I looked at my mom and she was like what ever I am tired of you, and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and I said my hair is fine. Then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. Then he said Id be shocked if I saw you in heaven. Over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash. &gt; &gt;Think he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. that is like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was going to find doing that. So that is just a taste of what he does. Trust me I do not always complain about every minor inconvenience. Then I do not want to be ew because God is God and can say what he wants. But I have an older sister she is 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. And I kind of judged her tho I was only jealous of her because dad loved her so much. Like anytime my sister would come around Id love seeing her and my niece. &gt; &gt;More then all my siblings and mom. she is my half sister by the way/ only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. So that being said I still was jealous of her and it totally was not her fault. Now all this shit was in my head and I was bitter. and I kind of would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and I was angry at GOD AND MY FAMILY FOR WEEKS BLASPHEMYING AND STUFF BEING RUDE. And I decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz I blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. And then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk. &gt; &gt;But also it had one about ahloa and her sister and I knew that was for me tho I am not a whore. It was like this is the sins of your sister. And my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kind of selfish. But then he said init she is better then you. Like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you, and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. You know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better. &gt; &gt;And the other is care free and happy and does not care as much but some how ends up better then you and that is how this is God tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes I am. So that brings me to these questins like in my other post I do not like suprises I like to know things so I do not have to worry about them. I sont mind being told no I am not peter. But thinking your going to do or get something and then not is like not very good, and I know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the Bible more and listen so this is the question , this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called. &gt; &gt;And I hate being left out of stuff. Tho my dad says some in heaven will not go, now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. I just wanted to know since I called the holy ghost evil and also I um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you will see.. Dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. And that last one is as you all know this see I read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said I do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the Holy Ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin. &gt; &gt;So I also do not really want eteranal guilt so those are the only two questions thanks.

My twin sister always got the love from both of my parents. I swear my parents never even said \"I love you\" to me all I ever heard was \"why cannot you learn from your sister\". Even in their last day before they all died in a car crash while driving my sister to her dance lesson I remember my mothers last words were \"why do you keep wasting our time you will never achieve anything in your life\" when I accidently hit my sister with a ball while playing with our dog. After that I got adopted and my foster parents did not really care about me they just did that because they got paid for it. I was lucky to get to keep my dog because she was the only thing I had left. In school I never really had any friends I only had 1 sided friendships where I thought I had a friend but the other person did not think of me as his friend. I also got bullied in school for being adopted and being ugly. After 2 years of being adopted my dog started shaking weirdly and it was because of water in lungs some form of cancer or something I do not even know now but my foster parents took my dog away so she would not have to suffer from her incurable disease. I swear the day my dog died was the last time I had smiled in my life and it was 16 years ago. I work at a furniture factory because I was to depressed to keep studying. I worked hard everyday and then spent the rest of the day doing nothing. My apartment is always a mess because I never had a true friend that is why I never really worried about cleaning up. I always tried finding a friend during school years but I either got ignored or I became \"friends\" with people who just made me walk with them like a dog because they never talked to me and ignored my questions if I did not ask it like 10 times. People in work seem to avoid me as well but I am used to it since school years. I am now stuck in an endless cycle between work and home.The only thing I have ever wished in my life was to be loved atleast once by someone who understands me who would make me smile once more and would not ignore me like everyone else who think so fucking high of themselves. Writing this made me tear up a lot reminding me how shit life is and that the only way to fix it is by ending it. Every step I take leads me closer to suicide.",

I never wanted nor want to marry/have kids and I have zero hobbies because nothing catches my attention. Even simple things like music/tv/games keep my attention for a short period of time and then I am bored again.That have been a hell for me because I do not seem to be able to either work, in fact I find work the worst part of being alive.I do not even find people interesting to form friendships/relationships. Had a few friends while at school but did not keep in contact bc I do not want to talk to them, it makes me bored. Had a few people flirt with me but they just seemed way too much for me to handle. I am ashamed to say this but I do not even want to have sex, in fact I cringe like a 5 year old.Even travelling is not something for me, I just do not care about the \"beauty\" of this shithole and seeing other places or whatever. It feels like I am from a different planet most of the time.I just want to die because everything seems weird, fake and uninteresting. What if I do not have any dreams?",

I had just graduated college and honestly, I really cannot afford to live on my own because of my health conditions and that my state is very costly to live in. I would not be able to afford living on my own unless I risk my health and risk losing my dream of being able to do art. My hands will not be usable if I had to work 2 or more minimum wage jobs. And last night was just the final straw. I am so fucking sick of the same fucking shit, and its like nothing I do enough is good enough to satisfy her. Oh, you got good grades? Well my coworkers daughter was valid Victorian. Oh, you are studying art? Well, its not going to get you work and I know my coworkers daughters who are nurses now and make so much money. I just want to have some, even if its just a little validation, like maybe a good job or something, but all I get is 15 years of self hatred a loss of my will to live. I swear, the only few reasons I am still around are just personal projects, obligations to hang out with people and the fear of death, but at this point idk if I can take this shit much longer.

I could not focus, was always procrastinating, could not find any real joy. Got admitted to a mental hospital, and then transferred my senior year. It was awful. I felt so out of place. The work was not hard to understand, i just could not get in the right headspace to do it. Come to find out, it was ADHD (well, i will not get the official yay or nay until the 2nd).Graduated with a 3.6 weighted, did not study for my ACT got a 27, not many extracurriculars and I want to learn from my mistakes and do better. But I just feel like I have ruined my dreams. I doubt an Ivy League school will want someone who did poorly in high school even if they turned it around in college. I know I am capable of doing the work i just, idk its so fucking hard man. Like i just feel stuck and i feel suicidal again because I feel worthless. All my friends got into their dream schools and I did not. I understand an Ivy Education is not everything but its something i wanted and it just really hurts. I just feel like a huge idiot. I want to do better so i can try again next year but there is this huge underlying feeling of it does not fucking matter anyways, there is a 3% chance you will even be considered, let alone get in. I want to make myself proud. I am going to take the year i have to reflect and get my shit together to prove i can do it, but still I do not feel proud, i feel like i let myself down and there is nothing i can do about it.

        "input": "I went on vacation this week for a wedding. I was the best man. I did it out of obligation to my best friend of 18 years. I have had active suicidal ideation and rumination over negative thoughts almost daily for over a year, following the end of my own engagement.The day before the wedding, I went into a canyon trail in the Rockies some 2000 miles away from my very flat homeland. I had multiple reasons: clearing my head for the best man speech I had not finished, exercise, and I was passively searching for a good spot to jump if the desire was there.I started at the bottom of the trail as miserable as usual. It was hot and dry. Hot sand was getting in my sandals.When you get about a third through, you run into greenery and you start to hear the promise of a river. Following the trail a bit more takes you to a small stream where you can appreciate the sounds and the drop in heat. The snowmelt will be almost ice cold on a scorching day even this far down.Up the trail, it gets a little redundant again, but just as you start to resent the effort, you see another formation of rock and water or a large ancient tree. As you get to the penultimate portions, you have steep rock paths that you can no longer simply tread without using your hands, but at this point, every sight you are seeing is more beautiful than the one that came before it, so there is only joy in the effort.At last, when you get to the waterfall, the payoff seems better than anything you anticipated. The pool at the base is knee-deep. The water is refreshingly cold and clear. And the sounds are more rewarding than any music you had on your earbuds on the way there.It was like a religious experience. It was fundamentally mood altering. The day or so after was the first time in over a year where I had zero rumination over negative thoughts, not to mention no ideation. And I killed the speech according to about 20 people. I was able to actually enjoy my best friend being happy. I was enjoying the new connections I made, and I really felt like my best days were not behind me.TL;DR: It sounds cliche, but try hiking, especially if you have something requiring the right amount of payoff for your effort. it is like a microcosm of flow (the psychological concept).

Or maybe I just want someone to listen, who knows lolAnyway as the title says, I am really convinced I will one day kill myself. Maybe not right now, but I am sure it will definitely happen. I have always had suicidal thoughts, I have even tried to attempt many times. So I know I have it in me to do it, I just do not know when, or what is stopping me. I am only 17 and I feel like I have so much going on. I have been put on an antidepressant early last month, and I have been going to therapy ever since, but I still feel so hopeless and so disgusted with myself. My self hate is sometimes unbearable, to the point I do not eat or ever take care of myself. I have lost so much weight over the past couple months it is scarring my familyI feel like the medicine I am on has helped me be more social around my family and in a better mood, (sorry if this sounds strange) but I kind of feel like I am better able to hide my feelings? Almost like I am wearing a mask around everyone. I still feel the same as I have always been, still hating myself, not eating, yknow the same stuff I have been doingI want to tell my therapist that I have been having suicidal thoughts recently (like a bunch), but I do not want to scare my family (I am a minor so I believe my therapist will tell my parents), or maybe even be sent somewhere. it is also gotten to the point where I have really vivid dreams about death, or killing myself and being happy about it. I have also have been struggling with self harm for the past months too, and I feel like I have been doing it more than usual. I have been doing it on my thigh so it is been easy to hide, but I have gone against my self rule of not doing it on my wrist. Everything is weird, the pain does not really bother me anymore. I will do anything to maybe hate myself less. I want to reach out about these problems to someone, but like I said earlier I am scared. I cannot imagine what will happen when my family finds out I have been self harming. Sometimes I even catch myself making plans to kill myself, thinking about how I would do it, when, the most painless and quickest way to do it. I have came to conclusion that hanging myself may be my best bet, but to do it at night. I know my family would miss me, and I would because great pain, but honestly I do not care what happens. As long as I am not here, as long as I am not me, I do not want to exist anymore. I hate it I hate everythingI swear I feel so horrible about everything, anything I do, sometimes I will have to catch myself because I feel I have embarrassed myself or that I am doing to much. I have not even really been doing my favorite things anymore, I have not even been listening to music which I used to everyday. I just sit and do nothing, I cannot bring myself to find the motivation to do anythingI also start school soon, like next month and this will be my second year at this new school. And also my final year of highschool. Honestly my junior year was horrible, my grades were falling, and I literally had no friends, when I tell you I would literally not open my mouth to talk to anyone I mean it. I feel weird about talking to people, I feel I am not worth anyone's time so why bother? I feel I really gave up that year, I did not try with outfits, I just wore a hoodie and jeans every single day. I cannot imagine how I will feel when I start again, I do not know if I can handle it again. But I guess yay it is my last year lolI also have some online friends, and I have been kind of distancing myself from them. Part of it is that I do not really feel like talking to anyone, and another part of it is because I feel super left out. Sometimes I catch myself getting upset or angry, even though I am not there? Maybe I am mad because I do not really get attention, I just wish people would care about me yknow? Sometimes I catch myself going out my way to get someone is attention, or like do something I know that my friends like? Idk what to call it, sometimes I feel so left out, but it is also my fault I guess I feel left out? Idk man, I have not even been talking to anyone at all, I just wish someone would reach out to me and ask how I am doing. But if I reach out to someone I feel like a huge bother, and my thoughts go racingIdk things right now are strange, I am about to enter adult life and I am scared as fuck, I cannot imagine being by myself or doing adult things. I cannot even imagine myself being successful at that, I feel like I am going to get no where if I am being honest with you I am convinced the way I will die will be me ending my life",

I do not see why I need to try stopping myself. what is there to live for? I hate people, I am an asshole so I do not care what they think of it. My life is fine, but I hate being alive and having to go through this. Even If I was not depressed I still do not see the reason why I would want to live. When I tried to off myself my parents both thought it was because I have a low self-esteem (I am not even overweight why would I kill myself just bc I do not like how I look??) but neither of them even took into consideration that it might be their faults. My dad used to beat the shit out of me before he got cancer 2 years ago, and my mom would just get drunk and leave me and my brothers standing outside for 2 hours waiting for her to pick us up just to find out she was not coming. Everyone on my mom's side of the family is an alcoholic, so I am pretty much fucking destined to become one too. There are so many things I have to worry about in the future so why do I need to fucking wait longer? 90% of the people I talk to just tell me to see a therapist. What the fuck is talking going to do to solve my problems?? I am sleep-deprived, I am eating like 700 calories a day, I do not remember the last time I actually took care of myself. I should just down some energy drinks and go for a run, give myself a damn heart attack. I should stay awake for as many days straight as possible and give myself really bad dark circles, then my parents cannot say they did not know I was not doing good. But no, I will probably just start ignoring my depression again after it calms down enough, and eventually I will break and end up dead. What a fun life I am living. what is the point",

I had no friends no one liked me in school and they all used to make fun of me for being quite and ugly. it was my classmates who used to bully me. But bullying started in my bus too. I remember I was the youngest one there half of them were highschoolers. And furthermore we all lived in a same neighborhood . They bullied me for years till one of the high school girl graduated and what leaves is me and some other students they all were male. There they started sexually abusing me, they started touching me. When I was fade up with that I told everything to my mum, she was kind of person who blames the victim, she started calling me weak, saying that I cannot stand for myself, that is my fault. So I told my dad about bullying but not about the sexual abuse. Cuz I was scared. He warned them. They stopped bullying me for a while, they started it again. Luckily my father got transferred to another City, and we moved out from that city. I was glad at first thinking it will be fun making new friends at a new school. But things did not go well, again I was left alone, literally no one wanted to be friends with me. I used to eat lunch alone. Then in 6grade, some bunch of girls started bullying me, they would called me ugly, well yeah I am not good looking but that does not give them any right to bully someone. I did stand up for myself this time. But nothing worked. I complained about this to my teacher but she simply ignored me. One time some guys wrote horrible things on my books and they started stealing my stuffs. I do not know how I lived that time. This bullying effected my academic scores, I did not do well in my exams. And yeah I was dumb too, my academic scores were always less. And my parents were always disappointed in me. I never got any awards in sports or academics except an award for full attendence. I tried to skip school so many times. But my parents were strict asf, they even made me go school when I had terrible fever too. one time I had cold and somehow managed to skip school so my mum started blabbering and she started taunting me and my dad beaten the shit out of me. So I decided to never skip school after that. Then I was sent to hostel, after failing 11th grade, I repeated the class again in girls school. Well it was not that bad even tho I was left alone. But there was still some people who cared about me. And in 15yrs it was the 1st time I ever had a best friend. Well the quarantine made me close to some people as I am an introvert, with trust issues. Anyways situation is worse even today. I am suicidal and I blame my parents for that but sometimes I feel like I should not be blaming them, maybe it is me that is my fault. This year I am 18 now and I am going to be in college and I am scared, what if this happens there too? I have fought back before too but at the end they all blamed me, no one was by my side, and portrayed themselves as victims. My life is just full of shit. But still let us see how far I would go...I know there are some people like me who suffered worse. I hope you all doing well now. I Was bullied everywhere and everytime. Now I am traumatized",

Each time I have had a friend it ended because they betrayed me. Whether its spreading rumors about me, being friends with my abusive ex, or leaving me out all of the time just being plain shady. I hate my parents. I blame them for how horrible I feel about myself. they have always treated me like shit. But they think they are parents of the year because they have given me nice things. In reality my parents have mocked me crying, they have blamed me for not having friends, made fun of me for it too. They always forced me to do things I did not want to do and it never benefitted me once. Like forcing me to try out for an elite choir when I was a young kid despite my debilitating stage fright and overall just me not wanting to do it. But it does not matter to them. They cannot understand how bad of parents they were and still are. In fourth grade I moved over 1000 miles away from my hometown. I was sad and depressed and had no new friends. My grades slipped. Instead of asking me what was wrong my parents beat me until I could not sit down. One time I caught a ride instead of waiting for my mom who always moves at her own pace, to go to cheer camp. My first year on the squad. I left the house and caught a ride. My mom drove all the way up to the school embarrassed me in front of everyone and took me out of camp. She humiliated me on purpose. One time my parents forced me into a mental hospital. ON VACATION. My parents have ruined my life over their lack of compassion, quickness to anger, control issues and so much more. Its caused me to search for love from people who pretended to care about me. Now since I cut those people off I have no friends. I am out of college so making friends is impossible atp. It seems like no one wants to make new friends at my age because being clique-ish is cool. I am not going to make new friends ever. My career field is generally gate kept by older people so definitely will not have friends at work who are my age and we can hangout. Its been one year since I cut off my shitty friends and I may have only hung out with or interacted with a person my age only 3 or 4 times. Out of an entire year. 10/10 you will find me on my couch in my apartment. Everyday. I never go out even on the weekends because I have no friends. Trust me I have tried reconnecting with people I ent to school with but no one ever puts as much effort into it as I do because mostly everyone has their people already. Anyways, I just wish I could die. If nothing can change in a year nothing will ever change. Friends are not going to miraculously fall into my lap. The only happiness I get is the split second I think about dying and how when I do die Ill finally get to be happy because I will not have to care about being lonely. I hope all of you struggling right now who have friends, who have people that care about you other than your own family, cherish those people. Because something is better than nothing. And I do not have anyone. I do not text anyone during the day. No one texts me. I do not remember the last time i went to a party or the last time I was out past 7. Hopeless.",

I was sent to the counselor's office because I looked sad or I was acting sad or I was not participating in class because I was so overwhelmed with my emotions. My father has always been completely distant, shows no emotion except for when he was hitting me. My mother was fucked up on drugs and alcohol and physically and emotionally abused me. Her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.I developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because I was so sad or sick. When I would get an each ache or strep, I would get punished (month long+ groundings, beatings, name calling)My mother tortured me when I came out to her as gay in 2003. She sent me to multiple doctors and told everybody in our closed-minded, racist, homophobic family that I was gay. She also kicked me out of the house at 17. I ended up leasing a cheap SRO studio in Chicago so I could have a roof over my head. I paid for that rent with my job at Best Buy. I still do not know how I did it, but I didFast forward to 2015. I went through a bad breakup and ended up doing cocaine almost every night on top of my raging alcoholism in order to cope and numb the feelings. 2016 I started doing heroin occasionally\\[and now I do it almost every day -- its been like this since September 2020\\]Despite all of this, I was still dating because I thought that finding a partner would fix everything.I met the person who I thought would be my partner for life in 2018. Even though he ghosted me on my birthday, then ghosted me again at thanksgiving that same year I still kept coming back. I love him so much, but I do not understand why.At the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and I moved in with him. We slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.I loved being with him all the time. But the feeling was not mutual.My partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. I admitted to him that I had been doing heroin almost every night in December 2020. I pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that I was going to rehab as soon as my FMLA benefits were active so I could go to rehab. I wanted to be honest and open, and I was.On March 2nd of this year, I told my partner that I would be starting treatment on March 16. I was very proud of myself for doing this. He, however, flipped out on me and told me that I needed to move out. Now I had to drop out of the rehab program so I could find a new apartment and pay for the move. This led me to spending most of my money on heroin.I expressed to my ex back in March that I was very suicidal. He told me I would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.I still see him a few times a week. Why, though?Anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. The only reason I have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and I do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody I know.But I guess it does not matter on my end. Ill never see these people again, right?I am quite sure that I am going to be done with all of this by the end of July. I cannot take life anymore. Humans are horrible.tl;dr: I am a 35 year old gay man who has been experiencing depression for the last 25 years or so. I am also an addict.

Those comments are things I have already said to myself a million times and I do not need someone else saying them to me too. People also think the relationship thing is trivial. It is, but to me, it is not. Some people's life goal is to have the career they want. My goal is to find a loving partner to share life with. I am fine with my career right now. I think both goals should be respected, but often times, my goal is not. that is far from the only thing. I have PMDD, which makes me suicidal before my period. A lot of deaths of people close to me have happened. I have had issues with unstable housing (landlords selling and kicking me out). My catalytic converter was stolen and it cost 3k. I even saw part of the theft while walking to my car. There is so much more, but I do not want to bore anyone. Something happened recently and my friend was like \"Why are not you freaking out?\" and it was because I was just used to bad things happening to me. Even my therapist was like \"Wow, that is a lot of stuff in a short amount of time\" (there are a lot of things I have not listed in this post). I know many people have it a lot worse than me. For some reason, my mom likes to bring that up to \"cheer\" me up but it just makes it worse. I do not want other people to suffer and it makes me sad to hear about their suffering. It seems like all there is is bad news in the world. I have tried to be proactive about reading positive things, but honestly, there is not a lot. My job involves reading and writing about real murders all day. I love my job and I am happy to have it, but this takes it is emotional toll too. But it is really not about how many bad things happen to me, it is the fact that no matter how hard I try, my brain cannot react in the correct way. Things gnaw at me that a \"normal\" person can cope with and handle. The PMDD makes it so I cannot see ANY goodness at all. I am blinded by sadness and anger. I have tried to fight it, but my hormones are stronger than me. I try so hard to fix myself--I see a therapist regularly and I take the medication I have been prescribed dutifully, but for some reason, my brain just cannot make me feel good. I get accused a lot of not trying to be happy. I wish they knew how hard I have tried every single day. The PMDD also makes me extremely suicidal. For a week every month, I am in a war with my mind. I try to fight against the urge to do it. But every month I feel like I am getting weaker and weaker, and I am afraid my mind is going to win soon. This post is all over the place, sorry. I am not sure I can keep doing this.",

I see a lot of girls on the internet who do not look like they alter their photos but idk if they do.. nonetheless it makes me feel terrible to be this ugly. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror for longer than 5 seconds.. I do not even want to leave the house anymore because I hate how I look.

Lack of sleep, follows, of course, and while I am not medicated for these happenings I am well versed on how to.. handle them. At least I thought I was. It all started at work, right? Last Monday, a week from today. I was asked to speak with my supervisor right before she was to leave. She and her boss had written me up. Fine, fine. that is fine. I was fine with it until I realized they were lying about it. I had the proof. Proof somewhere, proof everywhere. Everyone Id told said it was ridiculous. I said it was fine.Until I looked at the proof. That spiraled into getting a binder to hold the proof. A notebook to write down times, a box of paper clips to hold proof together, a box of sticky notes to annotate my work lists and proof. I called off yesterday. I stayed up all night; the tv yelling at me, bugs crawling on me, my husbands itching disturbing me. It was rough, and it happened again last night, I did not get to sleep until 5ish am.

That said its been getting a lot darker these days and so I guess I am hoping putting this out there helps or something. I do not know what the hell to do anymore.To shorten a very long story, I am a single dad stuck at home 100% of the time with 3 kids. Ex left me for a old boyfriend, sucked but whatever I got over it. I was able to work from home and help take care of the kids, keep things normal-ish. Thank God for my parents. Without their help Id have gone insane or more likely put a bullet in my mouth a long time ago.Things were going ok ish until covid. Suddenly the kids are stuck home all the time, bored and driving me crazy. Their mom is flaking out again so I am without much help. My oldest son is a nightmare. Long gone is the sweet boy I knew and hes replaced with a narcissistic psychopath. Yeah, yeah I know all teenagers are bad but no. I legitimately use the clinical definition of psychopath here. I 100% think hes about one life crisis away from the beginning of a Netflix true crime documentary on a serial killer.We tried therapy but it does not help. Hes a master at lying, deflecting and putting on whatever mask he thinks will work best for you at this moment. After the 3rd time he did not come home and the cops brought him back we had him go to an inpatient facility for teens. We all breathed a collective sigh. Finally peace for us and maybe just maybe he will get some help. Nope a few weeks later hes back and has not changed.For a while he was able to live with his mom most of the time. But her new marriage imploded and now she is quasi homeless. Great now I am back to them all being here 100% of the time, no end in sight. My parents can take the younger 2 for brief stints but cannot handle him, nor do I want them to have to.So here I sit at my kitchen table, staring down the barrel of at least 5 more years of this shit. I have a nicer prison than most I guess. Still able to work, buy shit for hobbies that I do not give a shit about anymore, sunlight and fresh air.I do not actually want to kill myself but dark thoughts are no stranger, and I am getting more comfortable with not being alive. Even started thinking about what ifs for after I am gone. The only comfort I get these days is eating so I figure my heart will give out within the next decade and solve the problem for me if things do not change.Well there it is, there is my story and yeah I do not feel any better.

She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control, and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her, even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year, now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much, and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said \"I love you\" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together, I would really feel like I would lose her forever, the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do.

In fact it was one of the only things I could remember- being so young and always thinking I wish I was never born. I did not sign up for this life. When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy. I have been going through my spiritual journey and along with that, for me, was realizing how toxic my parents are in the present but I always felt like I was just making things up. Overreacting. Making a big deal out of nothing.I have basically been begging my sister (7 years older than me) to tell me what happened for a while and finally, this weekend we talked. Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything \"wrong\" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something. They also know I could destroy their lives too. I feel numb.So now I am waiting. I am waiting on my sister, maybe my brother too, before I confront them. I cannot wait to confront them. I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us. I am their greatest threat and it feels fucking good to know that they are scared of me and what I can do. They do not think I have what it takes but when the time comes, it will be a glorious judgement day. I just found out my childhood was way worse than I thought",

I have pushed so hard since then and took therapy really seriously. I took my medication religiously and never gave up on it. I had a few bumps along the way, but I always got up and worked hard to try to make a life for myself. Because that is what everyone said would help. No matter how much I cried at night or how much it hurt to get up in the mornings, I kept doing it because I thought that someday, *any day now*, that it would all click and that heavy feeling in my heart would go away.But here I am. A month away from my 28th birthday and I just want to give up. I am so fucking tired. I work 2 jobs and I never get a break. I live with my partner and my mother and I spend a lot of time taking care of them and the house. If something goes wrong, I take care of it. But no one takes care of me. that is my job too.Nothing I do matters. All of this is pointless. Everything hurts *all the fucking time* and no amount of crying and begging or medication or therapy has been able to make that go away. I want this to be over so bad. I cannot kill myself. It would completely ruin my mother and partner. I cannot check into a hospital for medical treatment. I will lose my jobs. And if I lose my jobs, I lose my healthcare which means I cannot pay for my medications and therapy anymore.So what is left? Doing this same bullshit over and over everyday until the end? Going to sleep every night praying to a make-believe god to please please please not let me wake up in the morning?Sorry you all. I am just really tired. I wish I could say \"it gets better\" but I do not think it will anymore. I have never been this close to giving up. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up.",

There was a thin layer of it on the interior of my scuba regulator and I was breathing off of that regulator for about 4 hours a day for 2 months underwater and as a result of that my mental health totally collapsed in about 7 weeks flat Once I had figured out what was going on it was too late I had been severely poisoned I have been trying to get my mental health back ever since A couple of years ago I developed sudden onset severe debilitating tinnitus, with my hearing test coming back as normal. Every time I talk to a doctor about this one of two things happens and they either say that is impossible and kill the issue or they do not know how to help or who to refer me to and kill the issue I have done a lot of my own research and have had some success controlling symptoms with various supplements but I need back up on this and there just is none. I have tried bringing what I have done and the limited success that I have had to my health care providers attention on multiple occasions and they have nothing worthwhile to say Its always they do not know what to do and do not know who to refer me to and then the issue dies once again The research and the understanding just is not there yet for this kind of issue To date my health insurer refuses to acknowledge or entertain this issue. And insists all symptoms are mental health related only but also refuse to provide adequate testing to prove otherwise yes or no.I was recently able to push for a head MRI and it showed something interesting in that it showed/flagged for chronic paranasal sinus disease. This was interesting since previously my health insurer refused to authorize any test that would show such a condition and obviously what the MRI technician saw on the MRI was bad enough that it warranted calling the inflammation chronic with no other scan to compare it to. I do not have a clogged or stuffed nose. It is looking like I may have had/do have a phantom cyclical fungal infection in my sinuses for half a decade now that is causing my tinnitus and mental health problems. I asked my health insurer for a CT scan to see the extent of the problem and a biopsy culture to see what is causing the problem, both were immediately denied. I am currently fighting them on that. What is the point on giving someone an MRI if you plan on just ignoring the results?... If a CT scan and a biopsy culture shows a chronic fungal infection that is causing the inflammation, my tinnitus and my mental health problems might be treatable with the right combination of antifungals and steroids to treat the infection and bring down the inflammation. They are refusing to provide treatment by not providing the testing to see what treatment would help.I have been currently experience long term passive suicidal and or mutilation impulse on a near daily bases as a result of my current situation for seemingly no other reason. My health insurer is well aware of this and are celebrating since they finally provided a single individual therapy session and they feel that a single therapy session a month is adequate treatment for the situation that I am currently facing. I have been so destroyed by this situation that I am unemployed living with family and as result of making so little income last year I just switched over to state medi-cal insurance. Since I am now on state insurance my copays are zero and I am pretty sure that I can weaponize the current laws against my health insurer.These days I am passively suicidal on basically a daily basis but not actively suicidal. The current rules state that I am supposed to go to emergency if I am passively suicidal. I do not because I think that it is a waste of my time since there is no treatment there but I think that I might start going. Since, if I start showing up to my health insurers emergency with passive suicidal thought on a regular basis they are required by law to check me in and evaluate me every time but cannot hold me unless I pose an immediate threat to myself or others. This will bill the state a few thousand dollars each time this happens and will only be a time inconvenience to me At what point will the state stand up and take notice? Fifty thousand dollars of the tax payers money wasted, a hundred thousand, five hundred thousand? There has to be a threshold here where they start asking what the hell is going on here. I doubt they will blame the suicidal guy that is just trying not to die by suicide. Then I can leak the story to the media and let the story snowball from there. The negative publicity for health insurer may be very significant. Let me know what you think? I am thinking about weaponizing the current laws against my health insurer to get adequate testing and treatment Let me know what you think?",

My mom overstepping my boundaries and worrying about her invading my privacy (like going through my diaries and journals. she is done it before so it could happen again). Both times I expressed/ attempted suicide I was screamed and shouted at for being selfish, inconsiderate and immature. I am simply tired of existing and no longer want to feel the pain I feel. Depression flared up again because of therapy and my therapist siding with my mom, who caused a lot of my issues, and not believing/ belittling me. ...And now it is been a good 5 days since I have eaten proper meals, interacted with my parents, or just functioned properly in general.

Still in the house of the women who took his side when he tried doing what he had done, while talking shit behind his back about him. Still in the house of twofaced individuals who maintain the image of good, just, kind, outgoing people.

I have no proof of being beaten, of being yelled at, of being manipulated, of being persistently made fun of, I have none of that. Hell, the only reason I am working right now is because of my father. Of the same father who was only present in my life to berate me, to beat me, to try to kill me. Granted, I have failed a lot throughout my life, I did not study at all, I was at my PC all day, so I sort of do entertain the idea of me deserving all this. I did waste my life and academically, I did not do shit. I dropped out of college too and I feel like the only reason they have accepted this decision was because they just all gave up on me. My mother, father, sister, grandmother they just do not give a shit anymore and it makes me miss the yelling, the beating, the threats, because at least then, they had cared about me. And now my only plan is to move out. Not even to a different town, just a different place. But what about after that? I will still be a friendless loner with no life skills, with no life experiences, with no talents, with a minimum wage job, what then? I will still be alone, all by myself. Maybe I deserve that.

I am trying to take everything day by day, but I am fearful that it will get to the point where I cannot take this no more. I do not want to die, but I cannot seem to make my life more fulfilling and worthwhile. Its just starting to get to be too much. I just want to know if anyone has any advice or strategies to put themselves in better situations Looking for fulfillment in life",

Ask enough times and eventually the silence starts to eat away at you, at least it did me...I do not really think I believe in suicide as an answer here but it would be nice to not feel so damn alone and isolated in my own head.

We have different views and opinions and some people that are so hated are likely misunderstood. The light of Jesus is where we go to seek help and have a feeling of comfort. We are to love each other and have a minimum of a mutual understanding of each other. This is what I grew up to believe and I realize that it is a lie. People try to make it a competition and it does not matter what values you uphold or how pure your heart is. People want to see destruction and observe it like a movie while they snack on their popcorn. If you do not have even a nickel in your pocket, you are not worth a second of thought. But if you have even five dollars in your pocket, people will craft a new mask to put on their face in order to get close to you to reach into that back pocket of yours to take what little you have and insert a knife into your back. Not everybody has something wrong going in their life but rather had too much good in their life to understand how true human emotions work. They can go and stomp on your heart, shove all their riches and mental stability in your face, and make you grovel in pain until your will to live is thinner than a spider's web. People will fight to show you that they are right and that everything should revolve around their mindset and make us into mindless symbiotes to be bent and manipulated under their will. that is why we have politicians bending the truth and blinding us from the truth that we can no longer see under the pile of garbage they piled onto the world and presidents and rulers who make decisions that affect millions and make the big shot calls that could devastate many. Religion is the one thing in history that has lead to conflict and disputes on the origins of life and what awaits us after we die. We cannot comprehend everything in the world - let alone the ever-expanding universe. So why create a truth? Simply to just make us feel better with death and blot out the fear of the unknown. People are absolutely disgusting, violent, manipulative creatures who think they are superior to each other and find it necessary to better themselves through the destruction and torture of others. To all of that, I raise my middle finger to and hope the day comes when complete extinction of the human race comes upon us. Our Hearts Are Made of Glass and Minds of Clay",

But I need to rant, I need to get it out or it really is going to kill me. I am 16 right now, yeah pretty young I guess. Back when I was 14, I dated this one girl, puppy dog love, but it was fun while it lasted. Then I hooked up with another when I was 15, that is the extent of my experience.I have friends, they are a good bunch to be honest, but I feel alienated from them. All of them have had a 'glow up'?. What I am trying to say is that all of them have got something good going in life. Some are hooking up, some are dating, you get the idea. But I am static, I do not feel anything has changed for me. I am still the same height, arguably the same face and I feel like a fucking loser. I am average at academics, a little bit athletic; I train karate and boxing.Well today I met my friends. All of them, our friend group involves my ex-girlfriend if you can call her that. Well they all sort of broke of into groups, taking pictures, videos and whatnot. I was the only one left out. Me and my friend had planned to drop off my ex-girlfriend back to her house. What I am going to say next sounds fucking hilarious; but I thought maybe there is a chance for something there. Well that went away as soon as she told some of my other friends that she is not really comfortable with me coming along. I have some self respect of course, did not push after that.I feel like this is the final straw. I have done everything, I workout; I am in pretty good shape and my body reflects that. I speak confidently enough, I wear good quality perfume. I have a good dressing sense. that is what people have told me at least. But it is not enough, I have not gotten anything after my two earlier experiences. I had quit smoking a year ago. I started again, I have had a run-in with drugs, and alcohol. have not let it mess up my life. Completely quit drugs and I drink once a month.Well I smoked again today, I am thinking of drinking again. Might dabble with some safer drugs. I cannot do this shit anymore. Oh I suppose I am a porn addict as well. I have tried to quit a bunch of times. But I always relapse harder. A lot of this may be my own fault, maybe I did something wrong. But it just feels as I have been assigned a certain role in life. A role of rough highs and lows, except there are no highs. My friends cannot really help me, they would not understand. These are supposed to be my \"fun\" years but they are not, I just want to die peacefully at times. I guess whatever I may do, I cannot beat genetics. Maybe my face puts people off, my lips are slightly larger than normal I guess. Probably my insecurity speaking.However, whatever I do and I think I have done everything, I cannot seem to climb the wall. I cannot seem to beat the system. I always feared being nothing in life, but now that I come to think of it. That may be my destiny. I think I will just slowly start destroying myself, I might get cancer or something but I will have some amount of fun while doing it. But that is about it, I want today to mark the day I give up. They say hard times make strong people, I am not one of them and so I suppose it is natural that I will be cut out of the gene pool. I just wanted to share this with you guys, I am still young but this feels like the end. I will end with something I have learnt from experience; you can always fall further, and the pain numbs you at a certain point.I hope some of you make it out, I know I will not. Also probably should add, depression sort of runs in my family, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt. I do not know what to do anymore",

My earliest memories are of my father coming home drunk and high. Beating my mother. I would hide under the bed and play dolls with my sister. So she would not hear him beating her. I always wanted friends but never had any. I was the weird kid. I could not go into anyone's house unless invited. I remember peeing my pants outside the door because I was not invited in. I remember my father living 20 minutes down the road but never being there. Only holidays to look good in front of his parents. I remember my mother's family hating me. Telling me I would be just like him. How men are worthless. My stepfather beating me. How they would blame me and say I was lying. I remember being kicked out of the house while still in school for defending her when he raised a fist at her. Hitting him. Making him cry for his mom. I am not a good person I get it. I remember being homeless. I remember meeting my wife at my second job. Breaking into my grandparents house while they were gone for the winter. Drinking too much because I just wanted it to stop and the blackouts gave me peace. I remember the few years of happiness I had with my wife. Well as close to as someone like me can have. I remember us going to school and planning a future. I was going to be a chef. She wanted to be a writer. I remember the knock on my door. Hearing she was not ok. The hospital. Seeing her. Them telling me to call her family. Calling them. Not knowing what to say. She got a headache at work. She just started crying after sitting down and passed out they said. They sent her to a bigger better hospital. I remember driving there. I drove so fast. Reckless. They took her by helicopter. They did tests. I remember they told me she had an aneurysm. She was brain dead. Them asking me to sign papers to have her unplugged. To donate her organs. Her brother wanting her father to see her again. Her father that molested her. That molested more than her. Went to prison for it. I remember stalling so he could see her. I do not know if that was the right thing to do. I hated him. But she was his daughter. And for some reason it was important to her brother. I remember he was not supposed to touch her. I remember him touching her anyways. I remember breaking. I was already broken. I have been bipolar my whole life. I remember signing the papers to take her off life support. Not being able to be there when she passed. It was too much. I apologize. I was a kid. I could only handle so much. I was 23. I killed her with the stroke of a pen. You can say she was brain dead and already dead. But that was what ended it. I remember getting mail that told me about how her organs saved lives. Calling her family, even her father to them. I do not remember the next few years well. I drank a lot. I was trying to kill myself. I stayed with her family some and mine. I made unforgivable mistakes. I got angry. I came close to killing. I remember pulling a knife. I was going to commit suicide by cop. I remember the multiple times I tried to get help. I remember giving up. Going to a group home. Just hoping. I would get help. Trying so many medications. Counseling. Being left to rot. I spent near a decade there. I tried anything they offered. I failed me. They failed me as well. Never following through. Promising things that never happened. The group home was infested with bed bugs and cockroaches. Covered in bites always. My roommates all needed help that none of us got. I was jumped and had teeth broken out for being mistaken for one that was a sexual offender. After years of trying I had to leave as another was bringing weapons into the house. we would drink together. he would pull out one. Tell me if I did not kill him with it he would kill me then himself. I went to stay with my mom. I am having trouble typing more. I just need a break. I can finish later if anyone wants.

My mom said there are bullies everywhere and to just deal with it. Great advice there. What the fuck does that mean? My dad was more than happy to pull me out and let me be homeschooling, but mom said no so I had to stay miserable at school. By age 12 I just wanted to die and told the bullies in an AOL chatroom to which they just laughed at me and edged me to do it.Luckily, I never did do it. My father passed away and I was forced to live with my narcissistic mother. I did not know how to escape. I would dream about getting married and living somewhere else far away and never speaking to her again. I thought that was the answer to my problems. I mean, I was fired from a retail job because I could not clean the glass case properly and my mom had had enough of me being a failure with a useless Bachelor's Degree in Art. She says 14 year olds can last longer at McDonald's than me.By age 28 I was married to the love of my life and moved 3,500 miles away from where I grew up. I went no contact with my mom. I scored my dream job after being unemployed in a new country for 3 years, but now it is starting to catch up to me. I am 32 and becoming so stressed at work. I do not know how to cope. I just want to cry sometimes. I have read The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck and all kinds of self-help books, but they do not do anything for me.My neighbour bullies me just like the girls from middle school. I do not even know their name or why they do not like me. I am too afraid to leave my apartment because of it. The landlord does not care, the letting agent does not want to do anything, and the police have reported it and can only suggest we move.Finding a new place to live has been stressful. We have about 35,000 for a down-payment on a house and nobody wants to give us a mortgage. We make too much money for social housing. Right now my travel into work is dreadfully long. I do not drive so I have to take 3 buses.I am also infertile which was really hard for me to come to terms with. I also do not have any friends so if my husband were to leave me I would probably become homeless. I do not make enough to rent on my own.I just cannot deal with it. I remember asking my dad when he was alive how he dealt with stress and he said he did not know because he did not have any. Even my siblings say they are not stressed and think I am making it up for attention. My coworkers are not stressed or at least will not admit it. My boss just laughs in my face and thinks I am joking. I have tried looking for new jobs, but I have had 450+ rejections.I just want to be carefree and happy. I do not know where to go.

So she likes to act smart even if there is proof that it is right and she is wrong. it is her own thing I guess.But anyway I... Slipped into my old self.... I started being a dick and going out of my way to prove her wrong... And it... eventually hit me... And I have not talked much in two daysFriday morning (I think) I was up early (1:00ish) and I went to a bridge... I stood there for about 30 minutes... thoughts rushing though my head. Then I went home at like 3:00 since I have not been able to sleep. So I decided to wake my roommates (her and her boyfriend) and I opened up... And that is something I never did. I told them everything that was going on, about who I used to be... And the part that echos through my head... Is when she said something and the way my mind saw it was like... Kind of pitty in a way... And I got furious... I grabbed my shoes and I threw them against the wall. Then I stopped myself...I eventually went back to sleep... And I ended up crying a good portion of the day. I think my roommates thought I was asleep because they never checked on me. I eventually did fall asleep. Then I woke up around 8:00 and I went to find them. Maybe they were doing something. They were outside walking around playing Pokemon Go.I walked with them and I made some comments that... Old me would say... So I shut up... That was around 11:00 and it is now 3:00 for me... And I keep having that rushing thoughtIf I kill myself who would care?

For which I mean to say, I have seen better days, felt more like me...had a heartbeat with more lightness in it. If you are looking for someone to blame for it, it seems apparent to blame me. After all, I have no one to pin this on, except myself. And it has taken me years to accept that it might just be my fault anyway...not a factor of different traumas, and past abuse...not a lack of understanding the cruelty of the world around me and discovering dissapointment like I discovered my own talents......me....this is all my fault...for being the way I am...for making you all worry and look at me with bewilderment and disinterest...I do not blame you...I have blamed myself for years for it...I think I still do. But, just know that for each and every punishment I receive, self inflicted, my faults are being corrected. that is why I am in this cage you see. that is why I cannot come out...I have tossed out the key, so I would not think to ask for it. And now, I just wait here...in the darkness. I wait for the end. But it will not come. Of course not...I am in a cage. Nothing can get in here to kill me...except for myself. Oh do not worry my friends. I will not do anything too bad. Certainly will not leave without telling you all first...though it is tempting to. After all...did you really remember me when I was gone for all those years?...perhaps, you thought of me, every so often. Maybe there was something in your day, a voice, a joke, a toy, a song, a movie, that reminded you of me. That put a smile on your face, thinking of the good times we shared together...a nice afternoon in the summer, sharing ice cream....a pizza party with a game of hide and go seek.....a sleepover with pajamas and board games....maybe video games and anime....maybe a friendly dinner and a walk through the town....I miss those times too. But they are all over. Dead and still, only living in our minds. I want to join those memories, but I cannot you say, not when I can make new menories...not while I can have better times.But to be honest...from this cage of mine, I do not see how I can. So I sit and lie down and roll around...clutching the memories I have. I am not brave enough to ask you all for more. I am not brave enough to welcome new ones. I have...been stripped of my courage. I am naked. Cold and silent. Unable to cry for help...like a fish out of water. I am only able to struggle in my suffocation...I am drying out...I gaze up and away...I lay still. I want to give up. I need someone to return me to myself again. I do not ask you to do this for me. I am a slippery fish. I am an unwilling victim of self-awareness. I will resist and bite and run. I will run. I will hide....I am afflicted by something that prevents me from getting rid of it, little by little...and it is powerful. It grips me with a vice, and uses my stripped courage as a trophy to intimidate me. it is a monster. And it is myself. I am it is underling. I serve it, and obey it is command....and the orders are killing me.Soon I will not be so alone my friends. I might not be anything. Or I might have company. I might actually be understood. I am sorry I am so presumptuous in assuming that you do not understand me, but...that is simply what this monster tells me. Each and every one of you I know, has problems. Has struggles. Has traumas. I do not understand them...so why would you understand mine? Not while I see your shining lives and sunny faces convey a message of health to me, that I am distant from. I lament my ignorance and my innocence, though I try to hold onto what is left of it is destroyed remains. I have cried, and grieved over the places I used to go for comfort, no longer welcome to me. I have nothing....I have...no one...because of this cage. Please, you need not claim your loyal hold on our friendship and make the effort to be there. I would think the world of it...and I would also panic immensely about it. My trust, having been shaken so much, I worry that I will not have much trust left if I give it away so freely. It must hurt to hear from me that I cannot put my trust in you....I am sorry....I do not mean to hurt you. I only mean to push you away, and to reject your kind words and thoughts and gestures...so I can stay in this dark. So you cannot take me away from the monster trying to kill me. I just want to make you leave me alone, so I can help this cursed monster spread into you. I need to deterr you from helping me, even though your help is something that will save my life. I need to keep you from caring about me because if I do not...I am going to feel like a total, parasitic burden. I am going to feel it all at once...I am going to break down, into the soft-fleshed, vulnerable, delicate little creature I am. There will be nothing to keep you from hurting me the most, and I will be in such as state the likes of which has not been seen. I will need comfort, and if I go without it, I will be hurt just as much as if you would step on me. I will be helpless. I will be weeping rivers. All the anger, and loneliness and years of loathing and self-pity will come in a wave so large I will catch a cold from the tears I leave behind. I am in pain to tell you this...but I know you do not need this in your life. You do not need to help me. You do not need to care. You do not need to feel so sorry. I know you have better things to do. You have people that care for you more than I do. You have lives to live. You have things to look forward to. You must. Because I do too. I just cannot see them from where I am.Dear friends...I hope maybe I can see you again someday. I hope I can make you proud someday. I hope you understand...I wish I could be myself with you again...

She got out of a relationship this past May and long story short, she wanted to stay as friends because we just were not on the same level. she is just not ready for anything despite the feelings she has for me.

Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story short(ish), naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs, got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife, watched her nearly die due to OD, wandered several states homeless, and got constantly reminded that she did not love me, but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born, she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life, but there was no way in hell I could do that, especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born, so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious, so during the divorce/custody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun, saying I was physically/sexually abusive, a pedophile, that I trafficked her, etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit, but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times, because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end, she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father (were in a deep red state), and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long, but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily, my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom re-married, had another daughter, then around the time my daughter was 8, she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to who-knows-where.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life, not for myself, but for empathy for my daughter. I have to watch as my daughter now has occasional panic attacks, I have to listen as she occasionally weeps in the other room, and I have to feel guilty as a small hateful part of me is glad that her mom is gone and cannot spread anymore poison. I try to suppress that part and I feel like a terrible person because of it.tl;dr Married a deeply troubled person who killed herself and I have mixed feelings about it. My ex-wife, mother of my daughter, killed herself.",

But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit.

Getting paid that much at 24 years old makes me feel like I have failed right out of the gate. I budgeted like a mad man and was able to save about 40k for a down payment for a house. But the market is so insane that we cannot even come close to the offers. I feel like I have done all of that budgeting for nothing.. I spent 19 years of my life being a devoted Christian believing every word and building my faith. My degree in psychology showed me that my faith was incorrect and taught me to look for evidence in what I believe. I feel so isolated because my wife still believes along with nearly all of my friends. My wife knows and she has been very supportive. My parents keep asking me when I am getting a new job.I applied for a new one I was accepted but they wanted to pay me around 15 percent LESS than I am making now. I am starting to drink and get high nearly everyday and I have picked up a porn addiction that I thought I got rid of. Resentment towards my wife because I feel like I get rejected atleast 3-4 times a week for sex. And now I am starting to blow my money that I worked hard for on nothing.. Idk I have pretty much everything going for me and I know I should be thankful I just keep getting caught in this route of wanting perfection and I keep comparing myself to others.

And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead.

But I am starting to feel like I am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worrying.Everytime I am driving I am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to.

I do not consider him anything close to a father figure, but he is the only thing I have other than teachers, counselors, or school staff. Fighting has taken a toll on me, a lot. I am always the one at fault and he makes sure to phrase it in a way that makes me the one in the wrong, always. This has ended up with me scared of loud noises, feeling like a failure, feeling unloved, depressed, scared of hurting people, scared of being around people, scared of making mistakes, scared of offending people, scared of authoritarian figures that would coincide with father figures, defensive, rude in many cases, and in some ways, unable to properly read cues, though this might be an autism thing. For just over ten years, we have been digging a huge pit of anger and hate, mainly my hate for him, and the grief that comes with not feeling loved by someone who you see everyone else loved by. The depression stemming from the constant battling has ended me up in hospital three times due to being suicidal after fights, mainly because I feel like a disappointment. I end up wanting to punch him in the face, push him out the door, and lock every single entrance but I will never be strong enough emotionally for that. I am already a failure as is.I find it incredibly hard to cry, mainly because of how much I did in the early years, and have ended up being semi-violent when it comes to confrontations with him. I will end up throwing things or slamming doors because I want to get away from him at all costs, I want to put something in between me and him. This usually ends up with me wanting to kill myself, like today. I did the only thing I could think of in the midst of the pain and depression today, I left the house and walked to the open space nearby. there is a bench there I am fond of. I managed to cry up there. I am glad nobody was out today. I contemplated commiting. I am glad I did not. I contemplated running away. I am glad I did not. The only thing keeping me sane is the people I love and I hate it so much. I feel like I should live for more than just spite and to make others happy. I just want to be happy.The thing that hurts the most is when I see families having fun together. A dad and his child reading a book on the sidewalk. A mom and her daughter walking the family pets. A husband and wife taking their toddler in a stroller.It makes me feel raw hate. Hate to myself that I cannot be a better person. Hate to myself that I cannot have that because I cannot control what little temper I have. Hate that despite everything I do, he cannot take responsibility for anything. I hate it. I hate me.How can I be happy when my whole life is pain and sadness? How can I be happy when the person I am supposed to look up to despises me more than the dogs I pass in their yards? Why do the *dogs* pause to see if I am ok longer than he does. I want happiness. Please. I would give anything for that peace.tldr: I am in pain. I hate myself, my dad, everything I am. I just want happiness. I feel like shit and I need to rant. Thisll be long, you do not have to read. Tw; suicide, self harm",

I cannot be around other people without having a whirlwind of negative emotions such as fear, sorrow, anger, etc. Perhaps I spend too much time on social media but just by observing people, I find that they can be incredibly cruel. You can see this for yourself, just look at the comments section of any youtube video and witness the discourse and anger that flows naturally through people. In my home town, there are large masses of homeless people, and it makes me sad seeing so many folks hit rock bottom. I have seen groups of teenagers beat down on said homeless people right in front of me. I have seen people do drugs, yell, fight, stab, rob. I have seen women do the most awful things to their children in public without any repercussions. I have overheard people spread hatred of other people. I have had family members die in horrible ways. I had old classmates who ended their own lives. I witnessed a man try to commit suicide on the highway.

But for some reason, I cannot help but love other people. However, this love does not dissuade me from wanting to leave this world. As childish as it sounds, I just wish that I could be born into a life where these issues are nonexistent. Despite being disturbed by appalling human behavior, I cannot help but fixate on it.

My best friend, who I have always been in love with since we were in high school, got in a new relationship and does not call me anymore. The boy I started to like a lot, ghosted me out of the blue. And that just felt like another abandonment.Friends that I cared about, ended our friendship over something they did and blamed me for. I have no job. My moneys running out. And I am just getting closer and closer to dying.When I die, all of these people will say how close they were to me. And yet, at the first chance they got, they were all gone. I have been going to the lake park near my house almost every night. I think its the place Ill drown myself in. This life is just too much for some of us. No matter how many chances and tries we give it, sometimes we just were not meant to live to see old age. I have done a lot of things in my life. Made a difference in peoples life. Ill be remembered by someone. I have stayed around for my family. Stayed around for the hope that one day, something will remind me that I am still alive. everyone is keep telling me things will be different, but I have felt this way since I was a teenager.I always said, Id die at 27. Be a part of the 27 club. Just to be a part of something. But even that seems like an impossible dream to make it to.I am tired. And I keep seeing my mother calling to me to come home. I miss her. She was the only one that ever understood me. And I just want to go be with her and put myself out of this misery. I ask God every night to not let me see the next day. And yet, here I still am. everyone is moved on, and do t even notice I am slipping",

I could break my leg twice in one day, but eventually, it will heal and I will walk on by. But when the heart is broken, I am not sure if it ever truly heals. I think we simply grow used to the pain and allow it to make us tough. Not stronger, but tough. They say it gets easier day-by-day and that is not untrue, but it feels like they are shrinking an experience so raw and gut-wrenching into something as insignificant as a papercut. I think in many cases when we lose someone without actually losing them, it hurts more than if they were really gone. The pain is unbearable knowing they are somewhere living life, waking up every day and having coffee with someone else, and dreaming of their life without you. it is like staying in a hotel with paper-thin walls, rooming next to them when they are with the person they love and you are in the room next door. Standing on the bed, ear to the wall, alone. Sunshine does not feel the same when we are hurt. Instead of our skin soaking up the rays and allowing them to seep into our pores and giving us sun-kissed skin, they beat down on us and burn us until we are red. Fighting the pain can be just as hard as accepting it. Trying to pretend like everything is okay like we are not hurting so bad that sometimes we wish the sun would not rise in the morning. Wanting to stay in the dark because it is easier than watching something as beautiful as a sunrise leave you every night. But maybe this is a blessing, a sign from the universe that reminds us we are human. We feel pain because if we did not how could we ever know the true immense joy of love? The diving-headfirst-into-the-deep-dark-unknown-putting-our-faith-and-heart-in-the-hands-of-the-one-person-our-hearts-beat-for kind of love. The bitter truth is our hearts may never really be the same and we will walk away with scars. But we have to remember that one day we will wake up and our hearts will hurt less, we will go out for coffee by ourselves and not feel alone, we will dream about things other than what hurt us, we will meet people who love us, and we will experience things that make our hearts flutter. Because that is life. Eventually, the sunshine will not burn us and we will feel the warmth of its rays like a blanket over our shoulders, comforting us as we accept love and pain at the same time. And when the sky fades, a blaze of color will drop onto the horizon, then darkness will fall. And we will not wish for the darkness to stay forever anymore because we can find peace in knowing that the sun will always rise in the morning. just some thoughts",

I do also remember being punched for being gay at the age of 13 by older men in their 18's, I also remember being raped by 2 cops when I was going home from my office when I was 21, I remember swallowing a lot of pills when I was 7 and tightening a rope around my neck when I was 9. I remember loosing an amazing friend one summer day because I did not feel like seeing him at all, because how could I explain that I was feeling vulnerable for the assaulted I have lived in the past, I remember how my father stop seeing me because I was not man enough and I did not know how to catch a ball with my hands, I remember walking home when I was 8 during a hurricane wanting to be blown away by the gusts of wind and I remember loosing the man I loved that die during a tragedy. A man that always told me how strong I was even though I do not have the physique he used to have, he was muscular, strong and kind as a gentle giant, still he always looked at me when we wake up as I was \"Hercules\" or some hero of the ancient times and he used to say: \"My love I wish someday I could be half as strong as you are\". &amp;#x200B;I want to jump into the abyss or more like just stop holding on to life, but I do not want to die. I want to live, I want to leave behind my bad memories and my demons and my errors. If you God can read this I still believe with all my heart in you, I also know that you can see me. And in fact you are right here next to me, trying to reach my broken mended heart. It is silly to think that falling into the abyss will solve anything, but I am loosing my strength I have zero today, my heart is aching and my soul feels heavy and numb. I will not quit on living because I do want to deserve a happy ending, I want to be a nice, gentle man. Not a perfect one, not even a happy one. Just one with a future for me to build, I do not dream about travels, love, hope, boyfriends, friends, videogames or anything at all.I just want a second chance please, I will make it count and I will be humble about it. And that is my letter to you dear reader as you I do try to fight my very own darkness to keep it at bay, so that monster will not swallow me and let me still in my bed while my family sleeps on the same house. I have feel so much guilt in my life for being here, for being alive, for being able to breath. While so many people has lost their life due to and illness or an accident or a murderer. So my brothers and sisters out there can any of you help me lit my light because the night is here and I feel my light dimming and dying out, so please anyone out there.Be kind to me and bestow a little of your light so I can traverse this night and not fall into the void.With tears in my eyes, your brother Alex.

She has endured child sexual abuse and never healed, and every time she got hurt throughout her life it just deepend that wound and reinforced the idea in her mind that people are abusive and out to hurt each other.Because of certain events her depression has gotten worse throughout our relationship. At first it was anxiety attacks, or perhaps she hid the other stuff from me then. Now I can see she is worse than ever after a relative died. She feels she is a burden to everyone, and mostly, she feels there is no hope, that she has been suffering like this for decades, and that there is no hope for her to ever get better and live a normal life.Her average day is being constantly on edge and scared of everything. I can see in her eyes she is just exhausted. Some days she just lies in bed, stiff as a board just looking at the ceiling and crying repeating \"I do not want this anymore\" over and over softly.Recently talks of ending it have become somewhat frequent. I cannot force her to go to a health clinic, and I am in that situation where if I call them to pick her up she will not trust me again or experience it as another betrayal. In the end they will release her within a week or two and it all starts again, but then I will not be near to support her and that might be more dangerous.The other side of the coin is that I am also just a human. I am overworked, I get tired, I get annoyed sometimes. it is a lot to carry for me and I realize I am just not everything a person with severe depression could need. I am not always soft and understanding, I am not always right there to hold her hand. I feel for her, and this situation is in my head all day every day, but selfish as it is, I am also at that age where people generally go through a lot of big milestones and I have plans and goals for the future and they are all on hold. Even though her safety is more important right now, I do feel frustrated because it feels like my life is so uncertain and stagnant.I just do not know what to do or how to deal with this situation.I do not know if I am even a good thing for her. Sure I comfort her when she has anxiety attacks, and I do what I can to be supportive. But the very fact that we have a relationship is also putting pressure on her. She feels like she is not a good partner, like she is \"withholding\" sex from me. Like she is taking away my chance at a good future. Even though I try to tell her that is not the case, she still feels like that. The sex is a non-issue. She is not a bad partner because she is going through depression I can live with all that. Underneath she is an amazing person that I love to spend time with. But she is right about the other thing, I suppose. What if her depression never ends? What if truly she cannot ever overcome it and live a somewhat normal life. Am I a horrible person for not being able to see that in my future? I have had that feeling for months now. I do not tell her any of this, because that is not something she should carry now. I am kind of just waiting it out and trying to have a good relationship and hoping that she does get better at least to some degree, so that those feelings end up irrelevant.I have so many emotions and most of them conflict some way or another. I do not know what to do anymore. How to care for someone on the edge?",

        "input": "Unfortunately, I am 17F and three months away from turning 18 I do not expect medical advice but just to rant. A year ago I was in a psych ward after a previous attempt of suicide and I was assigned to see a therapist since I got discharged and I had multiple fucked up episodes since, the most recent one costing me my job temporarily. I was out of work for a month my therapist told me it was likely I have bipolar disorder and assigned for me to see a doctor the next month. We do not have a car so my narcissistic father had to take me but told me he could not take us (he did not want to do it because I yelled at him for yelling at my mother for asking for financial support and saying that that is exactly why he left her). He refused to take me after waiting a month for care because I \"swore\" at him for blaming us for his bullshit narcissism. He said to my mother until I apologize for my actions he is going to stop taking care of me (dental needs, doctors appointments, etc.) My mom does not believe in medication and I am not really a fan either, but since bipolar has been pointed out to me the hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, impulsive decisions, and suicide attempts, make sense because of the dramatic shifts in my moods a few times a year. I believe I am manic at the moment because my decision making gets waaaaay more fucked up than usual and I am loud, fast talking, energized, and have not slept for more than 5 hours a night and now I am not sleeping at all regardless of 9 hours shifts at work. I only have insight now because it happened to me so many times. I am really irritable at my mother because I have to be like this because until I am 18 I have no say in my care. She does not believe in medicine and I do not like medicine either but I do not want to be like this anymore. She calls me dramatic when I feel like I am going through hell in my mind. Everyone just feels the need to call me a bitch:Me: *Did not sleep AT ALL after closing at work and when I almost had a remote chance at sleeping my niece starts screaming her head off*My sister: *who recently shit on me for crying about a recent miscarriage I had at a baseball game and asking to go home when she wanted to see fucking BIG AND RICH (lmao) literally yelled at me the whole time for asking to leave in front of zillions of people starts hissing at me and blaming me for waking up her child when she was clearly already awake and screaming when I got up*Me: *Pissed because of this*My sister: \"you are SUCH A BITCH!\" Then there is my mom:Me: *exhausted but cannot sleep due to the episode*My mom: \"Take out the garbage.\"Me: \"Okay.\"My mom: \"I said do it now! I do everything around here and you just lay there.\"Me:*did not sleep after work, just hates life in general and does not want to react the way I do but she keeps freaking out* \"IT WILL GET DONE I PROMISE YOU!\"My mom: \"You always say that. You always have to have things done your way.\" *Proceeds to threaten to call my dad or someone to yell at me*Me:*Yells expletives out of extreme anger, starts screaming and covering ears because of sensory overload, and BEGS her to leave me alone because NOTHING would be more relieving at that point*My mom: *Walks away* \"you are so dramatic.\"My mom does not get that I have a disease in my brain. She makes me live like this and it makes me so angry when she says stuff like that.My dad in a nutshell: *Is bipolar himself, narcissistic, and blackmails me for taking care of me*I hate it when people try to tell me that it is because I am \"a teenager\" I want those people to go to hell. I have tried to die 3 times, cannot function without a stimulant, lost a child, was shit on for having feelings about it, have abandonment issues because of my dad leaving when I was one, forcing me to be in this world with these problems and then replacing me AND HE STILL does not LET US FORGET! LOL (not to mention people who have called me a mess and left and used me on a romantic level), have three current diagnoses already, and if I express myself I get called a bitch or \"Somebody has it worse\"I am done.I feel like genuinely crying but my moods will not let me. I deal with manic episodes and I am called dramatic by my mother who will not let me go on medication *Not as long of a story as it looks*",

I was diagnosed with Major Depression while I was in High School along with anxiety, and Tourette Syndrome. I have been battling suicidal thoughts ever since then and I have been hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric facility three times. I cannot remember if being inpatient actually helped me though. I have been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a little over a year and have had two acute series done. The ECT has ruined my memory and it does not seem to be helping any longer. I had a treatment done on Monday and was already feeling severely depressed and suicidal by Tuesday night. I do not know what to do.I could commit myself again, but my brother's white coat ceremony is coming up and I need my PTO to be able to fly out there to see it. I also do not want my family to worry. I love them and they are the only reason that I have not killed myself yet. I also do not even know if its worth it. I have been inpatient three times already and the suicidal thoughts are still there. I do have a couple of good things going on in my life though. I have a great job and a extremely loving family that is almost always willing to put up with a call from me because I know it helps my depressed mood. I have told everyone that I talk to regularly (my brother, sister, aunt, uncle, Dad, and Mom) that I have been feeling down and that talking to them helps improve my mood. However, I have been struggling with the feeling that I am starting to call them too often. I just do not want to bother them. To make things worse, my therapist is currently on maternity leave. I have a substitute therapist but that just is not the same. On top of my depression, my anxiety is so severe that I am unable to make friends. I have not had a friend since high school and that was only because I was friends with my twin brother's friends. I just get so flustered when I am around people that I can barely talk. I have no work friends, they all just know me as the quiet guy. I do not know. Everything just feels like too much. I am so tired and frustrated. I am just ready for everything to be over.

        "input": "Is been a while since i posted and left the things halfways. I explained how I was forced to quit from a well paying work and have been unable to recover economically since. I have severe trust issues now and have become very bitter and cynical. Last time I also told you about how i started wandering alone afterwork looking for troubles until i was finally assaulted and went so far as to goad my aggressor to pull the trigger on me. So I started therapy. I was still being somewhat supported by both my exs, one helped me find a place to stay and try to recover enough to find a job again and the other one lend me her shoulder and listened to me whenever she could, i was grateful for that. Then the therapist made me realize a few things. First of all that i was right to be depressed, my story was harsh, and she was amazed i went for so many years without looking for help. I told her that i already do things to stave off depressions since i sculpt, write and do digital art as a hobby, but lately that was not enough, i felt and i still feel like i do not get joy from it anymore. She suggested we started with telling her about myself, about my relation with my family, with my friends, etc. So it turned out that i was not only depressed but had repressed over 20 years of anger, since i always acted as a mediator or a problem solver, i barely ever let out my anger be shown. I have adandomnent issues because of a very traumatic episode that ocurred when i was five and is something that keeps on dragging with both my ex's leaving me at some point, although both cases were amiable enough i got hurt and moved on or tried to move on. This feels like senseless ramble, sorry. So i quited my job on the call center. I move cities again and had to stop seeing my therapist because of money being short. I started working at a winestore and i kept bashing my head against the boss's. He was an idiot. I also understood that i have a very difficult time working with people face to face. I am not only assertive but also quick to lash out against costumers and the boss if i feel atacked somehow. I left the place after a year, they did not fire me because even though all the fights, i was a good worker, and one of the few that did not quit after 2 weeks of work because of it being too hard. I left on my own volition after a discussion about the contract, and since i was a petty jerk y waited enough to time my quitting with the holydays, so bossman would have to cover my absence himself. Just after quitting, i got on a fight with a close friend, and my landlord decided to evict me just because. Actually i know the reason but since the place was offered by a \"friend\", i took it at something they would go \"backsies\" later on. Trust issues, man. Since i was getting evicted i stopped looking for a job, took my stuff and returned to my folks places, which does not make me happy. I was wanting to burn my savings on the therapy again but i felt bad about using money while not having a job, then covid came and jobs became more difficult to get. One of my ex's finally decided to push me into drawing lewds for commission. It was an old idea i never truly tried because I am not comfortable about it, is not something i like. But my regular art never got attention. With her help i created a super corny/girly/nonethreatening handler for deviant and off i went to draw shit for other people. She just asked me to never show her the stuff, and i could comply with that since i m not comfortable letting anyone else that i know see it, although close friends have been warned. I started to get some traffic, with it some commissions. I started saving money again, and thought of calling my therapist again to see how we could work into improving myself or my life, since i ve never stopped having suicidal thoughts. Then my ex let me know that she was having a hard time being there for me, she made me feel as a liability and cut contact with me completely. And i had a meltdown, she had been my closest friend through the whole ordeal and now she leaves. So instead of calling my therapist to improve myself, i tell her i feel miserable, wronged, sad, and still want to die. I want the pain to stop, I am more scared of keep hurting than of died, a week before a roof almost fell over me and i did not even react. I am numb to that, but i do not like hurting I am tired of that. I am tired of this, so why should i drag this on? And now I also understand that I feel emotionally alone, and even if a stop feeling hurt, that will not change easily. TLDR: random rant and followup to last post. My world just got smaller (follow up)",

Horrible hand eye coordination, always picked last in sports, ooor academic performance, socially clueless. I hate myself. But more than that, I despise everyone else. I want to go on a msss shooting and massacre a bunch of retards so that they will will feel terror and pani, and maybe it would be cathartic. You are all so lucky I have not been able to get my gun license. I am poisonously envious of anyone with something I want. Intimate relationships, friendships, money, a degree, independence, respect, charisma, beauty, youth. If you have one of these things, the best I can do is feign indifference. I cannot pretend to be happy for tlothers any longer. I wish them only the worst. I do not care about fairness. I do not care about who earned what. There is no such thing as deserve in a deterministic universe. I repeat, I would love to horribly injure and ruin peoples lives, not because they deserve it, but because it would be cathartic for me. I would especially love to stab every cunt who has ever yttered the phrase pull yourself up by the bootstraps or other such normie fucktardstion. I am not interested in fitting into this society. I want every single person to die, and for no more to come afterwards. Ah, that would be an antnatalist paradise. I am done fighting",

        "input": "If I believed in some type of a joyful eternal afterlife, I might be able to guess that any resilience evidenced within this earthly lifetime would ultimately be rewarded to a way more intense degree than any I could imagine inside my simple, small intellect. I just impulsively checked for some relevant data online and found out that there might be something like over 2 billion Christians on earth.But as it remains, I believe that possibly nothing special happens to us after we die. Following death, there is just immediate darkness, silence, numbness -- nothing. The experience of death is akin to the experience of deep dreamless sleep.I can vividly remember how incredibly purposeful my life felt during childhood, when I was thoroughly religious and believed that everything I was doing was being gleefully monitored by a loving God (or maybe multiple gods) who wanted the best for me and other humans. But as the years passed and I encountered more and more unanswered / blatantly ignored prayers, I grew to express some minimal amount of basic skepticism toward the idea that any deity loves us or actively participates in our lives.While I will not get specific about my problems within this post, I will just mention in passing that I have almost certainly suffered much more than at least 80% of my generation's peers. And as my suffering has gotten worse across time, I have come to reach a point at which I have found no higher purpose to my suffering -- there is no probable reward one faces for continuing to deal with severe, crippling, life-ruining depression.Laughable as this may seem, I used to believe that continued suffering would result in the cultivation of continued wisdom, almost as if the reward for ongoing pain was to become a goldmine of hard-won insights which could (one day) easily wrest a fresh interlocutor out of fairly deep suffering via pithily expressed wisdom. But now all I deal with each day is a sort of ... numb resignation before a potentially premature end to life.What am I supposed to do if I can realistically expect sporadically increasing suffering in my near and continued future? In the absence of religious belief, there seems to be no way to derive any sense of meaning or fulfillment from a life of serious and potentially mind-destroying suffering.Life feels like it is losing its meaning with each passing day. Does my suffering have no higher purpose?",

That kind of connection to another human, recognize my pain. This post is not about that, it may seem like it is, I suppose, but it is not. I guess, I just want to tell the story of why I have depression and anxiety and so many other mental illnesses. it is going to be a long post, and for that, I do not expect many people to read it.I have contemplated suicide, but never attempted it. By contemplate, I mean I held a gun in my hand, looked it up and down, loaded it, put it in my mouth, put it against my head, and thought very deeply about pulling the trigger. I have contemplated suicide for at least 10 years now. It has put me in a state where I am both godless and god-fearing. The best place to start, I think, is the first trauma I remember and go from there. When I was about 5-6 I had a crush on a boy in my class. If it matters, I am a bisexual male, more on that later. Well, I was quite innocent of the idea of love and what one should like and not like, so I told my mom about the crush. Her response was to scratch me across the face and call me a faggot. I still have the scars to this day. Four scars on the left side of my face. I made a post the other day showing my face, but you cannot really see them, I do not like to draw attention to them, and thankfully no one has ever asked about them.That is the tip of the iceberg. When my parents were still together, she would lock us out of the house. Hot summer days in the Ohio River valley. We would be out there for hours, upwards of 6 hours without water or food. And really I guess this is the lesser of it, not so bad, we were kids, play outside she would tell us. So we did, we just could not go back in until she called us. Anyways, I really looked forward to school days. This went on for a few years, I was between the ages of 5 and 10.School itself was not so bad. I did not learn to read until I was in the 3rd grade, and I was always taken out of class because I had special classes I had to go to, including one for a speech impediment, I could not say my Rs, the speech impediment went on till I was almost in High School.Well, when my parents got divorced was when the fun really began, I say fun because I try to think on the lighter side of it, could have been worse. I remember every aspect of the father's first apartment. We lived near a small airport, the house was two stories, we lived on the first floor. Entering the house, on the right was a staircase that led upstairs to the landlord's apartment. Directly in front of the front door was the door that led into the basement, where the washer and dryer were, concrete floors, largely empty space, was not much in there. The third door was my father's apartment, to the left. A white door, it led into the living room. There was a fireplace, a smallish TV, the couch my sister slept on, my dad's drawing table, and a couple of bookcases. In fact, I am going to stop here and suffice to say that I could describe to you every detail of that apartment. All except my room. I can not tell you anything about my room. I do not know what color the door was, I do not know what side of the wall the beds were on, I know nothing about that room. What I do know, or at least strongly suspect, is that I was raped in that room over a period of 2 years. Aforementioned memory lapse aside, I am told by my brother that I say \"No, do not do it, stop\" in my sleep quite often. My sister, deceased sister, had similar gaps of memory and told me one day that she suspected it was happening. And thirdly, NSFW warning, my anus has a tear in it. I was about 12-14, as memory serves that I lived in that apartment on the weekends. A mighty bold claim, I do not remember the actual events, but I believe there is evidence to lead to that conclusion. I want to think that I am wrong, but part of me tells me it is true.There are more minor things in my childhood that come to mind, but I think they really do pale compared to what I have already said. To this day, my family is, well, unloving. They will tell me they love me, but they do not show it. In fact, the only time they really listen, or half-listen, is when I threaten suicide. This could be why I contemplate it so much, just to be heard. Neither of my parents could give a shit about what inspires me, what passions I have, what love I feel. Two examples, I wanted to be a paleontologist until I was 16, loved dinosaurs, I kept this, like many other things, to myself., until one day I told my dad. He said I would never be a paleontologist, I should give up on that idea, and that I should instead be an engineer like he was. The second example, I love playing the piano, I know virtually nothing about it, I am self-taught, and frankly, I feel I can play a pretty damn good improv. My mother, frequently, tells me I am terrible at it and that I need lessons. Which may very well be true, I may be terrible and everyone else who has heard me play is lying to me, I do certainly need lessons because I cannot read music, although I do not have much interest in playing what someone else wrote, it is an emotional release for me and I like it that way, so I am stubborn.Perhaps some of this post is just whining, I need to grow up, I need to move on. I should not be defined by my past or what others say. And most of the time I try to keep that mindset, what is in the past is in the past, but (I was once told by a very wise man to not use the word but, because it negates everything you said before, I feel it is needed here) the past can still hurt. And perhaps that is why I am making this post, not on a throwaway account, I thought about that. But like my scars, let the world see this, my past does define me in some way, it has certainly shaped me. I have come to the end of this post and I still don' know the purpose. It does not make it feel any better, and no one can go back and change any of this, and quite frankly I am not even depressed about it right now. I was earlier today when my brother threatened to kick me out because I have not done the dishes in a few days, but not at the moment of writing. Maybe, and I think this is true, maybe I just need someone to know these things. Not because it has any real impact on their life, I certainly do not think anyone is going to read this and say, MY GOD, MY LIFE IS CHANGED. No, I think I just wanted someone to know my pain, my past. I suppose I am sorry you read that. Me",

Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it, my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me, he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair, I know this is happening I just cannot stop it, meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a full-time alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself, I am open-minded, but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore, pre-pandemic I was doing my dream job, still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available, being mistreated at each company of course, I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our pre-existing issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child, people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate, like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help, albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all, I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness, I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted, I do not need money I just want fulfillment, I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate, I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem!

Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).December 2017: After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.January 2018: After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.March 2018: I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about \"emotional numbness\" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.April 2018: I am at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.August 2018: Decide I am good and that I do not need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I did not see. T-boned a taxi.September 2018: Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of \"if you were not on Zoloft, your jaw would not have broken\" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I \"cannot leave this earth\" in tears.October 2018: Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.April 2019: I buy a penis enlargement device \"just because\" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a \"hard flaccid\" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.May 2019: Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.September 2019: I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.October 2019 - January 2021: Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid did not make things any easier, but whatever.February 2021: I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that is the reason I cannot perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.March 2021: I go off of Wellbutrin.\\*\\*\\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.\\- - - - - - - - - - -End of June 2021: I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw did not click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral.\\*\\*first scare here\\*\\* (July 2, 2021): I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed (I am at my parent's house here). I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I do not cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently, but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case, and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work, and the rest of the family is at our vacation house, so I was home alone.July 3, 2021: I decide to do something, so I book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18-holes from the tips here at our home course, with a 33 (-3) on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine, and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in college/throughout highschool that I will not get into.

Everything.I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I am unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really do not know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say \"I am really having a tough time here man. I do not know what to do.\"10:24am July 4, 2021: I hit \"post\" here on Reddit, then grab my keys and head into town for my habitual coffee. Feeling a bit better after getting this off my chest.

He said that I am not a real man for my decision and that I am extremely selfish for letting the family down. He now wants nothing to do with me, and is going to take my car because its still under his name when he gave it to me at 16 which I do not know how to get to work now. This is the only time I have ever stood up for myself on a issue and now he hates me. My dad just disowned me",

        "input": "I apologize if my English writing is unclear. This is a bit of a rant. I have been very miserable for a very long time, at least in relation to how long I have been alive (16). My earliest memories of wanting to die was when I was 11ish, and it has not improved since. I find it very hard to find and keep close friends and I have no close relationship with my family. My parents are extremely socially conservative and do not take mental health seriously. My brother tried to commit suicide back in 2019 and even then they treated it as a \"mindset issue\". I cannot go to him or any of my other siblings because I do not have that type of relationship with them. We were pitted against each other at a very young age and the resentment is still there. It feels like getting professional mental health treatment is out of the question while I am living with my family, they do not even like to take me to the doctor. I do not feel like I have a future. For the past 2 months I have lay in my bed and felt miserable because I have been too afraid to get a job, or apply to things I need to apply to, or practice and get better at my one real extracurricular (fencing). I do nothing and I tell myself it does not matter because I am not going to reach the future anyways because I am going to commit suicide. But, I know I do not have the courage to do so, but I do not have the courage to fix my life either. When school starts in about 3 weeks I know I am going to have completely fucked myself over because in my school you are required to have a current resume, and they expect it to be constantly changing and evolving and I have nothing. I have done nothing in the past year and nothing to show. In addition, I enrolled to be in an internship program in which I can intern with local legal firms (police or lawyer), but I have not been even trying to contact these places. I have not because I am too afraid to call them when I cannot email, and none of the places I emailed have responded (from a month ago).The one extracurricular I have (fencing) I am not even good at, because I started in late October of last year and in comparison to my peers, all high level ranked, I am a joke. I started too late. I have no skills I am good at, because my parents generally ignored me for my siblings (who all succeed in the sports and arts they choose to do) and encouraged little from me. So I did nothing because I had no passion for anything.I cannot even leave my house and do the one thing I love to do anymore. I used to love to go on walks in nature but I cannot anymore. I hate going outside and feeling inferior to everyone. I do not even know why at this point. I cannot even admit to myself how bad I feel. Every time I do I cannot help but minimize my own problems. I cannot help but feel like there is no reason for me to feel as bad as I do ( I am middle class and have both parents in the picture). I cannot help but think everything I am listing is just stupid melodramatic teenage bull and its not worth hurting myself over (which it prolly is not). But it still just hurts my heart so much. I hate feeling like I am a waste of potential. I hate feeling like it is over. I am still very young. But I compare myself to my peers and my own family and I see nothing but cowardice and a waste. I want my parents and family to be proud of me so much. But I know this is unlikely. In addition to the lack of accomplishments, I am bisexual and my conservative parents (as mentioned above) would never accept me if they knew. I hate having to hide myself and I know if they ever found out they would tell me I am confused and a faker and a liar. Or, they would get rid of me completely.I am so afraid of the future and I am so afraid because I am going to have to reach it alone. I do not have any friends or family. The only person who has ever been proud of me is my fencing coach, but I do not know what he sees in me. I hate showing my face around our academy because I am so afraid of disappointing him. But I am always going to, because I am never going to be a good athlete. I do not know what to do anymore. But thank you for reading. I am hurting my future because I am a coward.",

It started with a 5k loss that I could not let go of and now has ballooned to more than 90k+ the equivalent of more than 2 years of my salary. Had I invested in index funds I would have made 90k+ instead of the loss. The amount of money we lost and lost out on is staggering. While the vast majority of people made a killing last year not only did i not get any gains I lost so much in the greatest bull market in history. I just saw a report saying that the average wealth of Canadian households has ballooned to over 1 million whereas our family is left with almost nothing. it hurts so much more knowing I lost so much while everyone else got so rich. I know i was stupid in continuing to short but how does the s&amp;p500 go up more than 80% during a worldwide pandemic is beyond me. So not only are we pretty much all out of savings, the massive inflation we have currently has caused our monthly expenses to almost double. The amount of guilt is overwhelming, i single handedly ruined our financial future for at least the next decade and my parents have to bear the brunt of the consequences of my actions. They could have been retired by now but now have to work at least a few additional years due to my fuck ups. A once in a life time opportunity to increase our wealth and what do i do? I fucking lost 90% of our current savings. it is so hard to go on but I have to stay, cannot just off myself after losing all our family's money.

I sometimes think about this and feel like there is no point now for me to be here, to stay strongIm not very good looking, at least it definitely appears that way- I have only ever been rejected or let down nicely, and on top of that I get shy around girls I like and I am awkward.I have only ever been average or below at everything, I am not popular or anything, so I do not rlly get invited to like parties or anything , which especially sucks bc its summer- and I usually have to be the one to set up hang outs with my 2-3 friends The only thing really keeping me going is that my 16th birthday is in November and I do not want to miss thatGiven all this, I feel like sometimes I do not want to be here anymore, and that things could never get better and all I really ask for is for someone to tell me its going to be ok or tell me I am wrong in my thinking with reasoning, please?

I have no solid friends, and have many broken relationships. I chalk it up to anxiety/akwardness when around others- but my initial thoughtis that I am unlovable or a bother. I assum I am unlikable, therfore I most likely manifest those beliefs into reality. I feel stuck. And I feel like an imposter because my career is focused in mental health. Perhaps because I have been doing the same thing day after day for so long? No outside hobbies? Little drive to interact with others as it exhausts me? I do not have a plan or a strong desire to end my life. But I sure as hell think about it a lot. And that alone, is exhausting in itself. Ideations",

So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

I have a long standing history of depression &amp; trauma however over the years I have bounced back and become quite happy and high functioning. Over the past 7 months my mental health has significantly declined and everything in my life has just gone sideways. Firstly I was given a very harsh wake up call about the career I thought I wanted and almost had my graduation delayed - something that kickstarted an entire depressive state &amp; identity crisis for me. I cannot put the mental turmoil this put me through into words. Since then I have broken up with my partner of 5 years after realising I did not love him anymore &amp; meeting someone else. I just finished 11 weeks of unpaid work for my degree and have just found out yesterday that I need to repeat 6 of them and now I am going to graduate late. This was meant to be a huge achievement for me, finishing all my clinical hours for my degree now its been taken away from me for the second time this year as I required some days off for my mental health and they cannot pass me on the amount of hours I have done and they cannot leave the hours in finalised so I have to repeat entirely. All of my friends will be finishing the degree without me, and my ego and pride is too strong I am just so embarrassed by this. Its devastating me. I am on thin ice with my employer and about to lose my job because of how unreliable I have been and they can tell I have had a behaviour change and totally withdrawn. I keep having flashbacks of childhood abuse and cannot sleep at night. I feel numb and empty inside and like I am stuck and everyone else is moving around me. I have been disassociating from reality and losing hours and days and weeks worth of time. I do not know where the last few months have gone. To top it off Two nights ago I was walking back to my car when I was grabbed and forced behind a wall and had my head smashed against bricks a few times and I was sexually assaulted. I am replaying this over in my head and do not know how to voice the way I feel about this. I feel fucking disgusting. I feel so alone and like nobody understands this. I am really struggling to cope with life and I am just sitting in bed wishing I could go to sleep and never wake up.

        "input": "For context. I am a young adult under 25. I choose not to disclose my age because I am paranoid that this might come across someone I know. And let us call my boyfriend M. M and I have been together for around a little over a year now. The story I will tell you happened either at the very first month of our relationship or before we were even official. So for context. At january 2020 (before I knew M) I went on to omegle to chat with strangers. Specifically sext with them. Admittedly in my mind I always viewd sexting as watching porn. Especially if it is with a stranger, it is like watching a cam show. But everytime I did it I felt awful and guilty afterwards, just like with porn. I only did this two-three times. Here comes M. I liked him a lot, but with covid and whatnot we could not meet properly. As I am writing this I am going through a stressful period in my life, and I wish this memory was the only unpleasant one to arrise. But this is the one that shocked me the most. As I lay in my bed, in the middle of a panic attack a few weeks ago my brain suddenly had the thought \"you are a cheater\" and I thought back \"no I am not! I would never cheat on M\". And then my brain thought \"Yeah you are, remember the last time you sexted how guilty you felt for M?\". I was mortified. I had completely forgotten about the last time I sexted.I went on omegle and found a random stranger with whom we sexted. At the time my mind was still thinking of sexting like watching porn. But then something clicked. When I send a breast pic back I realised, what the hell, this is an actual person on the other screen. So I deleted that picture, my account and completely left the sexting game. As I destroyed my account, along with it were destroyed any evidence of WHEN this event took place. After searching I have come to two possible scenarios. It happened in march when we just knew each other or it happened in october (which I doubt it because October was was warmer than March and I was wearing very fuzzy clothes). Now after this thought came to my head, my brain cannot let it go. it is been three weeks since it came back up and my brain is always telling me \"you are a cheater, kill yourself, you hurt M, your family will find out and kick you out of your house, M will publicly humiliate you and your friends are going to leave you, you will be homeless and alone as you deserve\". I am going to see a therapist in a month or so, but I do not know if I can hold on till then. I have no friends who I consider friends, just friendly people, so no support system. I worry that if I break up with my bf I will be completely alone and I will go back to self harm or I will kill myself. I cannot live with myself. And the think is, say I tell this to bf and he breaks up with me. What if the event did happen in March when we first knew one another? At the end of the day, I am confused and scared, I do not want to be a bad person. I do not. I do not want to feel like if this happened in october I should kill myself as punishment. It just, it feels like I should genuinely physically harm myself if I did this, I cannot believe how dissapointed I am in me. To think I would destroy the best thing that ever happened in my life.

        "input": "I am very sick and tired, both mentally and physically. I have been struggling with a lot of physical health issues for my whole life, and I have been struggling with mental health issues for the past 6-7 years, I am so tired of having to deal with both problems, as my physical health makes my mental health worse and the stress from my mental health is likely just making my conditions worse, its a never ending cycle and I rarely feel good, ever. I have been struggling with severe asthma for my whole life, which is fine on its own, but its at the point where I have a hard time doing much exercise, and I can no longer cope with weather changes, so every time it rains a lot of it becomes a bit more dry than normal I find myself heaving for air and coughing up blood. I am writing this right after contemplating taking my own life and coughing up more blood into my sink. My asthma is not all, I have a lot of trouble eating food, I randomly get very sick after eating and I cannot seem to link it to any specific type of food, so almost every day after eating a meal I am in pain for hours. I have a hard time sleeping, I have barely gotten any sleep the last few months, and when I do sleep I sleep almost the whole day, and I cannot get out of bed to do anything, its very frustrating. As for my mental health, I have not been able to seek any professional health for a lot of reasons, so whatever I say about my mental health is not diagnosed, but all I know is that I NEED to see a professional soon, I cannot handle my own thoughts anymore and it sucks. I have been struggling with really severe depression since I was about 11-ish, and the earliest suicide attempt I can remember was over the summer after I had completed 6th grade, I had not been eating for a few days and I was just extremely sad. I have had a few attempts before, usually I am too tired or scared to fully go through with it, which sometimes when I am having a good day I feel grateful for not going through with, but usually I just remember my past attempts and feel an overwhelming urge to try again. I also have really extreme anxiety, and it is exhausting. My anxiety is just crippling me and it kind of rules my life to a large degree, as I do not ever get close to many people, and I am too scared to just act how I want to act around peers and even friends. Speaking of, I do not ever speak to any of my friends outside of when I am physically around them, and I never see them on my own time simply because I have no energy to see anyone and I do not live near most of my friends, which is sad since I only have like a handful of people I would call friends, and I am not close to them by any means beyond friendly engagements. My experience with schooling also makes me extremely depressed constantly. When I was in middle school a few years back I was constantly bullied for a lot of things: my poor social skills, being nerdy and kind of awkward, being annoying, and acting \"like a fag\" (this particularly hurts now because I am gay). I would get my books thrown at me, people punched me and once there was a boy about twice my size who made remarks that he was going to rape and beat me up in the school bathroom, and then followed me around the school with his friends. I tried to do sports, I played football (my dad wanted me to try it out, I never liked sports at all anyways) and this made my have a mental breakdown every day we had a game, and when it was not game day, people would bully me in the locker room. The boy that threatened to hurt me in the school bathroom got paired with me to practice tackle drills, and instead of doing it how we were instructed, he would pick me up and slam me into the ground repeatedly, which was not how our coach told us to do it, and it hurt my back and made me shake and cry after practice. In high school, I joined the swim team, as I loved swimming and I was actually very good at it, and on top of that it was the only sport I was able to do without worsening my asthma, which was great. But the massive pressure I had on me to do well in an extremely competitive swim team made me constantly anxious, and I cannot even enjoy going to the pool anymore. I got picked on by my swim mates as well, because I was not very well socially adjusted, and I would get insulted in the locker room for being a little weird. Our soon to become team captain was kind to me and told me not to listen to them after school, but that really did not help much. My family is not really much better: my dad is never home so I do not even know him as much as I wish I could. My biological dad is somewhere in Europe, and he stopped even trying to talk to me anymore when I was 10 years old. My adopted dad is alright, but he is kind of cold and does not really show affection in a way that I understand, although I know he cares for me. My mom had a bad childhood, so she has a lot of problems that I have to step around constantly. I ask them to take me to a professional of some sort, and up until a few months ago they would just play down my mental issues and coupled with my really bad anxiety I was too anxious to actually say anything. I started telling them I had very frequent suicidal thoughts, and this I think really scared both my mom and dad and so they kind of lashed out, I do not think they know what to do. My dad told me that killing myself would be a selfish thing and I just told him to fuck off if that is what he wants to tell me, and my mom told me she would get me help but always is too busy/forgets to schedule me an appointment. I feel like I am trapped in a box and I am invisible to my own family most of the time. A few years ago I started having obtrusive thoughts that ranged from random urges to harm myself, many of which I acted on, to thoughts that my family secretly hates me. This past year was awful for me. I am an at risk group for Covid and the whole pandemic thing just took a massive toll on my already declining mental health. Being in my house was not bad for me thankfully, I am kind of used to being alone, but the frankly idiotic and terrible response to it by my local and national government made me a lot more nihilistic than I already was. I had a heavy school workload, I have always been considered \"gifted\" so most of my classes are pretty intensive and doing them online was terrible. I sacrificed my sleep for A's and B's and my dad still was not satisfied, which made our relationship even worse as I was so tired I just told him to shut up. My parents argue a lot as well, sometimes my dad yells at me for no reason and my mom yells at my dad, and it is almost constant. I have also lost faith in my parents being competent role caretakers in any way. They argue like children, and its almost always over me as well. I already lost one dad and I do not want to lose another, I wish I could fucking die in an accident so my family could stop having to argue, or pay for my medical treatment. I have little to no energy to do anything that could take my mind off of my problems either, I just lay in bed all day and zone out while watching YT videos that I do not really want to watch anyways. I am also worried my teachers think I am \"special\" or something, I cannot really engage in social situations that well and I think I might have autism, as some of my relatives have it and it would kind of explain my lack of social function. But my parents will not take me to see anyone anyways, so why should I even care? Sometimes I wonder if I am being neglected by family, I would consult my counselor but my anxiety stops me from really speaking to anyone about it because I am scared it will turn out my parents are abusing me mentally and I do not think they are bad people, they just have a lot of their own issues and they are frankly just silly people in their own right. I do not know what to do, I am kind of hoping that my health issues will just kill me already, I do not think I am going to get any better, my asthma is only getting worse to the point that my doctors are assessing if my lungs even work properly at all, and I also might need to get the inside of my stomach looked at because my doctors could not find out why my body freaks out whenever I eat, which scares me. I do not know if I am going to live a long life, and all I want is to have my problems go away. I hate where I live as well, I cannot stand it at all, and I cannot move currently due to a multitude of reasons. I want to just die already because living this way for almost a decade now has just destroyed me as a person, I feel sick inside and I have no one to really talk to about it, I have some online friends who are very kind to me, but I get panic attacks and I feel extremely ill whenever I open up about my issues to someone I know. I do not know what to do, I keep remembering instances where I attempted suicide and its overwhelming me all the time. I cannot even use sleep as an escape. I hate my life. I am sick and tired",

I am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then I think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies,..and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a SHIT. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, I do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact I think it is normal *not* to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the SSRI (generic lexapro) I already knew and felt this, but was SO overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult ADHD life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the SSRI (in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd ), which I was resisting for a long time. always been anti-meds but LITERALLY could not STAND carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my \"natural healing\" beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the SSRI, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. I am very clear and calm about it now. I am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once I get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, I can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. I am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, I am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while I love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason I *would not* voluntarily leave this earth... each of us can only suffer for so long right? am I supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because I do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached I become and drawn towards this plan. and I am not irrational, it is not like I would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like I am planning a vacation or a trip, I feel the same way, that same eagerness or like I have this thing in the distance that I can look forward to. I have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!SO... is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because I have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to WANT to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know I can talk to my or a therapist but I also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the SSRI is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent SSRI, should I be alarmed?",

Was going to kill myself but she convinced me before we split but I did some slashing to my wrist. I have been trying to contact her but she just blocks me and that is got me down bad. My psychiatrist thinks I am a danger to myself and also suggests ketamine therapy but I am scared to be separated from my pc. Idk what to do. I want Alaida back but she hates me and I am scared off hospital. Just want the pain to end tbh My psychiatrist suggests that I go to hospital. What is it like?",

Nothing , i realize that so many people die and died in past we are just very little tiny part of time gap , why we live if there is death and after that nothing , why just do not die at this moment nothing going to change , I even do not take try to hustle for waking up in morning and again go to sleep , I mostly sleep when there is no work or lectures , i am not sucidal but if someone puts gun on my head i will just be happy and smile at that moment Not sucidal but definitely something feel like nihilism",

Never wanted to make a post but here it is anyway because I really want to vent it out without being known.Thought I would make a throwaway account but had no motivation to do so. it is so very difficult. Endless rows of days. If not for my mom, I would have been long gone. She, literally, is the only reason why I am still around. And she has not been doing great, health wise. I am a sore loser. Got no friends or people I could talk to or expect any emotional support. it is all my fault that things are like that though, besides people are busy with their own life.Tried journaling. It did not work. At. All. When I revisited what I wrote it only justified my thoughts. The thing is I do not want to hurt my mom. we are not exactly a functional family but my parents love me in the way they can. that is more than I could ask for, I guess. Anxiety and being gullible in general made me quit my decent and we will paying job 2.5 years ago. have not been able to get back because I have panic attacks in the interviews. My dad hates me now because I am a loser. I have absolutely nothing to look forward to. I hate facing another day and the day after that....day after day after day....I just do not want to do it anymore. I hate how I like the idea of not existing anymore.",
