that is it. That is so unfortunate and unlucky me. Unfortunately I am still alive.,1
I go to a random parking lot in the Tdot park my benz and Overdose in the backseat tonight would anyone notice? Nah because people only care about you if your at the same status. My so called friends left once I got myself financially good. So I doubt anyone would give a fuck about this bitch. What if,1
I hope at least someone out there is proud of me I finally had a good day,1
Everything seems to be falling apart. I can no longer see the positive.,1
I get so angry and sad all of the time to the point where it does not even feel like I am me. I think about ending it sometimes just because I do not want to bring this on my friends and family. it is not me. But it is becoming me. I have had a migraine for 12hrs and I cannot sleep. It just fucking sucks. I just want to be healthy. I feel like I have a corrupted mind,0
"I am no ones first choice for anything. The only reason I can come up with as to why is that I am just not good enough. I want to die now. I am so tired. Everyone leaves me, I am so lonely. I am always last",1
"I hate life, o really do, whatever i try i every time end up doing the wrong thing...I want to end my life, i have thoughts of this every single day but I am a chicken and I am afraid of physical pain...I am sure I will end up having cancer like my father in his last year of life, while he also wanted to jump out of the window in the hospital and all my father's family side gave the fault on me. 2 years latery my grandfather had the same fate, it is been 6 years since then, i was just a stupid 17 years old guy, my entire school life was a nightmare, bullying and no real friends. For 7 years I have been suffering from nightmares that are recurring every single day, I have engaged on a relationship when I was 19 and i got sexually harassed and forced into sex. I then realized that I liked guys more and been in a relationship for 5 month with a guy I met online and left me after me having a couple of breakdown... All of my projects failed and I now have no money to help my family and I have broke every single friendship that I had so far.The funny thing? This is only a sumI've tried, i really did with my psychiatrist but every single event in my horrible life ended up being a disaster, i have no hope for the future other than dying in my sleepI... do not know what to do anymore... I will gladly gave my years left in this world to whoever wants it.I am exhausted it is all my fault",1
"today i was left home with just my mom and she took the opportunity to confront me and tell me she thinks i might be depressed, and that the rest of my family feels the same way. for some reason I am frustrated though? one would think it would be a relief because it means i can get help, but instead, all i feel is angry. does anyone know why this might be? and how can i actually open up and talk about it because all i did was deny that i have it during the conversation. idk... my mom confronted me",0
"""The two of me""There are symptoms, affects, reasons why,people have been diagnosed as having more than one personality on the fly,One minute I am me, or on the outside I am me, but inside I am so distant,Me here says, acts, truly means one thing in this instant, The hidden thing, person, the being inside of my head,speaks, warns, screams, cries, wants to lie and stay in bed,Me on the outside smiles, laughs, jokes and is the mountain to hold the weight of the others,Inside is all turmoil, storms, tears flow, sadness lies behind the eyes, unlike the heart of mothers,Protectors, compassionate, empathy, sheltering, caring yet emotionally just so full,The inside cannot come out, cannot be seen, cannot be real, yet charges on like a bull, In the way I do, I write my words like rivers flow,my tears, my anger, my hate, my fear, my loneliness, my emptiness, hides but wants to blow,The storm grows and builds and cries and screams in a room that no one can hear,The protector, the comedian, the man who stands in front of you all in the positive cheer,who is the real me, is there meaning, is he important, is he needed,the affection, the outreached hand, the hug that never is enough, the inside never depleted,In the end, this has not been heard, this sits on my desk, or hides in my drawer,no time to cry, no time to be real, no time to be me, just here to be the hero on page four,I am lost, I am losing, I am falling, I have tripped in the mist, Days are dark, days are lonely, days are a cage where I am or I may not be,In the end, there is only one thing I can conclude, there is two of me....

"Just curious if anyone resonates with this. I think this thought so often, but I know I have to work around this world and keep trying. If I die It will hurt so many people. I wish the guilt would go away. I want the thoughts to dissipate. I keep doing the work but no pay off. Depression is my lifelong battle, and I feel my grip coming undone. This world was not made for me.",0
"My brain has stopped helping me. I went from a well known high school James to no job college finished moron. All the masturbation, fantasy, lies have caught up with me. My mother was my only source of stability but after a year of heinous pain by cancer, she was taken away 3 months ago.The failures hang like skeletons over my head. I cannot help myself now, I just cannot. No self motivation. I have dissociated to such a level that I could not recognise myself yesterday morning in mirror. I am not crying but my shoulders are down now. Talking to almost no one now has made me suffer enormous amount of pain everyday. I do not know, I just wanted a normal life but it is gone completely south.Being bullied in college did me no favour. I wish to see some light of happiness someday because now my mind is hell bend on crucifying my existence and I am hopeless now. I have lied to myself so much that my life has been destroyed",0
i just cut myself deep enough to actually see fat and i freaked out for a second. is this what life is going to be like forever? just trying to get deeper and deeper until I am done being? fighting until there is no fight left in me? I am exhausted I am tired,1
"Three years ago I tried to lethally overdose but I fucked up and might try again. I have learned from the mistake that were made. So...I have about 80 alprazolam presses that are most likely 2-3mg of etizolam or some other benzo RC, some Dramamine and some alcohol. I figure I take the dramamine, get pretty drunk and then just start eating. do not start with the nooo don do it shit, heard it all before. Just let me know the likelihood of this working or if I am overlooking something. Round 2.",1
I cannot and do not want to do this bs anymore I wish I had the guts to just fuckin end it already,0
I am turning 24 in a month. What I do for a job is not fulfilling and I keep struggling to not feel hopeless because of this. Its the highest paying job I can get without investing the majority of my time to stressing about work (I dread this. I think its because I do not want to be trapped) I struggle a lot with the idea of losing myself to a job that I feel is not authentic to who I am? I have not spoken to a therapist all year and I just keep putting it off but its what I really need as my moving forward step. I have learned a lot this year about myself in respect to my family - I understand them better. I am finally understanding I do not have to be so stiff when it comes to new situations. I think my mechanism to remain unaffected by anything is to move through life passively and I have been avoiding becoming personable in my workplaces previously. I need to talk to a therapist it just feels like starting a whole thing once more. Anything I perceive as stress or as potentially stressful is avoided. I guess I am just stuck and afraid Awake at 4:55am and I cannot believe how life is passing me by,0
i fucking hate myself sooo much I am a terrible person and i mess everything up and i wish everything could just stop,0
"This is not a sad thing I have come to realize. I am not sad about not wanting to exist. I am indifferent. I have no desire to participate in life.I care for nothing I do not care about anything.I am on here because I am not sure what to do about it. I wish I could voluntarily donate my body to science so I could contribute to humanity in some way.I am not cut out for this life and nor do I care to be.Apathy is the only thing I feel. My life holds no meaning or value, and I have made peace with that.I wish there was a simple way to go. If there was, Id be gone long ago. I do not have the desire to exist anymore.",1
"I am posting here because I do not know what to do. my mother said she plans on killing herself and I do not know what to do, she is refusing help, I think because she said something she does not want to but I am not sure what to do, I have been spending more time with her and that seems to be helping a little but I still need help. I need help",1
"I suffer from dyscalculia, math dyslexia and my family knows I do.My family signed me up for a Grade 10 summer school class, they said it will help my math and writing and I feel like it is just getting worse as my work piles up and they are too hard to do I cry because of stress and I am trying to not cry right now as I am writing this in class.I asked them to sign me up for an ART, class. But they refused and they bribed me with new clothes....I hate this I feel worthless and when I tell them it is too hard they say ""it is so easy how do not you understand!"" I try to get help from my teacher but her explanations do not make sense, and on top of that I have severe ADHD and cannot focus on shit. I am getting assigned to write like 5 paragraph assignments every class and I struggle with writing and I literally have to use Grammarly and it is so frustrating. I feel dumb and like an outcast, I have 2 weeks left and no one understands me......... I am very depressed right now and sturggling.",0
"On another sub, I had a convo with someone in a really bad place with depression, but they do not have insurance and cannot afford counseling.

"So me and my friends were planning to go to a small concert together which i was rly excited about because i barely have any friends and nothing exciting happens in my life so of course i was psyched. Anyway she texted me and i did not answer for a week because i was not really on my phone and feeling like shit ( the text was unrelated to the concert), and today she texted saying she is going with another friend bc she thought i could not go because i did not answer the text. I do not know, i guess its on me. It feels like i always fuck up any good opportunity in my life and then I am usually alone. Nobody really cares. It sucks I feel so alone",0
"Life is fcking crazy, I want everyone to realize how sad and weird life can get. I have been struggling deeply for the longest. To be honest I do not know why I am still going but I am hoping one day I can look back and be glad that I am still breathing. Everyday feels the same. I am constantly thinking about suicide but Ill probably never do it. Its a really sad feeling when you have no one to turn to. I am so scared of the future and where Ill be. Am I destined to be alone forever?? I have always thought it was cringe how people just rant on Reddit but here I am on Reddit. I hope I can look back on this post and remember these times.

Hello I been really struggling with depression recently and I am currently not able to get professional help. I am in a good place physically. I got a job at Yellowstone National park and my job comes with room and board so I was able to move out of an abusive living situation and I have good plans for after my contract here is done.

"Hi. This is my first time posting on reddit or just any community. My therapist told me I have depression so I am posting it here sorry I do not know where else to just VENT so I hope I can vent here and talk gibberish. Maybe that will help? I am in my late 20s and I am currently taking care of my mentally disabled family member but I think my other family member is soon going to take over that so no more responsibility yay! The thing is though, I am just ... so tired. So so tired. I want to take a break. I do not know how to. I am scared to take a break but even if I was not scared, I do not know how to. I have never really had any hobbies. I have never traveled. I have never done anything other than ...working and taking care of my family member. I have never had anyone to share something. Petty side of me blames on having my mentally disabled family by my side 24/7 but nah I am just too much of a coward to try. Like everyone suffers but why am I making a huge deal out of it? What are some things that you recommend when you absolutely have no idea what to do? Like where and how do I begin? How do I walk out of my house and be me? But the other part of me is like, well should I even try? Who knows if this chapter of my life is going to be painful than my previous one? Will my family have to be responsible for my debts (Idk like my $1500 care credit bill lol). I mean I just paid off almost everything I owe but my school debt is like ... I still got long way to go. It depressed me even more because I cannot even be selfish enough to end this because I feel bad for my family HAHA Like what am I? Oh GOSH I am so tired. Help",0
"Like I am not suicidal but I sometimes rly fucking hate existing, and in these moments I think about how everyone would feel bad for not giving a shit about me. And I know that it is very selfish of me but I will not actually kms so its fine.also I feel like I am not sad enough to be depressed, bc I know I will not actually physically hurt myself. Idk I just wanted to get it off my chest. Sometime I wish I could just kms so ppl knew I was hurting",0

"I just started a job in customer service. Working from home, fortunately. I have been unemployed most of this year and I have been a financial burden on my boyfriend. This sweet man even offered to get a second job so I would not have to work. But I could not do that to him. I want to be better. it is just so hard. My training ended last week and today I am going into calls. To add to the stress and anxiety, my training was not very good. I have no idea what I am doing. I have panic attacks and cry every day and going into calls is going to make it worse. I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts but today is one of the worst days. I cannot sleep. I can only think about how much I want to die. I keep thinking if I just end it now, I do not have to deal with work. It would be so much easier. The only thing that is been keeping me grounded this year is my dog, and she only does so much to keep me level-headed. I want to quit. I do not want to go in. I really think this job will kill me. I cannot even afford therapy. And I will not get insurance until my 60 day mark. What should I do? I quit my last job (also customer service) because it was wearing on my mental health and I could not handle it anymore. I just want to be happy. But one second I am totally fine. I have come to terms with this and I have convinced myself it will be okay. The next I am a bawling mess and having a panic attack and wanting to end it all. People always say ""it gets better"" but that is such a load of bull. My life has consistently been shit. I do not need to love my job. I just do not want to hate it this much. I do not want it to destroy me. I cannot get the help I desperately need and I am not alright. Has anyone else been in this situation? Did anything help? What did you do? Because I am more alone and lost than I have ever felt in my life and I am trying to find any excuse to hit the exit button. But maybe it is just better that way. New job in customer service and I have SAD. Great.",1

"Its all I feel lately. About everything. Myself. My life.My job. My looks. My weight. My jealousy. Fucking everything. Every day I wake up, immediately seething at the thought of slogging through another worthless day. I have always had a short temper, but lately every single minor inconvenience sends me into an absolute blind rage. I want to break things. I want to destroy anything in my immediate vicinity just to quell my immense anger. I cannot fucking stand it anymore. I cannot even sleep right now because of how angry I am. How did my life get to this point? What happened to the innocent, wacky goof of a kid I was? What happened to my family. I used to love them. I cannot feel love anymore. I do not love anymore. I remember waking up on a Christmas Day, my mom, dad and sister all gathered around the tree. My dad was always the last to wake up. I could not ever really sleep back then. I remember staying by the tree all night, shaking the presents, trying to figure out what It was. Sometimes I would scratch a little bit of the wrapping off of the bottom of the present, then peek inside to try and see what it was. I am sorry mom. Sorry for being an ungrateful, worthless piece of fucking shit, ever since I was a kid. I am sorry you bore me. Pure Hatred.",1
"Half vent, half a genuine question. How would one learn to make a routine to function semi-normally? I have recently overcome one of my most severe depressive episodes, but I feel myself falling back in. I do not know how to function normally. I have tried adding things one by one and scheduling timers for every step of a morning routine but I do not get how people can actually have time in a day to do everything they want. How do people find a balance? I need to get up at around 5:30 in the morning, but I have been falling asleep at 5am for years. I do not know how I can fit brushing my teeth and washing my face and showering and eating and working out and f\*cking everything else into a 1.5 hour period before I have to leave. And once I get home, how do I balance schoolwork and my social life? How do I develop a night routine? Functioning normally is overwhelming. I have 2 weeks to learn how to do it and I feel like the stress is going to set me back further than I already am. How do people make time for everything in a day?",0

I made the mistake of telling people online I was planning on killing myself. The truth is no one truly cares. I will not leave a note. I will not even reveal how I am feeling to anyone. I will just end it. Everyone says the same thing when you reveal to them how you feel. I understand they do not want me to die but it is not because they like me. it is because they do not want to feel like they have killed someone. They will do all they can to help because they want to feel good about themselves. If they truly cared about me they would ask me questions about my life. They would ask me my opinion on things. Nothing I think matters to anyone and I am just there to comfort others apparently. I feel ignored half of the time I speak to people. I cannot keep doing this. I think if I go through with it I will not tell anyone,1
I want to give up. I want to die. My life is hopeless,1
"Still live with my parents, still a minor yeah. Not for long though, wish I could cherish my youth for what its worth since I never really got to get out of the house much or have anything closely resembling a healthy functioning friendship. Just overcontrolling and overbearing parents with shit abusive colleagues. Parents left for a business trip, 'bout a week. Two days ago, was melding over my dwindling sanity and the increasing gaps in my memory. I cannot remember shit about any traumatic events I may or may not have had in the past, so it is quite depressing to think that maybe they just never happened in the first place. I have no real reason to be depressed so it is quite likely that I am just doing all of this for the attention. At least that is what I have been told. Cracked out alcohol, since I cannot cry. have not been able to cry for a very long while. Parents used to beat me for crying, colleagues used to beat me as well. School when I was younger was shit, used to get beaten up a lot. Broke my nose twice, a few other bones in my body. Belittled and broken down so fucking much it bled straight through to the point where I had a decent sized portion of my adolescence where I was obsessed with the idea of transitioning to abandon my entire previous personality and set of memories since I could not cope with them anymore. Still fucks me over to this day, and although I might have found a balance for a ""softer guy"" type personality it still does not play well at times. Right, sidetracking. Alcohol. Thought it might help me unbottle some emotion to the point where it overflowed and I might cry again. have not eaten anything proper for months now, usually just half a meal a day, (Think a sandwich, maybe two on a good day), so the alcohol kicked in really quickly. Sisters were going to be back so I counteracted with around 7-8 espressos in a large mug. Looking back that was probably a bad idea. I never got around to crying. Instead, sitting on bathroom tile for hours on end, I just took more and more aspirin with ibuprofen to get around to finally biting the dust. I have been trying for *years* now, it just never really worked out since the probability of a proper death and not just oh-great-i-fucking-survived-and-now-my-parents-are-going to-ship-me-to-a-monastary type lifestyle, but then I just could not give less of a fuck. Necked down 6-7 aspirin and 25 ibuprofen when a really bad habit kicked in. I tend to cut myself. Right around my thigh, so that it is easier to hide. Usually I just cut once twice, never revisiting the same wound but goddamn this time I was persistent. Cut the same area multiple times till I hit the femoral artery. Alcohol, ib, aspirin, and caffeine make for one hell of a whack combo, and then I was bleeding out to death as well. Over the course of the next few hours I proceeded to loose a lot of blood. Funny how the only time I am ever smart and live up to the expectations others have of me is when I am trying to kill myself. I have no idea how much, but I had a really fucking bad fever, tremors, and a few others but I have no idea what happened after I got in bed. Bled through the damn mattress, and the only thing that saved my life was a belt and some salt. Strapped it so tightly around my leg I have no idea why I stopped the bleeding, I do not remember 80% of the shit that happened two days ago, as usual, but the thing that was the scariest was the relentless sense of loneliness. it is why I am here now, two days later. Alone in a dark room, desperately calling every number in the contact book to see if someone will pick up, someone to save me from the same nightmare, but no one is there. I am all alone. I know I deserve it, but it is still scary. After all this time, years on end of loneliness I still cannot get over it. I would say I am a kid at heart but after the things I have done in the past the guilt just will not let go. All I know is that life is fucking scary, man. I apologize for the mega-condensed version of this. Yes this is on a new account, I do not want people in my personal life knowing what the fuck is going on. If I managed to do one thing right, it was hide this whole fucked incident from my sisters and brother-in-law without them guessing what the fuck was going on. I did not touch on some of the finer stuff but I suppose that is to be clarified later. I also know there is a decent chance this will get removed, to which I tell the moderators that it is pretty understandable. Whatever happens typing this out helped me a little at least. Depression, Amnesia and Death, oh my.",0
"It sounds ridiculous -because honestly it is- but I am making a list of pros and cons of taking my life, I am full on serious. I have been struggling with depression for about 5 years now, meds are not that effective either, so the idea of ending it just seems more convincing each passing day. I am both failing and despising my studies (already been held back a year and basically the worst med student you would ever meet), incapable of making relationships or maintaining the old ones, always irritated and impossible to be around. But most importantly I am thinking of doing it for my parents, they have been together for 24 years of absolute hatred and it is just geeting worse recently. They treat me like a third party of their marriage as the oldest daughter which means I am loaded with all their problems while witnessing my dysfunctional family at the same time. My mom always says that if something ever happens to us (her kids) she will finally divorce my father (who absolutely will not do it) and ever since I have been calculating the results. I mean it is kind of of a win for all of us, I will rest, mom will finally get her divorce, my siblings will live for once in a healthy environment, and father will go his own way .. they would be sad for a while i guess, but really that is the only bad side to it. Its a win for everyone. If the pros overcome the cons, is it worth it ?",1

"About a year ago, I finally came to terms with ending it all. My final trigger will be the loss of my job. I was told 2 years ago that I will lose my job, but they keep stringing us along. Its coming soon. I have cleaned out most of my house except for the essential creature comforts, it will be easy for someone to finish cleaning up. I plan to leave as little mess or trouble behind as possible. I am 38, and have been alone nearly my entire life. I have everything but love and affection. A very good paying job(for now) with one of the largest companies in the world, a house, 2 cars. I do not even look at my bank account, I know the money is there. I was born to older parents, they were married 30 years before I was born(last of three) and they hated each other. their relationship was strictly business by the time I came along, never saw affection between them. My sister was 10 years older and she was more like a distant relative. my brother, 5 years older, died in a car accident at 19. My mom died when I was 20. I was never close to my dad or sister, the only remaining family. We tried when my sister had a kid, but spending time with each other was like sitting in a waiting room with strangers. &amp;#x200B;I have always been the loser, the one to be picked on. I have been told since early on that I am ugly and creepy. It goes back early in elementary school when someone told a girl that I liked her and she cried. I spent my entire school career barely surviving panic attacks and anxiety. My parents never taught me how to take care of myself, I was the smelly dirty kid all the way through high school. I did not attend any sort of social gatherings, or even my graduation. No romantic interests from anyone. Some how after high school, I got a girlfriend for about 2 years. Still a dirty kid, I do not know how that happened. She left me, my mom died shortly after, and I started to learn how to groom myself. 15 years of zero romantic interest from anyone, from 20 to 35. about 10 years of that on every dating site, I paid for all the perks and crap. barely anyone will even talk to me. Managed to get a handful(5ish) of first dates over 10 years, never a second. One girl met me in the parking lot of a restaurant for dinner and literally said ""nope"" and 180'd to her car. At 35, I met Laura online, and managed to date for a few months. She was, on paper, everything I ever wanted. There was something wrong, she was just so cold, zero affection. There was some things I knew would lead to a toxic relationship, and I broke up with her. I still feel that was a mistake. That maybe I could have been a better person. She was just sort of immature and, i do not know. She was in her 30's and lived at home with mom/dad, was a teacher at the same high school she went to, she was just like a perpetual 17 year old.anyway, 3 years later. this past holiday, the 4th, was the first time in 3 years that I have seen anyone outside of work. I cannot socialize anymore. everyone is married with kids, I am almost 40 and have spent my entire life alone. I have missed everything, never taken a trip, no weekends away, no amusement parks, no beach, no holidays. How can i do those things without someone to share the experience with, is not that the point? I spend every holiday alone in my house watching TV. I have not celebrated my birthday, probably since my mom died 18 years ago, and that is only because she would bake a cake.I have cleaned out most of my house, I have severed ties with the few coworkers that I kept in touch with after they moved on. I have not talked to what is left of my family in almost 5 years. Soon we will finish the final contracts at work, and I will be let go, and I will finally be free of the pain. Almost to the final precipice",0
"Is anyone else feeling this? I feel like the world was brought down to my level during the pandemic, and I felt pretty good/excelled. Now its the reverse. Nothing from before matters. Its hard to do even a little. I do not trust my former support group because of their actions last year. I am not sure if I am surrounded by and attract toxic people or if I am toxic. Normalcy is a facade, and anyone telling me otherwise is kidding themselves The pandemic was really great for me. Normalcy is not.",0
I have a job make 100K+ a year. I have a girlfriend. I have my own home at 26. On paper I am doing everything correct but I am so sad. I have a month off from my job and I keep trying to force myself to take a trip because I know I will not get an opportunity with this much time off for a long time. The work it takes to plan a trip makes it almost not worth it. it is been 2 years since my childhood dog died and the anniversary is coming up and I miss him so much. I feel so bad because I was going through so much shit when he was sick that I felt like I was not even spending his final days with him the best I could have been. My relationship with my girlfriend was falling a part at the time and I just quit my job because of my depression and I was so focused on myself. He had cancer for 2 years so it was hard to tell when his time was. The whole situation was very traumatic for me especially the day of his death. I do not want to get into details because it was very bad. I still am not even close to getting over it.I have a new girlfriend now and my life is better on paper but I am still just as said. I just want to be a kid again. I have no interest in continue with being an adult. I am so sad every day. The world is so cruel. I miss my dog and just want to be a kid again. Adult life is miserable.,0
"i lost my virginity to my ex, i thought it would make him come back but i was wrong i regret it so much and my whole family knows and everyone makes fun of me for it and they make me feel so worthless. i know what i did was not okay or smart. i just want a break. I have been turning to drugs. I have been harming myself why does not anybody notice? i cannot stop my addiction it just gets worse and worse. why does not anybody care",1
"I was gaslighted my entire life and now I gaslight myself too. My mental health was a mess from as far as I remember. Now I am too afraid to ask for help, because I feel like I do not have a reason, other ppl have worse and I am generally overreacting. Lastly the only thing I want is to die. The words part is that I told my bf about it and I feel like he did not take me seriously. This made my question my feelings even more. And now when I am ready to die I cannot do it. I am to ashamed and I feel like, again, I do not really have a good reason to do so. I dream about it but I cannot bring myself to do it. Nobody knows how to i feel because everybody is neglecting me. I am just so tired I want to go I cannot even kill myself",1
I am m21 my mother passed away 3 days ago she was a single mother my rock a fucking saint I loved her man. Today I loose it at work because a customer tells me I am being very abrupt with her so I snap shouting at her I got fired.

"I was diagnosed with major depression 3 years ago. I have been going to therapy &amp; taking antidepressants for 2.5 years. But my therapist is booking months in advance and I have stopped taking my meds. I can feel it getting bad again. But I am working 5-7 days a week and find myself pretending to be okay in front of everyone. The people I used to confide in about my mental health I no longer tell them things. I am pushing people away and I am watching it happen but I just do not have it in me to fight it. I feel like I am just existing, going to work, coming home and going to bed. I sleep most of the day on my days off because life just seems so loud and its turned down when I am asleep. I do not want to die but Id like to pause my life for a little while. The worst part is; my family does not think I am depressed because I can function. They think that I am working lots and that means I am getting better. My boyfriend got mad at me for sleeping till 2pm on my day off.I feel so alone, which is partly my own fault, but nobody seems to get it. Just because I am not staying in bed for months on end like I used to, does not mean I am not struggling. Being functionally depressed is insane. I feel like I am just existing",0
I need to die. I am a walking nuclear weapon slowing killing everyone around me. I wish I could be put down like sick pets Even though I deserve a painful death. Tonight I am going to drink as much as possible and shove this knife in my arm until I drain this fucking vessel. I ruined everything that is good,1

"I am not sure if I am posting here as a sort of ""I finally reached peace"", or a ""wait, maybe this is actually a bad idea"". I know that killing myself is not the ultimate solution. But the consequences of my actions are so severe, that I cannot and do not want to go through life with them. There is no way out of what I did. (see previous post if curious)I have set a date. I know my method. I have arranged for the deliveries and the place. I am a doctor, like a fully licensed doctor with prescription powers. I have thought of thousands of combinations of medications that could kill me. But I have decided against pills. Too risky. Anyway, I will not discuss the method of my choosing. But I know it is painless. it is all I really want from it. it is not the suffering I want to get away from, it is the reflex of my body to stop that suffering that will stop my progress. This way, I will just fall asleep. I have set a date for my suicide. I feel nothing about it. I feel happy that I will die.",1
"I been feeling depressed since I can remember.The first time I tried to off myself I was 5 years old but ever since I gave birth to my kids I been suppressing this feeling but the thoughts have always been there. This past few months I been dealing with a lot so I been honestly trying to ignore my depression and everything that comes with it. So with that said I went over my in laws to pick up so mail and my MIL and I started to talk and I made a stupid mistake to complain about my husband since I literally have no one and it just kind of happened. Now she thinks I am having an affair and she is mad at me I did not say anything that she does not already know. This made me feel horrible about myself and all the feelings I been suppressing came all at once and my suicidal thoughts are worse, I am not going to do it. My kids are literally the only thing that keep me going but I cried everytime I am alone I have to fight the urges to self harm. I am incredibly lonely and I just want someone to talk to. This has been the hardest week so far",0
"Feels like the an episode of a soap opera, but the title pretty much sums it up.I am 24 now, and started attending university at 18. At 19 I got Pyloric Stenosis which went undiagnosed for nearly 6 months, I lost 49% of my body weight, and due to the impeccable timing, missed both the first year final exams, and the retakes due to illness. During this time my gf of three years broke up with me over Facebook while I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for an MRI, my grandad had a heart failure and died within 12 hours, and a week after leaving hospital for the final time my Mother confesses she was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month prior (she survived luckily).It took two years of feeling sorry for myself to try tinder, and there I met the most amazing person I am now engaged to, they convinced me to go back to University but closer to home as the Uni I was attending had Campuses across the UK.And so I did, and had an incredible time, got to travel to other counties to tour, was lucky enough to work with an artist who I now have work with on Spotify (huge personal victory) and since have released music with the band I am a active member of which was probably the proudest moment of my life. However, I have diagnosed ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression and Anxiety, book smarts just is not my forte, but I usually get by, until a global pandemic happens and I had to do my final year at home in my bedroom, this was my kryptonite, but I was still moving along fine. Up until about an hour ago, my father was taken to hospital by ambulance last Monday, traumatic stuff but we have a family history of being unwell constantly so I managed to not let it drop me getting these final pieces done. He called about an hour ago to tell me they were finally able to get a better understanding of what happened and confirm it is Lung Cancer.I do not know why is was the final straw but I have no idea how to handle this new level of nothingness My Dad just got diagnosed with cancer 22 hours before my final deadline for my degree",0
I am broke but have found money to drink like usual. I do not have a drinking problem I have an escaping from my feelings problem. Sometimes its food or tv or games or my phone. But. The thing is this week is so important. I have several interviews for high paying jobs. I will not be broke anymore. But instead of celebrating I still want to die. I do not want to do this all by myself anymore. I am all alone financially supporting myself my bf my animals. I love them all and I do not want to leave. But they deserve better. I do not know. I am broke lol,1

"Occurring to the doctor I saw I am not fucked in the head enough to seek help...So I started self harming (more than I was), but even that apparently is not good enough.So I am thinking of ODing on the big box of pills I have, cos either way, it is either going to kill me or I somehow survive it and they lock me away where I can get real help.The box has around 100 but I have done research on the type I have and I am not totally convinced that it will kill me, just give me organ failure and great pain, and I are not about that pain I just want the suffering to stop. Why are doctors",1
"I feel like things just keep getting worse. I lost my motivation for everything, I do not speak to anyone anymore and honestly I am just feeling more and more sad and full of anger. it is all because a fucking relationship from 4 years ago, all because of it. I loved her more than anything, she was literally my first real love and then she just.. dumped me. I hate her, I literally hate her but I cannot stop thinking about her. I tried everything, going out, getting in new relationships, drinking, but nothing will work. I just cannot forget about her. I just want her out of my mind, I want to be able to be happy again, because those 4 years were the most painful years of my life. I have felt like giving up so many times and I have cried so many times and I have lost so many friends and I just cannot keep going through this. I went to therapy, and the only thing that helped me for a short time were the pills they gave me. But even those started to lose their effect. So please, tell me, what the hell am I supposed to do? I cannot keep going through this, I am starting to completely break down. I am literally desperate. it is been 4 years and stuff is only getting worse",0

I am now a 37 year old man who is frozen in time, a constant state of teenage arrested development.I have no friends, never had a girlfriend (something I BADLY want) and am incapable of doing work. I live on assistance. Tried every medication and doctor/shrink at my disposal, but considering how extreme my mental illness is, the results have been tepid at best. I am stuck and I want out. I am so, so, so lonely. Every day is hell on earth for me. Please, someone talk to me. I Have Nothing",1
"I was talking to a friend about how I always think it would be great to just never wake up, or be suddenly killed, etc. She was super freaked out and said she did not realize I am suicidal I was trying to explain that I am not going to hurt myself, it would just be cool to not exist anymore, and that is just normal for me.

I keep forgetting things as they happen. Even typing this makes me scared. I am so god damn lost. Iv tried to kill myself 2 times now but to much of a pussy to go though with it. Sometimes i think to myself maybe if i kill myself then people that say they love me will see that I am broken and in constant pain. It feels like no one can hear me. I feel so crazy its killing me I feel like I am insane",0
"Hi, so I have never talked about this friend but oh god, she is something. I asked them to stop calling me the t and f slur, since I am gay and trans and it makes me uncomfortable but they still doI asked them to stop showing me porn/nsfw art of anime characters, they still doI told her to stop using AAVE since she is white as semen but still says itHas sexualized my age regression, which btw the reason why I regress is because of getting sexually assaulted Whenever I tell them to not do something I do not like she would have a break down and say how they are having a panic attack and how they are sorry, then proceed to do it all over again Awhile back, I was worried about me and my boyfriends relationshipand him being aro (I finally brought it up, saying how I am not comfortable being in a relationship if hes aro, turns out he understands. He is not aro, and we moved on and did not even get in a fight. Feels so good to get that off my shoulders) so I vented about it to my friend, big mistake! They said the following *boyfriends name* is toxic, manipulative, abusive and so much more you need to leave him!! No hes not? Hes literally the sweetest boy ever, nobody has ever treated me good, not even my friend (the one I am talking about)I did not believe any shit she said, I went to sleep, left their house immediately and cried. I cried a lot. Hearing people say shit like that about your boyfriend is not something that is fun!So less than a month later I told him, and he was so hurt. He has lots of horrible intrusive thoughts just like I do, and now she made him feel like they true. I feel awful, my poor fucking boyfriend. I want to comfort him and hug him and do everything in my power to protect him but we are long distance rn and I cannot do shit. He still feels shitty about it, and I do too. My so called friend has said lots of other awful things, Ill talk about those later My friend hurt my boyfriend and me",1

"As much as I want to write out an essay on all the things pushing me over the edge, I will not go too in detail since I know no one would read all of it anyways.My last post was 4 months ago, and I was having an episode that I thought would end in suicide. A lot has happened since then.For a concrete and direct answer, long story short, the main accelerant for this is envy. An impossibly strong, vile envy. Nothing will stop it. there is no exaggeration when I say it is been on my mind 24/7 since last August. Constant thoughts of all I could have been have perpetually haunted me for almost a year now, and combined with everything else going on with me, it beat me. I lose, I give up.And if you are curious, what I wanted to do was art, and my envy is for an artist. I even got a drawing tablet just to feel what it is like to drag a stylus on a screen, but that is it. it is not going to go anywhere.All that is left is for me to build up the courage to take my life. And all I am hoping when I cross over to the other side, is that perhaps there is a good reason I went through this life.Hopefully this is the last I post on this account, I am posting this mainly as closure to my obnoxious story. It was a rough journey and ultimately I lost. All I fear now is failing my suicide. So wish me luck. My story ended a while ago.",1
"I do not even know what I should do anymore. I just want something to happen that would wipe me off this world. I thought getting my dream job would make me happy, I was just naive. I achieved that goal and I feel absolutely nothing. I have no other goal now. My one thing that I had to go on means nothing to me now. How stupid and foolish of me to think it would solve my suicidal ideation. I cannot imagine my life without it honestly. I really cannot imagine what life would be like without looking at every object and situation and think of all the ways it could kill me, its been my whole life and I wish I was joking. I just want a way to go away without hurting anyone but how ridiculous and egotistical of me to even think my absence would hurt anyone. I am so done...I have a lot that many wish for, I am privileged and very lucky but yet I every moment I just want to kill myself. How ridiculous. At the end of it all",1
"So the other day I kind of had a breakdown when no one was home, a severe one that I was not sure I would survive. This has not happened to me in years. But now today, my situation got even worse, and everything seems so hopeless that I cannot feel anymore. I need to cry but I cannot, I want to be happy but I cannot. I even tried to masturbate the past couple of days but it is like my brain is devoid of all and any serotonin.So now, I am kind of stuck in a drifting state where I am just completely tuning out my emotions until it is safe to feel them again. Honestly not sure if I am a sociopath because surely this is not normal. Usually I would try to feel sad anyway or make myself feel really down like I deserve it, but that does not really help anything so I just choose nothing today. I do not want to fight feeling nothing today as much as I would rather have emotions but after my breakdown and what I almost did, I do not feel like it is safe.Anyways, I thought I was getting to a point where I was finally emotionally healthy but everything came crashing down within a couple of days. I just feel concerned for myself for the future because this numb thing only happens when I am at the very lowest of my depression and cannot take it anymore. I would not wish it on anyone. I feel like I am missing out on life because I cannot feel right now. I cannot do anything right now. Hoping maybe someone with the same problem can help when this wears off and I get to the scary part again. Thanks. Choosing nothing today",1
I have the want to die but I am too afraid of jumping or anything that might leave me still living.. I wish assisted suicide was a choice for everyone.. This life is hard. Everything costs money and no one gives a fuck about you. I am tired of dealing with my problems and nothing getting better. I want to stop being scared an just do it. Too afraid to commit,1
I am sick of their stupidity and the people that take advantage of them. They have ruined my life since I was born. They always made choices against me that is why I ended up marrying an abuser and becoming depressed. All they are good at is catering to assholes that do not even respect them. I wish I was never born to these people. I am sick of my parents and the people that use them.,0
"Eve though my Ex was toxic, she did not use to be like that, before. Only after she became friends with a fucking asshole of a person. That friend of hers has a long history of destroying relationships, it is not even funny.Still, after a long time since she broke up me and ghosted me (February 18th), I am still feeling like shit, every single day.I just woke up from a dream with her, in which she loved me again. This is just fucking depressing. I am getting dreams with her, every fucking single day.Knowing that I will not find someone like her anymore, just makes me want to kill myself. I know that ""there are many fish in the sea"", but I do not know how true it is, not like her. She had the same personality as me, with so many things in common, that it just breaks my heart. That day, not only did I lose my girlfriend, but I lost my best friend (or at least, one of them).People used to say that we were meant to be together, we were really alike. We had the same lobbies, the same comedy stile, the same fucking everything. THERE WILL NOT BE ANYONE LIKE HER. We loved each other to the maximum. Ever since she left me, I have been so badly hurt, that I cannot cope with the fact that she left me, after months.I have been thinking of suicide, for almost every day. I just cannot keep up with this pain. It is even worse, to go out and see homeless people, I just feel so ungrateful, that I feel even worse. I am so pathetic, that if she asked me to go back with her, I would say yes. The realization that I will never find someone like my ex, just breaks me.",0

"Apologies for length. there is a *lot* to explain and I just.. need to vent, need a hug, and need someone to tell me things will be okay.I miss my friends ***so*** much.I met them a few years ago, when we started spending every Wednesday night at each others' places, seeing each others' faces, laughing, drinking, just.. basking in each others' warmth. And they made me feel that I was understood. That I finally had a space with them to be myself. They made me feel like I was *worth* something. Starting March of last year, we had to stop getting together for the then-foreseeable future, for obvious reasons. We still talked to each other every Weds night with voice chat, played games with each other, all of that. We did not stop being friends. Honestly, I do not know what shape I or they would be in if we had not had that solution. It was the best anyone could have done.But.. well.I do not.. love myself very much. Hardly at all, really.it is genetics. I have major depression and anxiety from my mom and dad. I have ASD (formerly Asperger's). And I have been told by my family that even very early on, I was withdrawn from and overwhelmed by the world. I had trouble trying to accomplish things, because I was convinced it would only end in failure.it is also trauma. My mother ran away from the family for a month or two when I was a toddler. Her emotions were unstable and I had to learn to walk on eggshells and preempt her anger or disappointment by treating her well. My dad struggled with alcoholism (though does not anymore) and got in accidents. My parents had lots of shouting matches. I was molested by two separate neighbors when I was 7 or 8. At 14 I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes after struggling with nausea, headaches, and spontaneous bedwetting (which certainly did not help my middle-schooler dignity) for months. Shortly after that diagnosis, my parents divorced. For years after, I had to act as their intermediary, which was extremely stressful since I feared both of them for different reasons. And so on. And so on. ^((For the record, my relationship with both of my parents is much,) *^(much)* ^(better today. they have owned up to their mistakes and are better people now.))I think all of that has taught me that I am not worth loving. That others matter more. That I am best served by making others happy.When my friends and I had to stop seeing each other, I did not lose them. But.. I think I did lose some parts of those relationships -- faces to read, positions relative to one another in physical space -- that provided me with a sense of worthiness and validation that I otherwise.. was not capable of providing myself.Over the course of Covid, we continued to have voice chats and play games together on Wednesday nights. But I began to act differently. I started going on about how lonely I was. Even right after those nights, on my private twt account (which they all followed), I made those sorts of comments. About how sad and hopeless I was. Almost as if I were accusing them of not doing enough, when in reality we were doing all we could and all we would ever agreed to do.When I saw them sometimes get together online without me, I reacted in similar ways. Even though some of them had been friends before I ever entered the picture. Even though their hanging out outside of the group's Wednesdays had nothing to do with excluding me and everything to do with them being good friends with each other.Throughout all of this, I was feeling down about my job. I would been there for more than six years, but my pay had hardly gotten any higher, and Covid reduced the in-office staff (which I was a part of) to a skeleton crew. I hardly spoke a word to anyone over the course of a day anymore, because there just were not many people to speak words to. I was losing motivation and hope.In April of this year, I applied for a new job that paid better and looked doable, and received a response and interview very quickly. This should have been a red flag, but I ended up accepting the role and giving my two weeks' notice.The week I was to start this new job, I had two more days at the old position to train my replacement. But.. I would never trained anyone before. And we did not have any training resources to speak of. And the senior staff were still almost never in. And my coworker very plainly stated that they did not want to help with the training. And after two hours with the new hire, I would exhausted what little I would been able to prepare. And I excused myself to the bathroom. And I excused myself from the building. And I had a panic attack up the car garage elevator. And I went home and tried to sleep and tried to ignore my phone and continued to panic.And then I started in the new job. And while I understood the role to be clerical, the first half of the day was warehouse work. And I was horrified that I would been placed in the wrong position. The second half of the day, once the financial controller was able to get away from their desk, was indeed training on the clerical role. But it was so nuanced, and touched on so many points so randomly.. and the building was scary, clearly built for a staff of a couple dozen but currently hosting only four, including the owner..For a week this carried on, and I panicked and had sobbing fits and thoughts of self-harm / s\*\*c\*de every single night. I would never experienced anything like it before.After that week, and after discussing it with friends and family.. I resigned. It was just affecting me so dramatically that continuing on was not an option.While this was going on, I asked my friends for support and advice, which they graciously gave me. But I was also.. up at odd hours, especially once I would resigned, continuing to panic. And I poked at my friends. Asked them for more attention and support than they would already given. More than they could reasonably give. I gave them stupid little updates on my state of mind. It was the sort of behavior I would been engaging in with them for a while now, amped up to 200.And it broke. And they told me how I was being. That I was triggering them with my behavior. That I was piling way, way too much onto them.And I felt awful. I would never meant to hurt them. They mattered so, so much to me, and I was being shitty. Emotionally manipulative. I think I loved myself so little that I was trying to get *all* of my validation and comfort from them, especially at my most desperate.. and a person cannot give that much to you. it is not physically or emotionally possible. So.. I spoke to them in voice chat. Apologized. They took my apology, and asked me to move on and be better.So. that is what I have been doing. I started therapy. Started learning to be more self-reliant. To love myself more, because I wanted to be a better friend, and because in the times I would not be able to receive love from them, I would be able to get it from *some*where. To not doubt myself so much. And, by extension, to not doubt my friends (and how their behavior was or was not connected to me / my self-worth) so much. To fight against intrusive thoughts of my worthlessness. To be my own friend.I have had some success. I have made some steps. I am proud of what I have accomplished, even if it is only been a short while. I am definitely in a better place than I was two or three months ago.But.I still miss my friends' faces and places and laughing and drinking and warmth. Because regardless of my own strength, they give me.. tons more. And because I love them and their personalities and just being with them and sharing with them.And recently two of them said they are going to be so busy these next two weeks that they will not even be able to voice chat like normal, and. I am just scared and lonely.And my birthday's at the end of the month, and I am worried I will be spending it alone. They all have spouses, but all I have got is me. And while I am more comfortable with that today, it is still.. not much yet. And I.. want to be happy. I want a happy birthday. I have been so sad with very little break for months and months now. I want my friends back. I want to be happy. And maybe it is childish but I just want someone to hug me and tell me it is going to be okay.If you have.. any kind words, or anything, I would really appreciate it. I really am doing better than I was, but that does not mean I do not stumble, and I am struggling right now.Regardless, thank you for reading all of this. Because of my behavior over the past year, it would not be right to bring up every detail of this with my friend group. But I still want someone to see it.Thank you.

"As a brief background, I know I have had depression for many years (I am 21 now) but the last year or so has been constant. I also self h*rm quite regularly (not really badly tho). I know many people suffer worse than me but I feel like I have gotten to the point that I would consider doing something about it to stop it getting really bad. But that terrifies me.I have terrible social anxiety and cannot even tell my mum (she is involved in stuff so it would be hard to discuss things too). But I really want to tell my best friend I have had since primary school. We do not see much of each other anymore since she went to university but she is back home for the summer and I have invited her to a concert and to sleep over at my house after. I think it will be good for me to have some company for once. I trust her 100% and know she would be sympathetic (and maybe she is even had depression too). I just find it so hard to bring things up when I know it could make them feel awkward and I do not want to put a downer on the weekend. But I know if I do not say something now I will never tell anyone. I was thinking of telling her after the concert when we are chatting before going to sleep as you always do on a sleepover. I just do not know how to bring it up or what to say. I do not want it to sound attention seeking either. I am not expecting her to do anything, I just want someone to know. Advice needed about opening up",0
"I just cannot take it anymore, I am clearly addicted to it and reading to all those people make me feel like they all lost their minds even though I am an insane one here. Like, I has been really interested in politics since I was younger, and I am clearly leaning one side (left if I have to say...), but I just cannot get over the fact how there are people on both sides that are just nuts, no one wants to hear each other out on the internet and every comment section where disagreement happens becomes an all-out war, where it is impossible to convince anyone to at least consider other side or just respectfully disagree, no the goal is to absolutely obliterate your ""opponent"". I understand that some opinions perhaps should be socially ostracized, but it came to a level that everyone gets offended even if you try to be as balanced as possible, and if you have no opinion, you admit that you are not informed well enough (because apparently now everyone has a PhD in every field), etc. you becomes everyone is enemy, and it it does not only apply to politics, (as an example) I cannot enjoy anything, ""oh you wanted to eat a cake?"" be sure someone comes and tells you how unhealthy it is, oh you wanted to watch some movie? be sure someone on the internet comes and tells you that there are ""bad values"" in it, or something; I understand what they mean but you cannot live in a constant state of paranoia, where everyone is offended by something. Everything is becoming more exclusive, and every group becomes less and less inclusive. I am not saying that I am not guilty of those things, but I try to comfort myself that I try to be at least a bit self-conscious.It came to this that, when I read/watch anything on the internet that is not some funny innocent video, my mental torment becomes impossible to bear, the only thing I am constantly thinking of is smashing my head on the wall with all my might. News - pleas I hope this world will end soon; Comments - even worse. I am just scrolling, scrolling and scrolling, and with every post scrolled I just loose a tiny bit of my sanity, and when you magnify it by the number of scrolled posts, it becomes apparent that I am completely mentally deranged.And my depression usually, simply, makes me unable to do anything else then scroll this god forsaken web, because I do not really get satisfaction from anything, and this internet stockholm syndrom makes me feel at home with this psychic torture.tl;dr - the internet is just a toxic place that I cannot escape.I do not know if it is even a good place to post it (and I will probably delete it, like I usually do...), but it seems like this subreddit is rather friendly, and I apologize for this rant but I wanted to vent out, maybe find comfort if someone feels the same... The Internet is driving me crazy",0
"Its not fair how I keep trying and nothing works. Its not fair how no ones there for me. Its not fair how I am too much of a coward to kill myself. Its not fair how I cannot get my friends to care about me or talk to me. Its not fair I am crying in the bathroom because I am fucking tired. Its not fair how people are dying right now and I have a life. A meaningless life. Every time I think something is going good, it never does, then I am back here again. I never wanted to be here and its not fair how I get treated like shit by people I value. How I look is not fair. Why cannot anyone be there for me? Give me a damn hug and tell me they love me. Fuck this shit man. No one cares about anyone. I hate it here. Its not fucking fair. I am so tired. I am just so tired of it all. Its not fair",1
"I am less than two months from going to graduate school, and yet I have never been closer to committing suicide. I have the majority of a plan in place and everything. If I make it to grad school, I have two years of that, and then an internship to start my job, which I can do pretty much anywhere in the country. It feels so far away. It feels like it will never happen. Even in high school I told myself to look forward, that college will be better. It was not, I spent my days laying in bed or working. Now I am afraid grad school is going to be the same loneliness and isolation, so much that I am fully prepared to end it before then. Why does life take so long to get started? Why is the ticket to true happiness and self-determination so elusive? Why does the tunnel to happiness keep going endlessly?",1
"So Ill preface the below by telling you I am okay, and sorry for how jumbled or confusing my thoughts may come across.Also the part that refers to being in pain. I suffer from chronic pain and doctors have given up looking for why and are just trying different drug after different drug to try and manage pain while also keeping me lucid enough to function.I am afraid of intimacy, this is two counts.One sexual intimacy, I cannot do it or images doing it because of what happened to me when I was young.Two I have had so many adults (almost all male) betray my trust. I was beaten by my siblings I was neglected by my parents. I feel that I do not let anyone see me the broken boy because its weekness to need others to trust others.Even all history aside friends tell me to let them know if I need anything, in society this mean jack shit. Not because that is peoples intention but because people are busy and self absorbed, you cannot expect a friend to drop everything to be there for you to have the tough convos.All I can think of is I cannot burden these people with my shit, who wants to hear there friend say that they want to kill them selves?That is also the reason I do not kill myself I cannot put people I care about through that trauma.Tonight I felt like killing myself, I am in pain I am loosing the last of my savings. I am addicted to caffeine and food especially the sugary fatty stuff like chocolate.I decided that I would go to the beach and look at the cold front, waves and wind. I wanted to feel something but felt nothing. I then tried another beach and decided last minute to clime a near by hill that had some old war time stairs up to an old lookout that was meant to spot ships during the war.I thought the higher I go the more wind, the better the view and maybe Id feel something.I have seen these stairs before and I know I am unfit and fat (those are truths). I see the stairs and think to myself well Ill either get to the top or Ill die (its the least worse way to hurt or try to kill oneself)I got half way and the tightened chest and heavy breathing/gasping for air that I am familiar with starts and my legs are shaky (there is a musical joke to be made there).I know how to control my breathing by being intentional, which you know you learn is also helpful when trying to escape bad thoughts ( that whole thing about opening the brain back up to deal with stuff instead of the closed brain fight or flight stuff).So I was very distracted, by my chest hurting and breathing being hard. I sat for two seconds looked at what I imagine was a good view, but I could not care and went back down to the car, being intentional about the steps down, knowing my legs are like jelly and brain no work good with less oxygen.By now I do not want to get hurt, I forgot about wanting to die. Once back at home I continued to cough and wheeze for some time. A different pain was refreshing. It was good to be able to have my mind on something else for a change.I am worried about the future, I always kind of am. Except when with friends but you cannot be with friends all the time, they have family and little ones to look after.Its hard to say I know how I am, what is me and what is the distractions I have to avoid being me or recognising myself and how broken I am.With all that what is the future for me, it is probably pain, hopefully wait loss and as long a life as I am allowed. Will I be happy I do not know, Ill have happy moments with friends.With this pain and my limitations what do I do. Is there no more purpose but to bring joy to my friends where I can and try to be a solid male/adult role model for my friends little ones.What do I accept? and what do I try to change?I usually keep these in my note pad and it goes no further but tonight I just feel like I want to be seen, even if its just one person.But this is the internet where jo one is owed anything.

"So basically I was never meant to be born, I was born in the wrong body. Transitioning would be too difficult with all my mental issues but living as a man for the rest of my life is not an option either. So I know I am going to go soon. I have been slowly selling all my belongings so my family does not have to worry about it and I am going to donate my money to a charity and my sister for university. Is it normal to plan like this or do people just commit suicide leaving all their belongings like they would live another day? Planning to die?",1
"I have had a rather chaotic past 2 years, 31/m. Basically drank myself into oblivion and went to rehab but now I am sober. Still fixing my life in multiple facets and am far from a together man. The cliche you have to love yourself before you find a relationship, honestly, probably holds a lot of merit. let us face it, that is just not possible though. I have been alone so long, I have not even hugged a girl in 8 years. This whole loneliness thing is not doing me any favors. I lack confidence to approach women, I have no game, but I still want to try even though I expect many to be repulsed by my personality. I am average looking. Its just gotten to that point where I do not care anymore, were all just monkeys living on a floating rock. I want to at least try to start complimenting women I walk by (that I am attracted to) with stuff like you are so beautiful. Would this be creepy? Honestly I just need to work up the courage to start talking to women and I do not know where to start. I can not tell you how many tears I have cried about my inability to bond with anyone. Can we talk about looking for a girlfriend?",0
Everything has been going so well and then I get this news. I have one granddad left. The rest are dead. My other grandma (her mom) just died 6 months ago.

"I do not want to die, but I fantasize constantly of being shot or getting in a car accident. Part of it is morbid curiosity, but another is hope that being in that state gets rid of all expectations of me. I do not want to die, but I am so tired. I am tired of trying only to disappoint people. I feel like I can charm my way into an opportunity, but once I get it, its only a matter of time before people get fed up with me and my mediocre work. It leaves bosses wondering what happened to that energetic smiling guy from the interview. I do not know where he went either.I do not want to live my life this way. I want to know what I want, which I guess is what everyone else is shooting for too. I envy people who are hospital ridden after an injury",0
"Hi my names Isaac and I am here to tell my story of depression, anxiety and stress. Currently I am 15 years old and these 3 sins somehow disrupted my body it all started through 1 strawberry edible in May 1st and my mom gave me Xanax for me to calm my self down from the edible and it worked because it knocked me out for the whole day. But the next day my left side of my chest was hurting bad and it scared me because it felt like a heart attack and I had a panic attack so I had to go to the hospital I got their they checked me out and my blood pressure was 180/120 but the doctors told me to calm down and gave me a pill and sent me on my way but the day after that my sides was hurting again and I was scared like I was going to have a heart attack again and then I went to the hospital again for the same reason the doctors did an EKG on my heart and they said everything was normal and my blood pressure was little high again I think it was 140 but then they sent me on my way again but If you guys did not know my parents are currently going thru a divorce too so yeah. But couple weeks later my left side of my chest still hurting but wait I start to get lightheaded more afton now and I had also got tested positive for COVID too now that is crazy shit. I got thru COVID and blah blah these symptoms still happening and there making me depressed because it scares me to think I have to live with these symptoms forever and I do not want to and it scares and makes me get depressed with life and i go to the doctors for this and she prescribed me serpentine and suggests I get counseling but I want to know your guys opinions plz lmk this stuff is eating me Alive Help me find my cure",0

"This question sounds real dumb to even myself as I type this on my phone but I just cannot even tell if I am suicidal or not anymore. I remember in middle school both thinking about and feeling like I wanted to die. I managed to live past middle school and now I am just left with only the thoughts of killing myself but not the same deep desire to kill myself. I am not sure if this makes sense but: while I do not want to die, I also do not really care if I am alive. I bet I am still mildly depressed, but I am happier these days. I am going to a therapist fairly regularly. I do not think I will hurt myself, but is this how I build up my desires to die again? I feel stupid for not even knowing how I feel anymore. Am I a suicide risk? How do I know if I am suicidal?",0
"I have been struggling mentally for a while now, It actually got a bit better for some time, but I am now at my lowest. I sleep more than 10 hours each day because living in my dreams is much simpler, once I wake up and remember who I am and the state of my life, I get this dreadful feeling and can burst into tears, which also happens during the day.While I have a lot of responsibilities and stuff that I need to do, I just mindlessly browse the internet for literally the whole day and cannot get myself to do tasks I need to do, which are tasks that do not excite me whatsoever, this had led me to fail again and again in college, for which my parents are paying for and It makes me feel bad for them. But they would not understand If I talk to them honestly due to the culture I live in, they probably do not believe mental issues are real and would look down on me for opening up. They keep comparing me to my peers who are getting married and finding good jobs, which is making the whole situation worse for me. I am envious of those people who are able to keep their life in check when dealing with those things, and I despise myself for how lazy I am, I keep starting each year saying this; this year I am going to put in the work for real, and I get lost somewhere along the way and nearly at the end I think to myself where did it all go wrong? I still had hope because I am young and always thought to myself that yeah life sucks now but it will get better at some point, I guess It partially did some issues like self-image, but I was never consistently happy, I probably need to accept that this is something that is going to stay with me as long as I live.No one knows about my struggles, I put on ""everything is normal"" mask socially. With family, I am quite loved, I joke around a lot and bring good energy I think. And so I would never kill myself because I know how many this would hurt. I do not want to die either, but sometimes I wish I was never born and do have moments of suicidal ideation which is draining.Having no one to talk to about this for years now has begun to become physically painful, so this is my attempt to potentially relieve a bit of the pain. I know I should probably seek professional help, but honestly, I probably will not. Nobody to talk to and it hurts.",0
"I have been thinking about the two treatments today. I see similarities between both of them.Its almost as if you need to become a masochist and really want the pain in order to get better.Kind of explains why star athletes seek pain and why they succeed, and why they often fall into depression after retirement.Guh. Try retiring after wasting your life as an accountant or salesman. Then you will really question the point of seeking pain disguised as therapy.Easier just to be catatonic. Behavioral Activation Therapy and Exposure Therapy",0
"I am(16) just so tired. Fatigue that is indescribable. Everything is such a chore, socializing, past hobbies I have enjoyed, getting out of bed, hell even living on this planet is sufferable. Nothing is ever enough, medication, therapy, support from my family, what else could I possibly ask for? The bottles of pills on the counter look more tempting every day. Cutting myself and imagining leaving this world is the only enjoyment I feel. I want this pain to stop, and ending my life has come down to the last option, but I am only a few steps away from it. The guilt and shame that I feel in my own skin are getting overwhelming. it is like I am in a rainforest looking for a one-of-a-kind leaf, but that leaf is actually my purpose and will to live. Emotional pain is not the only problem, the restlessness and nausea from the extreme anxiety/paranoia are becoming insurmountable. I hate my family because they ACTUALLY care for me, without them I would have been gone a long time ago. Knowing that if I were to die, the emotional trauma and weight left behind would be devastating. I would rather give my life to someone who actually would care and appreciate it, not me. It could be in a few days, weeks, months, fuck I do not know, but I know it will happen someday. at my limit",1
"This is going to be a long (and not first) post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man, and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves (they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to), I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other ""elite"" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as ""normal-acting"" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TL;DR: Years of abandonment, avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is self-fulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS.: There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine, but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant.

Constant urge to off myself. Been depressed 11 years it never fucking gets better despite your generic shit BS advice. Been rejected and unwanted by all women my whole life.

"I am a trans woman who suffers from BPD, ADHD and severe anxiety. I feel like I just cannot go on. I have been suicidal since my teenage and i have attempted suicide twice. My last resort was starting HRT which made me significantly less miserable but since I am still ugly and my progress seems to have stopped after 2 years, I have no hope anymore. I do not think that i would be ever able to look at myself in the mirror and not want to throw up.I hate that I have adhd and bpd, these mental illnesses have ruined my life, not to mention the gender dysphoria which makes me cry every day. Sometimes i do not look at the mirror for days just to keep my sanity.I just cannot accept that i will look like this for the rest of my life, I cannot accept that nobody knows me as a woman but rather a predatory straight man. Just the other day my father said that I am transitioning to be able to have easier access to women and rape them. As a rape victim who was raped everyday at the age of 7 by my coach and later on by my classmates at high school, its so fucking unfair. I have internalized this fear and when around other women i just feel like I am occupying a space that is not for me and its wrong of me to be there. I am always afraid when I go out since I have been beaten up severely twice in the past and I am always sexually, physically and verbally harassed when I am out. I have lost almost all of my friends to transmisogyny and I am sure I will always be alone. The only people who want to date me are fetishizers who see me as an exotic creature between man and woman. I have never been able to find sb who does not see me like that.Nothing will change and I will always be in pain. So the wisest thing is to end things but i do not have the courage. Both times i attempted I chickened out. I am sure i will do the same again. But i cannot endure this hell anymore either. I feel suffocated There is no place in this world for girls like me and I just want out.",1
"I am so sick of opening my phone and seeing that I did not get any notifications, I am tired of people ignoring me, I am tired of people not responding to me. It makes me feel like I am not deserving of peoples time and attention taking literally 5 seconds out of their day for me. I hate that every single fucking time I talk to my mom she starts yelling at me or finds a way to turn it into an argument. I am so tired of my siblings treating me like I am background noise, they do not listen to me, they pay attention to their phones rather than what I am saying just they straight up do not listen to me when I am talking. How am I supposed to get more social if no one likes or respects me? I can never talk about how I feel with anyone because I do not have a therapist or any friends so I just keep my emotions bottled up all day or I just try to turn my emotions off. This is very bad because some days (like today) when I am so tired of everything I explode and I am full of negative emotions. Today I made a joke to my sister and she just said That was not funny. Even though I clearly just enjoyed telling her. I did not say anything else after that but I was really mad in my head. So I told our family group chat that I am sick of them ignoring me all the time and being mean to me for no reason and that I do not want to talk to them anymore. I regret doing that so much because guess what happened? No seriously guys take a wild guess :( they ignored me!! Now they probably think I am a sensitive drama queen and I feel 100 times worse. I did not write this because I want anyone to sympathize for me or pity me lol I just needed a place to vent srry I am so tired of feeling so alone",0
"I have been positive for HSV2 (genital herpes) for 2 years now, and after my pap smear last week I discovered I also have HPV. The doctor said she does not know what kind I have and will not test to see what kind because I am young (24). Having HSV and HPV greatly increases your chances of cervical cancer. I have been fighting suicidal ideation for years anyway, why keep trying? I have booked an appointment with my therapist for next week but need to stay out of The Dark Place until then. Life is completely burdensome. I do not want it, and cannot understand why anyone would want to stay here. I slept around because I hated myself and wanted to self harm. Now I get the consequences. I am done. Diagnosed with a 2nd STD. Ready to unalive.",0

"This time I really really though I had beaten the intrusive thoughts. I have not had a suicidal wish, a thought about not existing, in 3 years. I thought I had beaten it.But now all I can see and think about, is myself hanging somewhere, and my feet dangling lifeless above the floor. I am alone, so painfully painfully alone. My life does not matter, I have got little to no friends to speak of and they are all far away. Someday, when I finally die, it will be as if I had never existed. I did not think relapses would hit me so hard",1
I feel unstable and unable to be on my own at the momentThis week has been bad for me. I am suffering from a lot of trauma and for some reason its all surfacing this week. I scratched my roommate severely during a panic attack in which he was helping me. Its a huge scratch and is going to scar. He called 911 because of me. Last night I had suicidal thoughts and could not be separated from him. I have slept in the same bed as him for the past week. I cannot be away or else my mind wanders and last night I was feeling suicidal. I am so terrified my girlfriend is going to leave me for literally no reason. Were happy and love each other. My therapist cancelled our session today because she is sick and I feel like that is the only thing that could have calmed me down. I do not know what to do I feel unstable and unable to be on my own at the moment,1

"Title says it all. I am not encouraging this, but I feel kind of free in a way. it is like the things I have been struggling over are not such a big deal. I can accept that these issues are not going to keep happening, and that the pain I am in is only temporary. Not a life long sentence. I think that everyone has the right to end their own life if they are always in pain. I am disabled and have psychiatric conditions that make life absolutely miserable for me. I feel that no one cares because it is just all of the time. I am a burden on my friends &amp; family. I feel bad that all of this is going to traumatize them but I just feel like they will move on, and not have to deal with all of the trouble that comes with my illnesses. I made a plan and downloaded a really detailed book. I have not felt this kind of relief ever knowing that I will not be suffering like I am for much longer.",1
"I also posted this in the bipolar subreddit but I want to post it here too. :( So, I am on a mood stabilizer and wellbutrin and they are supposed to be helping my adhd and my mood and they are not. This sounds like I am just complaining but I am not trying to. I am just tired. I have tried so many antidepressants and each one makes me hypomanic. At this point though maybe that is preferable to how I am now, although my psychiatrist will probably never prescribe one to me again. Every day I come home and I try to get things done. What ends up happening is I collapse on the couch, my bed, or the floor in my room and stare off into space. I have no energy. Sometimes I have thoughts, sometimes I do not. I can picture a miniature me banging against my skull trying to get me to move or do something, literally anything, and I cannot. Have you guys felt this way too? These feelings are different than the crash depression that comes after mania - but perhaps it is still depression? Although I have been depressed before but this feels different. Maybe its obvious, I am sorry - but I have a lot of difficulty understanding my emotions. I have tried therapy but they just assume things. Maybe its like adhd depression or something? Or adhd making things worse? But I have no motivation whatsoever. Things that are sad or stressful happen and I am completely emotionless. At work when things get fast paced I completely dissociate and I feel like I am in a dream. And if I do cry, it stops and the emotions switch off. I feel like a robot or a machine, yet a useless one who cannot do anything. My brain feels like mush. there is so many things I could do - exercise, read, paint, study for an upcoming exam, play my instrument, bake, go outside. And yet time passes and I do nothing, aware of every minute that goes by that I am completely wasting. I feel like a fraud with my friends. With my family I am irritable and I am convinced they hate me more each day. Well, I hate me more each day too. They wonder how I can be taking my medication and still be this way. I do not know what the point of this is, I just want to be different. I want it all to go away. What is wrong with me",0

"I cannot do this anymore. I am at my breaking point. I cannot talk about this to my family because I do not want them to worry. I cannot talk to my mother about this because I already tried. I recall my mom saying something like ""we are all depressed here."" Those are not the words I wanted to hear. Hearing those words I felt a sharp pain in my heart. I cannot really talk about this to my father because he is a drunk. I cannot talk about this to my siblings because they mean so much to me. I cannot make them worry about me. It would break my heart. I cannot talk about this to my friends because I lost them a long time ago. I lost all my friends because I wanted to isolate myself from them. So when I did kill myself it would hurt them less. Haha I remember even telling my best friend at the time this. I hope she forgot about me, and live her life peacefully without me. I have this feeling for years, and it just will not shake off. I honestly wish I was not me. Thanks if you read the whole thing. I Just cannot Do This Anymore",1
"I do not know why things are so complicated but still simple. I am 18 (M) and feel a lot of weight of having to perform and earn a decent living for myself but also the expectation of having significant other too.I am now on a walk after helping my dad out with work because I felt like shit (not because of the work or my dad).If anything the walk just made me feel physically tired and lonely and shit. I thought this walk would be nice and refreshing but it was the total opposite. I just wanted to feel something nice but all I really feel is lonely and emptiness.Little things slowly nibble away at me:- Being denied a job opportunity for work experience- Seeing my friends hang out but I am just lonely af- Seeing others together and happy then I question what is wrong with me- Having in the back of my head that everyone else is going off to uni and having a great time and I am stuck by myself trying to scrape things up to hopefully get into pharmacy school (I do not even have much interest, I am only doing it to earn money because my interests will not be able to earn me sufficient money to live- Just feeling like nothing will get better despite my efforts which also just makes it harder to be and consistently stay motivated- Me gaining weight and looking less attractive than I already am.Any advice is appreciated, thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this.

"Hey, so as the title says, I feel like I am in some way broken. Therapy is not really changing that, even though I have been going through it for multiple years. Below, I will list some of the reasons I think I am broken. \- Therapy has stopped making any significant change to my state after a certain point \- I lose interest in any hobbies or potential interests very quickly \- I have enormous problems with laziness; I fail to do basic things, such as cleaning my room, buying myself clothes, making myself food etc. \- For that reason, I lack any sort of skill or knowledge that would be useful to my future life. I struggle with education. \- I find my world view to be constantly proven wrong, and I lack the energy to do much research \- I have trouble formulating my own opinions - I just parrot other people \- Social interactions are hard for me, I am very awkward in person. I fail to notice any subtle social cues and undertones. \- Building skills is difficult for me - I spend the vast majority of my time gaming, yet I am bad at any game I play and I fail to improve significantly over time \- I seem to be very unintelligent. I often find myself having trouble with solving simple life issues. I also cannot focus very well \- I am doing terribly in terms of driving, despite something around 40 hours behind the wheel \- I sleep a lot to avoid thinking or feeling bad. I am generally sleepy more than the average person \- I rely on my parents to do pretty much everything related to chores and general life stuff for me (I am 18). There are more things, but off the top of my head, that is what I have got. Does anybody feel this way? Am I really inherently broken and unable to succeed? What do you think about all this? Have a great day! I feel like my life is fucked, and I am broken beyond repair. [long post]",0
"I am so tired and exhausted every single day. I am 21 (F) living with my toxic family. My father died when I was 18. But I was not close to him. We barely had a relationship. He never really cared about kids. My earliest memory of my childhood is of him getting angry about some random thing and throwing away the food on the table and then hitting my mother. I have seen my mother get beaten up ever since I was a kid. She would hit him back while trying to defend herself. They would threaten to kill each other during fights. Kid me would try desperately to loosen my father's fists clenching my mother's hair. But I was just a small kid with no physical strength so I could not do much except beg and cry for them to stop hurting each other. This was long ago.One day, my grandmother (father's side) died and I guess something triggered within my dad (even tho he was not close to her AT ALL) and he lost his shit. He started behaving erratically. Few weeks later we find out through an office colleague of his that my father had been fired from his work. We had no idea. He used to go to ""work"" everyday in the morning. Turns out he was just pretending. Through this said colleague we got to know more: he had angry outburst at work, spouting weird stuff. After some more strange incidents (not going into details) we got an appointment with a psychiatrist and my dad was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. This was when the domestic abuse hit its peak. He became way more violent. I remember one day he broke my mother nose and she started bleeding. Fast forward to 2-3 years (I have no sense of time really, it all seems like a blur now), he stopped taking his meds, became super submissive, barely said anything. I realised eventually that he was depressed (exhibited all the signs). Things changed. Now my mother became the abuser. She would tell him to die, how useless he was, what a burden he was on us 24*7. She also started hitting him. I tried to stop. My father did not. He would just sit there and let her do it. I have an elder brother too but he had gone for college so I was the only one who had to witness all of this all alone with no help. This lasted for some time until he actually listened to her. He killed himself around a week after my 18th birthday. My mother found his body in the middle of the night.I am glad he is dead. At least, he does not have to suffer anymore. I do not know.But now, years after all of this shit, things somehow seem to have worsened (if that is even possible :/ ). I used it believe that once my father was gone from the picture, things would be better. We could lead a peaceful life. Oh boy was I wrong! My mother's toxicity oozed out. I think I have become the replacement of my father. Everyday it is the same thing. ""I am a useless, worthless piece of shit. A waste of space. How she regrets giving birth to me. How I am a crazy person who need help..."" and more. Manipulation, gaslighting, mental, emotional, physical abuse- you name it, she got it. I have (and still am) faced it all. I try my best to do all the chores and not make her angry but it never matters. She will find something to mock, taunt and insult me. I have no place or privacy to cry. it is shit.I have kept alllll this shit inside of me without a single soul knowing until recently. I told me best friend. Well, not everything but I gave a general overview. But I keep stopping myself from saying anything (about the present times) because it is all so intense and I do not think she would be able to handle all this. Even I cannot. Everyday is the same. I am so fucking exhausted and tired of everything. I wish I could kill myself but I have wayy too much hope to do it. I truly want to live a happier, healthier life because I deserve it. I deserve love and care. But my god, this is difficult. 21 years of trauma and I do not see an end to it. I wish I would cease to exist. Why is killing yourself so hard? I am dead inside. I need help but there is nothing. I have no motivation to do anything. No purpose in life. Sometimes I think I might be depressed but then again I am able to get up, do my chores. I do not know. I have also started seeing signs of trauma during arguments and confrontations and it scares me. Nothing seems to be go right in my life. Everything is a fucked up mess. When will this end? P. S. If you are still reading this fucked up tragedy of a life story, what is wrong with you? Lol. Thank you for reading. :) I swear the Universe has a vendetta against me",1
"Currently 22. Life keeps getting progressively getting worse. Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS, lots of friends, a girlfriend who loved me, good family life, confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance, she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression, have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things, joined a fraternity, went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school, just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 2-3 people I would consider friends, both at home and in school. Now I am a 22 year old sophomore.Troubles with the law and an accidental overdose in the past 2 years have just made things worse both mentally and in my day to day life. On probation, so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture (I go to a party/sports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95% of the social life ) Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem. At least then I had confidence and the motivation to go out and at least make the effort to improve my life. Now I just sit in my apartment/room all day. do not have motivation to try and make new friends because of how many times I have failed at it and a lack of self esteem. Tried countless therapists and different antidepressants. Just feel stuck, and I do not know what to do anymore. Just going through the motions. Life keeps getting worse",0
"I am feeling very suicidal. I do not want to die, just end the pain. I am newly graduated from college and very miserable. I do not want my family to know because they will just judge me and tell me that life is not that hard. However, I have nobody. I am very young and want to figure out what the hell is wrong with me so I can get the help that I need and live my best life! The only way I feel I can keep myself safe for the next 24 hours is either wait until the morning to call my weed dealer (weed helps numb my emotional pain) or check myself into a psychiatric hospital as soon as possible! I only have state insurance. What are my options in the Milwaukee area? How can I check myself into a mental hospital without anyone knowing?",1
"For 8 weeks I have been treated with an antidepressant. My mood fluctuates from normal to very bad (really really bad) during the day. I am afraid I have ultradian bipolarity. Can such mood swings be? When I feel depressed I do not react to positive things. I did not have hypomania, although I did feel euphoric for no reason (for 4 hours). I told my psychiatrist about this but he said he suspected I had a personality disorder. Before taking the antidepressant, I also had mood swings sometimes (it lasted for a week). The strangest thing is that I do not even have a diagnosis of depression and only have anxiety disorders. Are Mood Swings in UNIPOLAR Depression Normal?",0

I will always end up putting effort into unproductive things. I suffer excruciating loneliness, severe lack of self esteem. I feel like I have completely missed out on everything.

"For the last few months I have been feeling less and less powerful emotions. I do not feel genuine. Every time I talk to someone else, it feels like an act. I just go with the flow of the schedule my mother made for me. Wake up, take the dog for a walk, sit down to study, eat, go out for a jog, study more and sleep. I used to play some games and cube but I do not find any joy in those things anymore.And now for the last couple of weeks I feel like I spend every moment of my conscious day about falling off a building. I go through the day on autopilot with the thought of the wind rushing all over my body in the foreground of my thoughts.I had a girlfriend and a few friends before I started losing interest in interacting with others as it felt taxing and just boring. Slowly my interactions with them stopped.I do not even feel horny anymore, jacking off feels like just another task to do in the morning. I used to find people attractive but now everyone looks the same. I still try to act like a nice person when online because I thought that the whole happiness multiplies by sharing it had some weight to it but it does nothing for me.I have this empty feeling in my gut all the time. I try to ignore it by studying the whole day but it just does not stop.My father fucking hates me now after I told him about this, my mother is acting like I never told her about this.I tried to make myself happy by taking a couple of days to just do the things that made me happy but they feel like chores I imposed on myself.I just fucking hate that I spend every day thinking about falling but do not have the guts to really do it. I always feel at the verge of crying but can never cry. I feel like I am not a person any more.",1

"So some back story, my sister has always been my best friend. We have both struggled with mental health our whole lives and while I am starting to balance out she seems to keep getting worse and worse. We had been loving together with me supporting her with maintaining the household cleaning and it exhausted me. I got to the point where I no longer see her as my friend and it hurts.... I am at a loss with her, she does not seem to want to get to get better, will not take responsibility for the stressors she puts on herself, ex. She wants to emotional spend and then cannot afford bills and needs help. The most recent thing happened was she is not a clean person, and she never has been. I moved out of the house and across the state. I recently went back and walked into what can only be described as a pre hoarders situation. I fed her cats and one did not come down. I was genuinely concerned it might have died in the mess. I finally broke down and sent a picture of her bedroom to my mom. I finally told her that I failed her and could not keep up with my sister. I did not how else to help her. My dad reached out and apparently told her to either clean up or move out.(The house was owned by my parents and I was taking care of it for them while they were out of the country.) I went back this weekend and her room looked a ton better. My sister however told me if I ever tattled again then she would go no contact. I respect her decision but how do I show her that being supportive is not always coddling? That I want her to get better but I am at a loss for it. I have tried helping her clean, suggesting different coping methods and she always replies that she is too depressed to do anything about it. I just feel like she is perpetuating her own condition and it is breaking my heart. I am one step away from going no contact because it is hurting me so much. I know that this would not be the answer because of her health. I just feel like such a failure. I am about to lose my sister",0

"I have been dealing with suicidal ideation on and off since I was a kid. I am 33 now, these thoughts have only become more intense and frequent, my life has become more complicated, and I am tired. I used to use meth and I have not for almost six years now but the cravings have become intense and I am at the point where on the surface my life is stable but my mind is so fucked, I just really want to use. I know that is not going to help my depressive episodes but I feel so isolated I do not know if I care much anymore. I think I give off big ""leave me alone"" vibes because I struggle with social situations but I am desperate for someone to spend time with me and care for me. Crisis lines feel like a tiny bandaid. This subreddit has been really good for me to come to when I feel low but I cannot see myself being able to sustain this shit much longer. Literally the only thing that keeps me going is that I worry no one else will be able to care for my elderly, disabled, and grumpy cat. What the fuck will I do when she dies? I am just exhausted",1
"i do not give a shit about how it will make others feel, i do not give a shit about how painful it might be, it do not give a shit about the after-effects of it, i do not care about anything. My life is so completely fucked that I cannot repair it anymore and it is selfish for OTHERS to want me to stay. I am NOT being selfish wanting to die because apparently everything has to revolve around the feelings of other people and my feelings do not matter. i do not even feel sad when i think about doing it anymore.",1
"i attempted in march of this year, i overdosed but panicked last minute &amp; phoned an ambulance. i confided in my flatmate the next morning after nurses encouraged me to tell her. she picked me up from the hospital and both her &amp; her mum were angry and made me feel really guilty. i kind of understood but i just needed to know i was loved in that moment but it made me feel more like a burden. anyways we spoke about it a few weeks ago and she said honestly i thought you were selfish and ungrateful for doing that to everyone that loves you. that has stuck with me and i cannot stop thinking about it. it has made me feel guilty about everything. i need advice on what to do? i do not want it to impact our relationship but i cannot stop thinking about it and its really upset meanyone had any similar experiences?? thanks and sorry for the long post! friend called me selfish &amp; ungrateful because i attempted",1

"I live in a semi-tropical area where plants take over everything, but I feel like I have this horticultural curse that reflects on my life in general. I have tried to grow plants for years, even building wooden planters, but then once the plants sprout I leave them outside where they get destroyed by inevitable torrential rain. I just moved and have a dirt backyard that gets sun, so I hoed the dirt up and planted grass seed after reading how to do it, but even in this area I messed it up somehow. I also bought and planted some already grown peppers, but I know I will abandon them to being eaten by insects or just not ever eat what grows on them. The only things I have grown successfully are basil and hot peppers, but I just left them without eating them until I used them up. it is reflective of everything else I do in life, really. I just do not care enough to do anything I once was happy doing. I have cut off contact with all friends, completely fake my conversations, never play music, drink too much, do not exercise, and stopped taking medications and going to therapy a couple years ago since I realized I cannot even be honest with myself and was definitely not honest with my therapist. I feel like seeing grass grow will be something that helps me feel like I have not completely abandoned my will to live. I cannot even get grass to grow!",0
"Why is everything so difficult for me? Lately I have been feeling like I cannot make anything happen how I want it. I have a to do list and then everything is so difficult and time consuming to cross off. Its like for some reason everything is being made harder than it has to be. I try and take care of something and then it becomes so many more tasks than originally. That it feels like it never ends and therefore nothing gets done. Its been kind of depressing and demotivating because well if I put in all this effort and time and energy and still do not complete something once I run out of time, what is the pointIts frustrating I feel like I cannot do anything right. I am getting exhausted and feel burnt out. But do not feel like I even deserve to feel that way because nothing gets done. Why is everything so difficult for me to do?",0
"I am so depressed I just want to die. Like an elephant dies. ""He is just like some guy I met who died a few years ago."" My mind drift to his death. Sometimes he felt like I was crying, or I was sobbing, or he was so sad. There was so much sadness that broke apart the entire thing. A lot of times I felt like if I just stayed away from him, he would not become real to me. And in those few moments of sadness, it could be just me in the middle of the most emotional moments of our lives. He was so much more like them. Just my best friend of 14 years, and of course there was nothing to lose but him. But I know that he will always stay. There was no life in him. But it never came close to this. His own body was a part of my whole life. So sad",0

There is no escape from my life thought maybe I could fix myself with the military or something but I cannot even do that because my lungs do not work the second I find something I can overdose on or a gun I am killing myself on the spot. I fucking give up I hate my life I have no one, no job, got kicked out of school disowned, and the only things I used to have as an escape now just make me angry and miserable",1

"[IWTL how to lose weight]( yesterday, I posted this on the IWTL sub, and today I took the peoples advice from the sub and started my weight loss journey. I did some exercises for today and after I was done, I sat down with a healthy breakfast. As soon as I sat in front of the tv to eat, my mom taunted me, So you started exercising today? I said, Yeah. She suddenly told all my family that I(me) was not going to eat any butter or pasta or any junk food. I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister (18) chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen. This is a pattern now, every time I try to improve they react very very negatively, I feel like shit at my house. I do not know what to do. I started my self improvement and weight loss journey today and my family absolutely brought me down.",0
"I do not understand life. I look at happy people and I feel so jealous that their brains work the way they are supposed to. I understand why people who have experienced trauma can have debilitating psychological issues, my girlfriend is one of them so I can understand and empathize with her. But I am just a normal person, I have no trauma to trigger mental illness, nothing I can point to anyways, yeah my dad left me as a child, but I do not remember him. I have had alopecia since I was 7 and it has affected my social development, and of course this affected me negatively but of all the hardships I could have faced, I have it good. Yet I have been depressed as long as I can remember, my social anxiety is off the charts, I am an incompetent person, I am incapable of living a normal life, I cannot handle my responsibilities and obligations, I live like a child who expects people to clean after him and as a result my house is a mess (despite the fact that I think of myself as a neat freak and despise my living conditions) Financially I am a mess, I choose drugs and online shopping over my bills. I cannot maintain a relationship without letting my mental health affect and drag it down. I will not commit to working towards the career I dream of. I first thought about taking my life when I was in grade 3, to me it is normal to think about suicide, but when I step back and look at it, that is insane, Why would a young child want to die? What is wrong with me? and to anyone who can relate to this, what the hell is wrong with us? Why do not we possess the basic drive to live and succeed? If you read my post history you will see that I was broken up with by my fianc (whom I was with for 8 years) so it may look like I just fell into depression after that but I can assure you this has been hiding under the surface the whole time, she was a convenient crutch that I used ton hide my illness. I recently found a suicide note I wrote 2 years ago, when I was supposedly happily engaged and looking forward to my whole life. I have kind of gone on a tangent here, but back to my original point. What the hell is wrong with us? why do our brains want to kill us? I am 25 and I am supposed to be taking the world by storm and making a name and life for myself but instead I stagnate, I do nothing of value and I sleep all the time and hope that one day I just do not wake up. it is just not fair and I do not understand it. I would love to be normal for once in my life, but no. I have to have ridiculous overreactions and emotional breakdowns over things that everyone is supposed to just deal with. I despise myself even though the logical side of my brain tells me I am worthy and valuable. I know this cannot even be answered but I felt like ranting. Comment here and tell me your story, all the nitty gritty bullshit, I will read it, I will listen, And if you want, I will talk to you, I will take your pain and suffering on my shoulders, the only thing I ever feel good about is listening to others, it helps me feel less alone, because it seems like all we have is each other and I think maybe the best some of us can do is just be there for others who we can relate to Why are some of us just broken?

"Hi everyone, this is the first time I write something like this in such an open way, I hope you can understand me. My life really sucks, I am useless and full of defects. I am a 17 y male, but I have been rejected from school 2 times, changing 3 schools accordingly. I went from having a lot of friends, to not having even one, literally, I am alone, no girl has ever even talked to me, most likely because I am ugly, both aesthetically and physically, I have a hunchbacked nose, a normal ear while the other has an elf-like shape, due to a birth problem, I am full of pimples, and despite constantly using creams on creams, they do not cease to come back, I have short legs compared to the bust, it is really embarrassing, because I am tall like 5'11/1.80m but the legs are shorter than they should be. Yes, I am really depressed if you have not figured it out yet, but I was born like this, not a day goes by that I think about getting my nose or ear done again, most likely I also have a problem with my teeth or gums, which causes me to have a costantly bad breath,even if I clean my teeth several times every day, and I keep myself vert clean physically, but I do not know, I do not know what sense it makes for me to continue living this way, waking up and noticing that I am the only one to have all these problems, the only thing that perhaps makes me happy is the fact that my grandparents really loves me.

"Currently I am 25 and I am working in a bookstore, I started 3 years ago after leaving university. I like my job but the start was rough. So right now, I still live in the same house as my parents but a separate apartment in it. And the older I get, the more I realize that my parents are far from perfect and a lot of issues I have with my mental health come from their behavior. I have a very small family, only my parents and two grandma's with dementia. Long story short, my parentd are very protective of me, so a lot for me and almost always at home a d talking to me. Because of that, I have no skills, no ambition, no self esteem, no privacy. I want to move out anf maybe move far away, maybe even change jobs and become something else because working I retail is bad for my anxiety.And here is the problem when ever I tell people this, they ask me, well no problem, you will learn to live on your own and what do you love to do, that is your next job! Think is, I hab eno passions. I never learned to fight for something, instead I give everything up. Because bullying I have a hard time making friends, let alone keeping friendships. All three friends I have rn are living far away. I have no job or career path that sounds like fun to me. I am not made to work the same shit 40 hrs a week. there is nothing I want to do. Besides that, I have no experience in life because my parents do everything for me, I am afraid that if I move out I would call them 5 times a day, either because I need help or because I feel bad for leaving them. My life has nur purpose or sense. I am turning more and more into the person that normal people make fun of. I am joking ill be a weird cat lady when I am older but it is less and less funny. I am pathetic. And if I ask older people for advice all they say is that it will get better once I move put and that I can still find my passion and my I dependency, which helps me not at all. I am not even asking for help here because I feel like I am a person that cannot be helped. I am not made for life. I need to get this off my chest because I cannot tell this anyone in person. I have no goal in life, nothing I love or am good at. My life does not have a purpose.",0

"Hi all. I have both depression and anxiety. My mind is always at war with itself. I am constantly overthinking everything. I am an avid music lover. I love to listen to music constantly. I have to have the volume of whatever I am listening to super high, though. It drowns out all of the overthinking. You can overthink things if you cannot even hear you own thoughts, right? Sometimes if I am overthinking too much at bedtime, I can only fall asleep to loud music in my headphones. It probably is not the best for my ears, but it is what it is. Does anyone else relate?

"Follow these tips to lower your depression and tiredness:1. do not drink more than one cup of coffee in a day under any circumstances. And that one cup drink it only in the morning...not at any other time of day. More than one cup increases depression. And drink one cup of tea in the evening if possible2. Reduce screen brightness of phone and laptop?computer. And download f.lux for laptop/computer and twilight app for phone. These apps reduce blue light coming from screens. Blue light affects sleep and makes us tired.3. Go to sleep half hour early than you are doing now, and wake up half hour early.4. Take b complex pills ( pills containing b vitamins), one a day for a week and one very alternate day after that for a month.5. And visit a therapist and a psychiatrist. Take counselling and medication both. It works wonders.6. do not drink more than two sodas (softdrinks) a week. I give a shit about all of you.

"In this war I have waged inside my head, I begin to wonder what aspects have truly changed by my own will versus the changes that must be forced to be seen as socially acceptable. &amp;#x200B;I have come to understand that every area of psychology focuses on only a few key areas of supplication. Those areas being; this notion of fulfillment, extravertedness, emotional control and a generally positive disposition of others as a whole.&amp;#x200B;These 4 areas are explored more in depth through the practices of what is defined as ""Shadow work"" which is related to Carl Jung's concept of the shadow self. It is also similarly explored through something referred to as ""earned secure attachment"" or ESA for short. It is also the most fundamental aspect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as well as every modern form of therapy. &amp;#x200B;These 4 aspects, used to bombard the mind with thoughts and ideas that would encourage appropriate behavior. To supplicate the soul. &amp;#x200B;Allow me to divulge on each of these 4 aspects of self.&amp;#x200B;Fulfillment, being our most fundamental drive for purpose and reason. We often associate things such as power, finances, family, friendship, intimacy, attachment, love, acts of fulfillment such as in the arts (music, drawing, painting, photography, etc). Reasons for existence. &amp;#x200B;Extravertedness: our ability to maintain several outside connections. To be mentally safe and open around others, to rely upon others and allowing others to rely upon us.&amp;#x200B;Emotional control: emotions are messy and difficult in most occasions, thus you are asked to refrain from allowing certain emotions to be exposed or expressed. On the surface it is a rather simple notion. do not speak with rage, do not be jealous, do not be malicious. However, as with anything involving human interaction, it is more complicated than that. You might see this in someone is emotional response to death being laughter, or a person's reaction to rejection going nuclear and resulting in aggression or isolation. Such things are generally frowned upon and hence, rejected.&amp;#x200B;Positive disposition to others: you are required to view others in a generally ""good"" light. That others are worthy of trust, can be relied upon, are capable, are as conscientious as you are, things of that nature.&amp;#x200B;These are the measures of supplication. How well your mind has been beaten into submission. How well indoctrinated you are. These ideals of old do not ask about who you are nor what you want from this life. They are a rigid standard and if you do not adhere to it, then you must be sick in the head. There is no other solution. &amp;#x200B;However, knowing this, knowing that you desire to have some place in that system. To have those attachments and the security of it all. There are only two variables when it comes to the mind.&amp;#x200B;Either you are, or you are not. As much as they say there is no ""black and white"" their entire foundation of psychological understanding is built upon a black and white system. I do not say ""black and white"" as a reference to skin color, just to be clear. It is a measure between what is versus what is not. &amp;#x200B;So how can I figure out who I am when I know who society wants me to be and in knowing what is expected of me, how can I have that flexible sense of self and individuality? I know the biases that are present and I know the results they want to see, but what if that is not who I truly am? Or what if it does not matter? What if who I am is nothing more than what I am told to be?&amp;#x200B;There are only two roads. That of supplication and that of isolation. Supplication",0

"2 days ago I was lying on my floor, crying my eyes out, wanting nothing more than to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger. Right now I am sitting here, drinking a cup of coffee, eating a donut with my dogs asleep by my side, listening to some tunes, not a care in the world. Why cannot every day be like this? What makes today different? I am having a good day.",0
"I have achieved a lot in my 23 years of life. I am extremely fortunate to have friends who I have fun with and parents who are there for me. I have a fantastic job that I will be starting in a couple weeks. Everything should be all fine, right?Last year at around this time, I was drinking myself numb most nights. And when I would drink, I would write letters to myself, I would draw, and sometimes I would harm myself. The hole in my chest was so big. I gave up on all my friends and even myself. I realized that I needed to disappear because there is not any point in living if you are not held, why go on if you cannot believe in someone else?Now, a year later and deep down, that hole is still there. I have tried focusing on the positives but it is still there. I do not know how much longer I can take being alone. I want to find someone that I can believe in. I need someone to believe in. I hate the pangs of loneliness that I cannot get rid of even when I am with others. Sometimes, I even miss the wreck I was last year because at least I was dealing with my emotions rather than ignoring them.Everything I do feels hollow because there is not anyone in my life who understands how awful I really feel. what is the point in living if you are not understood?",0

"Honestly it feels like I am living a hell that was created for me. My father was negligent and never bothered to spend time with me, blaming it on the fact that I looked unapproachable. To this day he still owes my mother 8k in child support. My mother was abused and so, i too was abused both physically and mentally. I remember that when i was young, i did not want to shower because i did not want to get my hair wet, her solution was to put me at risk for hypothermia by keeping in a shower with freezing water. And honestly, to this day I never got over it. I never got over the fact that she never made time for me, meaning that I had to raise myself since I was 10 years old. I never got over her tantrums. Wherever I set her off, she would threaten to knock all of my teeth out. I finally moved out after a really shitty fight that made me feel like that place was not home. The place that I am at now does not feel like home either. I have 3 roommates and the two guys that I live with are such a hassle. The first one will not pick up after their dog and there is always a mess of fur everywhere. He will not even pick up after his dog's poop from outside. The second person believes that if he does not talk about his problems, they will go away eventually. they have resorted to calling me childish and immature because I get frustrated that they cannot pick up after themselves. They do not clean, put their dishes in the dishwasher, cook, etc. Even leaving the lights on all night knowing that it will raise the electrical bill. I honestly feel like maybe I am the one that is causing the problems. I am the one that just does not understand the people around me. But I just do not feel like I can right now. My mom uses me as a punching bag because her mother is passing away, my other grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago (whom I was much closer to), having to move out, trying to locate my first job, and having to deal with my own constant thoughts...I just cannot anymore. I am trying so hard to give myself a reason to still be here because I want to live most of all. I want to fail in love. I want to grow old. But most of all, I want to try new foods and see so many new things. If I left then I would never get to finish reading my webcomics. I would never get to listen to songs from Colliding with Mars and Unlike Pluto. I would never get to finish any of my favorite games. And I am still here because I recognize that my pain would just transfer over to my family. Just the thought of it all being over, it sounds like such a blissful idea. It makes me feel like I will finally be at peace.I would not have to cry anymore. I would not have to feel hopeless. I would not have to suffer. I finally would not feel so lonely. And I would not have to deal with the fact that I am emotionally fucked up. I wish that I knew how I can make things better. I want things to change but I do not know how or where to start. Because if I have to hold on, I know that sooner or later, I will let go. And when I do, there is no turning back. Every day feels like a burden",1
"How people have treated me about my lack of attractiveness, feeling undatable like the only way I will get to be with someone is if I date someone mentally unstable or disabled. Like that is what my worth is. It makes me suicidal. It makes me feel like my worth is down to who others think I should be with. People do not know what it feels like to be so agonisingly alone constantly day in and out ruthlessly. But then as soon as I spend time with people I cannot wait to be alone.I just want this fucking bullshit to end Is it worth killing myself because I truly believe Ill never find love?",1
"I have attempted a countless number of times. My first moment of ever thinking about ending my own life, I was in 3rd grade--about 8 or so. And before that I just felt extreme anxiety. I have never gotten a real chance to know how life is without mental illness. I have been on medication and therapy for yearrsss, tried and done lifestyle changes to the best of my ability. I have felt suicidal for weeks straight and it occupies my thoughts. At work, running arrands, talking to the few friends and connections I have somehow managed to make through my phone--all the time.I can only miraculously talk myself down from suicide so many times. I just do not want to go to another mental hospital, have my freedoms stripped away, just to hear some of the same ""it gets better"" ""color when you are triggered"" bs over and over--then get some massive bill. I can basically predict EXACTLY what a typical hotline will say and respond at this point. I am done telling people around me that I am suicidal when there is not shit they can do that they would be willing to do anyway. I will not have to deal with their guilt and ""helplessness"" in my suffering once I am dead. I have never known life without anxiety or depression",1

"I fell in love with this girl, I have not opened up about my feelings about her already.I do not want to.She far younger than me. I am 28 and she is 21. She has friends and dreams, while I am a rotting husk of a human being. No actual talents, only issues and self hatred. I feel the love between us could be anything but a good relationship. I never experienced a woman's love. I have been hurt so many times by people around me I find it difficult to open myself up.I only have sensitivity and some sort of empathy, which most of the times, is so overwhelming I have to shut it from the inside and repress it. I want her to be happy, I want to see her smile and listen to her laugh. My presence can only poison her soul. I fear, once she gets to know me, all these beautiful traits will fade, like a painting left under the rain. She truly deserves to be happy, alone or with someone else. She deserves better.",1

"So many events in the past, that should have no long lasting effect on me always pop out from nowhere. Just past traumas like screwing up my first semester for college or leaving some very close friends by resigning from a job to improve my grades in college. It hurts so bad and recently it has been worse than usual. I am really considering getting a prescription for antidepressants but I have heard that withdrawals are like 5x worse than the lowest low. I am taking psychology in college so I feel like I should have better control over my emotions but I am almost at my breaking point right now.I am in this depressive state where I just do not know what I am doing with my life and I have a need to compare myself to others worse off in some way just to make myself feel better which is an asshole thing to do, but it is hard to help it sometimes. what are some coping strategies that I could use to not feel like piss every moment I am awake? Life is being held back by past traumas",0
"2020 really amplified the issues in my marriage. My husband finally came clean and let me know he would been hiding and addiction from me for years. My constant loneliness and depression finally made sense- he was unable or unwilling to be there for me while he was using. He started his recovery and we started couples therapy again, but things remained stagnant.On top of all the issues, we were not intimate anymore. He told me he was not attracted to me because I had gained weight. That was brutal to hear. I reconnected with an ex at the end of 2020. I shared my problems with him and he listened. He told me I was beautiful and that my body was perfect to him. I ate it up.. an affair was born.Yesterday my husband confronted me- he would gone through my phone and seen messages with my ex. He was devastated.. packed up and left. I have been a mess. I cannot function, I cannot eat, cannot go too long without the sharp pain in my heart. Our relationship was filled with toxicity, but I want him back more than anything. I feel so lost and abandoned. We face timed last night and the pain in his eyes killed me. I realized I am grasping onto the idea of a relationship that never was. I am so scared of starting over. I hope he reaches out and asks that we try to work it out, but part of me feels that I should not even if he did. Please help- I am codependent and my separation is tearing me apart. My world is crumbling and I am barely holding on. My heart is hurting so much and I do not know what to do. Co-dependent and clinging onto my marriage. I feel so alone.",1
"It was a couple hours before work and I was playing a few games. I could not find one I was able to get into so I was just constantly switching titles. Eventually I stop all together and I am sitting there fighting unprovoked tears and burst into laughter for a few seconds.. then go back to crying. It alternated like this for 15-20 minutes and was then suddenly fine.I am 28 and went to therapy once a few years ago, but did not like it. Should i go back? This is not the first time something like this has happened and suspect it will not be the last. My fiance thinks I might be manic depressive, but I could not tell you. So last wednesday I had a weird breakdown and started laughing and crying.",0
My dad and his girlfriend think I am stupid. I am trying to transfer colleges and they think its a bad idea because they do not think I can handle it and some reason they think I do not want to go to school anymore. I worked so hard this past year to get out of the deep depression I was in for years and all of a sudden I am back in it. I cannot just drop everything and go to a hospital because I am a manager at work at a place that I love but I still do not have enough money to move out yet for another like three years it really sucks and I just want to give up so bad.

"I wish I could just run away from here and never look back. I wish I could just disappear and my siblings would forget about me and stop caring about me. I wish everyone who knows me forgot about my existence. I wish I could just start a new life somewhere else, have a fresh start and not be burdened with the connections and obligations of yesterday. If I was free from their minds, I would have nothing holding me back, and I could finally do it with peace of mind. I want to be free",1
"I have struggled with this so a really long time. After getting dumped. This only worsened. Right now I find myself comparing myself to the new guy, and put myself down. Is he more exciting? More confident or something. Has he accomplished so much more?

Every time I go to apply for jobs on Indeed or try to write down some sort of plan for the future, I just cannot do it. I physically feel nauseous thinking of having to be strong and try everyday. I want it all to end now. I do not want to build something for myself, I do not want to be successful. I just want to be air or a cloud. I do not like being human. Every time I have cared about someone, I lose them because I can become obsessive. My first crush landed me in the psych ward for 2 weeks because he did not like me back. that is what waiting for me whenever I catch feelings again. I cannot take this pain and I wish not to feel it. The bad significantly outweighs the good. I do not want to try anymore.",1
"Anyone who is christian and actually still believes in God this day and age, please tell him to either A. Leave me the fuck aloneB.

Fucking just send me to hell already, which is where my depressed ass probably rightfully belongs.Anyone still a Christian here? Not trying to insult anybody who is. If you are, and you truly believe in God, I am proud of you. I am glad he gave you a good life. Truly am. Unfortunately, he does not do that for everybody. Some of his human creation he simply does not give a shit about. So 9lease ask him to either kill me outright, or fucking help me . Or not. I do not really care amore at this point. Either way, I will probably be killing myself soon anyways. As is God's will. A message for all whom God loves out there",0
"This is something I have been working on inside my own head. Trying to understand the emotions, the thought processes, the reactions and how they all come together to form this entity that is typing these things out.&amp;#x200B;I have been to the lowest of lows. I suffer from excruciating depression daily. I have been this way most of my life and I have only been really starting to study for about 2 years now.&amp;#x200B;But I think I am starting to see all these different aspects of existence and life. I have been trying to concoct some sense of a motivation bomb if you will. &amp;#x200B;it is a mixture of consciousness, a physical sensation of burning in my chest, a physical sensation of slight pressure on my right temple, just the right amount of desire, a dash of willpower, a boatload of research and this image of a vault door unlocking and slowly opening up.&amp;#x200B;The factors behind this involve various bits and pieces I have come up with through my studies. Mostly in reference to personality, the concept of motivation, a general understanding of how human psychology works, a general understanding of social expectations and interactions and the center piece to it all, the conscious self.&amp;#x200B;With this, I have got many analogies. The concept of the entirety of the human race, similar to a bed of seafoam, drifting on the ocean. The concept of not needing love, but wanting it. To need it is to create stress and damage to those who come near. To be ok alone but still want that connection allows the ability to simply drift with one another through the ocean. That to fight all of this, the very nature of fighting all those thoughts and emotions inside because they are wrong and painful and bad, is not dissimilar to drowning. Fighting those waves feels exactly like drowning. &amp;#x200B;In my understanding of this, I begin to see the ocean for what it is, time. Just waves of time and each of us get our time to bask in the glory of the starlight as we flow through. We may not always see it or know it because sometimes the ocean is shallow, sometimes we are in the mud, face down, beaten, broken and afraid and sometimes it is just easier to stay there, somewhere out of reach, out of harm's way.&amp;#x200B;Yet the inevitable waves of agony always return. The onslaught of self loathing always crashes down. The fear to move forward always stabs us in the back because we choose to stay still. &amp;#x200B;An unchanging mind is like iron. Left to it is own devices, it will rust and decay. But given the opportunity to be in wise, caring hands it is shaped and molded and fortified. Like waters of life turned to this beautiful work of art as the blacksmith intricately and delicately works their magic.&amp;#x200B;Hammering away at imperfections, chiseling flaws and smelting away impurities to produce the finest of blades. Caressing the edges for the sharpest of blades. Decorating the handle for the most beautiful of blades. &amp;#x200B;From this moment we begin to see the final product in it is full glory. From what was once a mere bubble, lost out at sea. Only to be tasked to enter the trials of hardship of life as each and every single one crawled through the mud. They did not know at the time that this mud contained the iron in which they would take shape later in life and as they entered the final phase, the mind was separated from itself. Between conscious and emotion, morality and ethics, right and wrong, who am I and who I am. &amp;#x200B;Through the research and wisdom of those minds who came before me and the few minds who were there for today. I begin my own process of smelting away the old, filtering the impurities that I know to be of ill value, molding the cast of this persona and understanding the form that I must fill.&amp;#x200B;The night is always darkest just before the dawn. The perfect mix",0

I feel like the time between waking up and falling asleep is just time that needs to pass. Every goal is just a way to pass the time until the very end. Its so draining thinking of plans to do. I do not even have the energy to get off this couch. This couch which eating me up. I sit here wrapped in a blanket. High. Disassociating out the window. Staring into a screen.

Wasting away staring at nothing. Mornings are the worst,1

"I am (23f) so tired of being alive. Saying I have had a tough couple of years is an understatement. Many family members have died from suicide or drug overdose, sexual assaults, and just day to day misery. I have become addicted to drugs, one of which being heroin. But it does not make me happy. Nothing makes me happy. My boyfriend says I make his life miserable, I know I make everyone is life miserable. I am just a self centered bitch. My mom was just diagnosed with MS and she should not have to deal with me. I know my death would hurt her a lot but I am so so tired. I want it to be over",1
"I think about suicide every day. It has been like this for many years now.I am now 50 and have spent most of my life working where it has been the main focus of my life. I had success but most of the money went to investors (founded a company that sold for $27M). Have been working on another startup for 8 years and making minimal income and living off savings. Doing it all myself as I do not trust people anymore. Been through a divorce caused by this and was in a marriage that meant I could not properly run my new startup for most of that time. Ex took half my assets and I am sure was putting a lot extra away for years.It is ridiculously hard. I have a product as good as anything in the market and comparable to other products raising 10's of millions of dollars. But I cannot get it out there, nothing I do works enough. I now have a product that probably requires a team of developers and I am maintaining it all myself and trying to grow the business.I am just so tired, burnt out and depressed I cannot do the things I need to do to make this work anymore and I feel I am going to lose everything.The only thing keeping me going is the thought that I have the product and the hope that one day I will get noticed or will be able to get my marketing sorted and get in front of the right customers.I feel I am going backwards and everyone I know seems to be going forward on easy mode. Home are going up in value (we sold our beautiful big house in the divorce and now renting), well paying jobs with minimal effort (IT).I just spent my entire weekend working and doubt it will make a dent while other people are enjoying their lives.I will never find a partner again as I am financially ruining myself.I just want to end it all but my 10 year old daughter still needs me. It would devastate her if I was gone. For the last few years I have just been thinking try to last as long as you can until she does not need you as much (maybe 16). I am not living for any future now, I do not look forward to anything. Every day I wake up and say to myself 'I want to die'.She is still full of hope and tells me about her dream house and dream bedroom etc and says things like ""daddy when your website gets better do you think we could get a new house etc"". Once we had the best house of her friends and now are just renting and they are all buying new homes.I look at her now and love her so much. But wish she had a better dad as I feel I am spiralling down. The hardest part is I know I could have given her so much more.I called a support line on friday and am going to a doctor today to get some help.At the core I think the main problem is I hate myself, do not value myself and probably do not feel like I deserve love or success and that derails everything I do.Sorry if this has been rambling.

"This is not exclusively a comment on my life; but on the lives of many. As they say, life is not fair. Yet the part that we do not want to think about is: how does one cope with the pain? What does one do once their pain is too much for them? If we discuss it from a moral standpoint, the answer is clear. If existence causes someone such suffering, ending that existence is the humane course of action. That is why we put down pets who have terminal illnesses that cannot be cured. Yet when it is a human being, this suddenly is no longer the case. The humane course of action is to commit the person to extensive and grueling mental training in a decrepit and underfunded system in the hopes that it may change their mindset. This just teaches them to put up with it, not improving their quality of life. Therefore, it is essentially an incurable illness with an option for treatment. However, if someone goes through the treatment and has so little improvement that they still believe their life is worth ending, who is anybody else to stop them. It is cruel to try to keep pushing them back into the mental health system, against their will and best interest. Yet we deem this morally acceptable and go so far as to expect people to report worrisome behavior to professionals so that those people can be forced into treatment. Existence is pain, and for many, this pain is too great to bear. These people should have the right to end their life, free of the stigma and resistance society and the establishment impose. I have been through the mental health system twice, hospital down to personal therapy. I have seen little to no improvement in my quality of life, only a change in mindset that tells me to do something to take my mind off of my issue instead of confronting it and trying to solve it. I cannot deal with my pain any longer, and logically the solution is suicide, yet any time I begin to set up a plan I get caught. It frustrates the hell out of me that people refuse to let me do what I want with my life. Existence is Pain",0

I was wondering if it is depression because I can count how many times I have been happy the past few months and I really hate how I feel most of the time, I use day dreaming and weed now as a way to escape but every time reality hits harder.

"i daydream a lot (or used to, until my concentration got to bad). it is maladaptive daydreaming, probably. i can imagine myself in my own body (not the one I am stuck in) doing such wonderful, ordinary things. everything my depression robbed me of can still exist in my imagination. it used to be freeing, now it reminds me of the pains of reality. i can imagine someone with me, i can imagine their arms around me, but it does not bring me the warmth it used to. it cuts into my heart like knives, knowing i will never be loved. circumstance and my own flaws have taken away any chance at love. i can imagine my body, cured of defects, face finally recognizable as my own. but it only reminds me of what can never be. i am incurable, even if i had the money for plastic surgery, i have no photo for reference. i only exist in my mind. to everyone else i still am the body i inhabit, even though the owner died years ago. i know I am insane, it is just a matter of time until my grip on reality breaks completely. i hold on only for the people i love. if mercy exists in this world, they will all outlive me.sorry for the rambling, i know it is illegible. i have nowhere else to turn. depression has driven me insane",1
"I want to blame this on the whole covid situation.. Before covid I was almost never depressed, then from being at home 24/7 and less socializing I found I just started to become more depressed. It was not that bad until about 2 months ago, I started getting more panic attacks than usual, more anxious, feeling suicidal, my emotions have been everywhere and I feel like its starting to effect my relationship with my boyfriend. I am terrified I am going to go too far with being emotionally unstable that he will not want to be with me anymore. We live together (1.5 years) and both have been either unemployed (because of covid) or working from home, so were almost together 24/7. I am suppose to start full time in two weeks at my new job that is not at work from home so I am hoping that will help with my emotions.Also another reason why I might be more depressed.. about a year ago I quit my full time job since my boyfriend and I moved, it was a good paying job in my field, but I had to quit to move across Canada. This was for his job, which did not actually happen when we got their because of covid (It was for a coaching job). Today, A year later, we moved back to our hometown and my old manager said he would hire me back when they need people in my field. So if that could happen my emotions would be sorted out. Sorry if this is not really a post about depression, this whole year has just been making me depressed and sad.Has anyone else's depression gotten worse because of covid? Covid made my depression worse",0
"I have been hearing, reading etc about how ADHD shows in womxn, specifically adult womxn, and I check off so many boxes. Does anyone have any kind of experience with these as a comorbidity or one diagnosis vs another? Learning about ADHD. Now I am wondering if I am mis diagnosed.",0
"I am going to kill myself today, (refer to my previous posts for reasons). I am thinking of overdosing, but last time I overdosed on my antidepressants (Cymbalta) I survived. The only medication I have is Tylenol. I have 4 Tylenol night times, so hopefully I can just drift off to sleep, plus, a whole bottle of regular extra strength Tylenols. Does anyone have any experiences or know what the process of overdosing on Tylenol is like? I know it can because acute liver failure, but hopefully it will happen in my sleep and I will just die. How painful is death by Tylenol?",1
"TLDR: I cannot stop obsessing and thinking about the pain of my breakup and I am getting ready to die so I do not have to feel these emotions anymoreMy girlfriend who I loved and cared for deeply broke up with me. She was my only support structure as I have no friends whatsoever and a very unsupportive and non understanding family. She talked with me semi frequently for about a month after the breakup but I could tell it was purely out of pity. She started dating someone new very quickly afterwards after swearing she would not which only amplified the feelings of pain abandonment and not being good enough. She blocked me last night after I pissed her off because every time we talked I could not stop talking about the breakup, trying to see what happened and get her to tell me how she felt and what went wrong.At this point I am ready to die. I cannot calm myself down or feel any better. Talking to strangers on reddit helps a little but nothing is replacing her for me. I miss my constant companion and friend. I miss voice chats and gaming together and I know it is not all my fault, but I feel it is all my fault. I am heavily considering to kill myself to get her out of my head and stop feeling all these feelings of pain. they are too intense for me to handle. Feel like killing myself to stop the intrusive thoughts.",1
"Depressed and passively suicidal and depressed and actively suicidal. I know Ill hate being alive in the future. There are far too many factors that will contribute to that, and I am quite unable to change them. Most of the time I am passively suicidal, but for the past week, I have been in wisdom tooth pain after having to pay over $2k out of pocket for surgery and I think I might have a cracked tooth and dry sockets and this is definitely one of those times my life in the present is terrible as well so I become actively suicidal. The labor market Ill be entering and have to participate in for the rest of my life is horrific and worsening, as is the housing market, as is the degree to which consumerism preys on people. Nothing I can do personally will change these things. I am so burnt out already from school (a degree from which employers increasingly favor because they get to outsource the expenses of training and turnover to employees ). I am going to be so burnt out from work. I am going to be unhappy for the rest of my life. Life costs so much yet returns so little. Why cannot I just die now? I have had two different states of mental health for the last 5-7 years",0
"Am I just overreacting that I have depression or not, I do not even care at this point Is it all just drama?",0
I just need another human to talk to. I am scared Is there anyone that can play a game with me or something,1
"Hi, I am 43 old, bipolar. I never had any goal in life, never was financially independent. i still live with mom. My professional experience is 2 years long. I spent most of my time feeling sorry for myself. I stopped my medication quite a few time and ended up in hospital with a long depression that would linger for years. Socially I never fit, I had occasional friends. I do not remember a time when I was really happy. That was my life before IT happened.A year ago strange things started to happen to me, I would have unusual mood swings. Moment of gratitude and dull moment all in one day. I never had that before usually it is period of euphoria followed by period of melancholia. Now it was happening all in one day. I became mystical, believing God was behind every aspect of my life, every small detail. There are moment I feel OK and there are moment I feel totally lost. I do not understand what is happening to me.I talked to my psychiatrist about it, he suggested an antidepressant. I do not want to take it because I believe somehow the grace of God is in me but I doubt and that is killing me. Has anyone felt this kaleidoscope of feelings trapped in a short period of time like he was a divine instrument. another zone",0
"Just when I think I am starting to get better and get a hold of my anxiety &amp; depression, something triggers me and I am back to feeling an immense amount of pain and suicidal thoughts. Its so scary when you are brain is constantly telling you that you are better off dead. I do not really want to die, I want to be somewhat at peace with myself and just live a decent life. It feels like that is just not going to happen for me. Sometimes I truly think that I was destined to commit suicide. I am hanging on by a thread at this point and as time goes on the hope I have left gets smaller and smaller. I cannot make any friends due to social anxiety and now spend almost all my days alone. I think I have a decent personality but no one ever gets to see it because of my sa. I feel like everyone just hates me. what is the point of life if you cannot even make meaningful relationships with people? I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either. So tired of trying to get better and constantly being knocked down. My depression has me in a chokehold rn and I am trying so hard to not end it. I deserve to be happy and live a good life. I am not giving up on myself yet Just when I think I am getting better",0
Sometimes I feel like something is wrong with my body and I feel like I am dying but I am not suicidal tho. I do not think I can even hurt myself intentionally but from time to time I have these intrusive thoughts that I my have undiagnosed disease/illness and that maybe I am dying or something. :(( I feel like I am dying but not suicidal,0
"Excuse my grammar, English is not my first language. I am Male, 25 yrs old. Suffering from major depression, anxiety, avoidant personality disorders. Tried to kill myself twice almost 5 years ago. Mom died when I was 8 yrs, father passed away 3 yrs ago. I have been going to therapy since a month ago and I have started to feel more miserable. I like my therapist, she is extremely empathic and understanding. But sometimes she tries to put words in my mouth. I discussed about my problem of social withdrawal and anxiety. I am very hypersensitive person. While I avoid people because I have had horrible experience with people and prefer to be alone. I cannot emotionally connect to people. She said ""The problem lies in my thoughts. External forces are not majorly responsible for your anxiety"" Some of the opinions is hard to digest. I can understand from her POV. Eventhough I tried to change myself, it is very hard for people to accept who I am. it is true that my interpersonal skills are not the best. Does that mean problem lies in myself? Or external world does not have much influence for my avoidant personality? I have been hurt by people but I hate being lonely. Therapy making me feel much worse. Need help",0
"Part of me does not want to die, I think that is just my instinct not to, but a larger part of me feels like there is no other option. Every day or week or month I feel myself getting closer and I am scared. 20F",0
A natural death strikes me as much worse than suicide. I felt powerless and the pain just dragged on and on. I thought I was dying of a heart attack and I realized something.,1
"I am only 21M, but I always have this feeling like my life has passed me by. Its like people who are getting older and then realize they wasted their life, or that they never fulfilled their dreams. Right now, I am going to art school. I really want to be a writer. Lately, I have been pretty lacking in motivation blah blah depression.So, part of the reason I am depressed is because I have contemplated transferring for a long time. I am not sure why I am obsessed with going to another school, but I feel like I am not good enough to stay or be a writer. But I also do not want everything to pass me by. Overall, I am just feeling lost. What is this? I am sure I am not alone in feeling this way. But I do not know how to cope with the days of deep depression, feeling like people want nothing to do with me, or thinking about running away. I always feel so old.",0
"Almost every day now I lie in bed and stare at the ceiling or curl under the covers and ask myself how did I get here? I used to be so happy when I was a kid. I had so many friends, all of which I would say hello to on the way to class- now I do not even go outside anymore. You know, we did not even get a High School graduation? It was a Google slideshow with pictures that we submitted and our names on it. I now attend online classes in my college with barely anybody to talk to, and every time I click the leave button the smile vanishes from my face.My friends were my lifeline; my parents separated when I was young, and I suppose I would go to said friends to mitigate that feeling of family. I live with my mother, but she is endlessly working and always spends her sleeping or watching TV. She says she is working for my future- so that I can continue on in my life well set and without worry- but I wish she would stop worrying about how I feel in the future and worry about how I feel now. With her, almost every thing I do has something wrong. Its never enough: from the way I bring the groceries inside the house to the way I place the blanket over my body when I go to bed, there is always something that has to be corrected. She says she tells me these things so that I know how to do them properly, but she says them with such spite and anger that I cannot possibly believe that statement. I have tried to tell her how I feel on multiple occasions, but she does not understand; she tells me that these things are a part of life and that I should learn how to deal with them. Even if only once, I long for a stroke on the head and her voice to tell me that its all going to be okay.I wish I had someone to tell me that its going to be fine, someone to hold me and tell me that things are going to change for the better. I wish I had someone.",0
I just wrote a very long rant that put how a i feel into a way that was somewhat manageable to read. I just accidentally deleted all of it and I think that accurately describes my life. :(,0
Honestly have not been happy for the past 2 -4 years at all had happy moments but overall feel like I am a fucking failure. I have no friends (went to an alternitive school)no car and right now not even working. I feel like shit just laying in bed all day playing games watching movies and hitting my pen. I am just over doing the same thing everyday i have not even been out once with a group a friends and this is my last year of h.s fucking pathetic. I go on walks does not help i cannot go to my mom or else she will want to bring me to a hospital and that is not what i want to be in some room with someone else on watch.Yeah no I am just tired of it all life does not even feel good I am just here watching everyone else live life. It seems stupid to me too work a 9-5 come home sleep go back to work and maybe get to enjoy yourself 2/7 days no thanks seems pointless i want to end itJust do not know how. Iknow it would hurt my family but it just does not seem worth it anymore Lifes Dark,1
I had the worst 2 weeks of dysphoria and self hatred but I got up and did stuff like brushing my teeth worked on my project etc. Then my parents come in to berate me about my room and how I still do not have a job nor am I studying. I just took 2 weeks worth of antidepressants and I am hoping this does something to me. It was a pleasure not really want to keep me company while whatever effects kick in? My parents are pushing me,1

My best and only friend does not even talk to me or care about me anymore. I asked her if she even loves or cares about me and she did not even replied. Then I asked her if she was mad or sad over me and she said no so what is the problem I am trying my best I feel like I cannot breath I feel like my heart was stabbed and then stepped on I feel like I cannot do without her. She helped me through so much thing. I cannot even breathe,0
"I keep showing a happy face to everyone but in reality all I want in my life is to not have a life anymore. I do not want to kill myself, I just want to die somehow, painless... Does anyone else feels like that too? Will I ever stop waiting for my death to come?",0
"I am 27 years old now, productive and cheerful person, well that is what they are all thinking but everytime I am alone (which is most of the time now), I always think of what is the point of waking up? My family depends on me, financially. Is this what I am supposed to be? Do I need to do shit just to prove my worth? I do not know how I will continue my life being this miserable. I do not want to ruin someone is life by sticking with them too much but I also do not know where else to go My life feels like a mess..",0
"I am gone. Today marks 5 years being involuntarily single. I have gone through the 5 stages of grief a dozen times, been through therapy until my therapists gave up on me and referred me to someone who would also give up and refer me and rinse and repeat, I have attended self-improvement classes, gotten makeovers with professional advice, lost weight and gotten fit, improved my social confidence, attended numerous programs and groups and activities, tried online dating, tried blind dating but my dates walked out when they saw me, tried friends setting me up but the woman says to my friends she would not date me in a thousand years, moved towns, travelled the country, travelled to other countries and travelled to Japan and learned Japanese and when that did not work did the same for Germany, trying to meet women from different cultures. In all this time after all this pain and sweat and effort and periods of just trying to let it happen on its own, trying to make it happen, going back to not trying. And now, I am realizing I am marked from birth to be alone. So goodbye to you all. Yes, it is Aaron. And I will always love you D, even though you never loved me. Done with empty promises, empty advice.",1

"Therapy is not working, nothing's working. I spend my days going to work, cracking jokes and putting on a show and when I come home at night I have nothing left. I end up just staring at my phone or distracting myself for hours until I fall asleep. I just want to crawl into a dark cave and cease to exist. I am too much of a coward to hang myself because I do not want the pain or the inconvenience to anyone else. Maybe I am thinking about it wrong - the inconvenience to everyone would at least be fleeting. Get all my affairs in order first? Make sure wherever my useless carcass ends up that it is at least easy to get rid of, everyone can just move on and forget about me. I will leave a note saying I do not want to be flown home, that they can just bury me in the ground or burn me - whatever costs the least. My friends and family will not have to worry about me anymore, they will know where I am. I will be dead. I am just so so tired of being apathetic. Hiding through laughter is just so exhausting. I am a shitty friend who can barely even muster up congratulations and happy feelings for the engagement of 2 of my best friends. They must see it and think I am such a selfish cunt. And they are right. I am so caught up in my own swirling misery that I cannot even come up for air to be happy for them. Every person in my life is moving on, growing up and becoming these incredible humans who I could never hope to be like. I have wasted my life. I am 31, alone and aimless. Music, comedy, art, all things that used to give me so much joy now just make me so sad. it is like I have already died. I was not always this way. 9 months ago, the love of my life decided to start an affair with his work colleague. I never saw it coming - no one did. I honestly thought that that was it for us, that we really loved each other and we would have some boring and clich happily ever after.She was a friend - beautiful, accomplished. Everything I am not. It carried on for 3 months whilst I lived in a complete fantasy land of my own making. 5 years of happiness, of future plans and excitement, extinguished in an instant. He moved out 6 months ago. I still see him from time to time. Him and her are not together. I still love him. He cares about me, but only through guilt.I do not want to hurt him, but I am hurting myself by continuing to be here. The thing is, I forgive him. I forgive him for what he did to me and our lives. he will be better off not having to worry about me anymore. he will be able to get back together with her and no longer feel guilt. I want him to be happy and I want to set him free. I want to set myself free too. Someone Thanos-snap me already",1
I am currently going to university but I am lazy and depressed so I did not do any work. I decided that an apprenticeship would be better for me and I am expecting an email from a law firm I applied at. I told my mom that I wrote multible job applications but I did not and I genuinely do not know what to do if I do not get the job. At this point I feel like suicide is the best option for me because I do not want to worry anymore and I have absolutely no will to live. I think the only reason I have not done it already is because I do not know how. Is suicide a valid career choice?,1
"Just shouting into the void. It seems no matter what I do I cannot seem to fix anything or make any progress. I hate living. Life sucks I am so tired of trying yet I am not trying anything at all. My heads all scrambled, I cannot stop for a second or else I begin to think of all the things I do not want to. I have said to myself way too many times ""I do not know how much longer I can take this."" I do not know if I am repeating myself I want to let some of this pain out but I am too scares to show weakness. Such a shitty feeling. Hope you all are doing well. If your feeling as shitty as me I want you to know at least we are in this together. we will make it through this. Stay strong. Life does not really ever seem to get better huh?",1
"I always try to avoid birthday dinner because I cannot handle being in groups but this time my grandma practically begged me. I went today but no one responded to the things I said or someone copied it like it was their idea. It was like I was a ghost.

"I thought it was getting better. I must be fucking braindead. How do I convince myself of such absolute untruths? It will never get better. I could not be any more painfully aware of this, yet I still manage to periodically find myself falling for idealist fantasies in which every waking moment of life is not pain. Every time I do this the crashing pain of returning to reality drives me one step closer to finally doing what I know is right. Why do I continue to live like this? I have no reason to suffer as I do, yet I live on. Is it masochism? Stupidity? Guilt? I do not fucking know. The only thing I can be confident in is knowing my time on this earth will inevitably be cut off by my own hands and nothing brings such solace and joy as that thought. I thought it was getting better..",1

"I lose motivation quick unless its something I am passionate about or I keep reminding myself of it. I have always been one to take part in activities that waste my time and now at almost 20 I feel like if I continue to do so, life will pass me by like it did my parents. I have a fire deep inside to become successful in life (we all have different perspectives on success) and I really want to make my life fulfilling in some way. I have battled depression since I was about 13 or so, starting with being left out of things growing up. Which led me to pick up things that waste my time instead of going outside. Now I have turned those time wasting things into wasting time with physical activity. But I want to make it happen in my life financially. I want to move to a new place and make new friends. I do not want to live miserably all my life because my family is linked with hereditary depression. I want to coexist with this monster. Should I look into finding a mentor that can provide insight? Should I make sticky notes to remind myself to keep at it every single day? The initial step to get out of my current rut has been taken, but I do not know where to go from here. Anything you all say will be taken to heart by me. I really mean what I say here. Thanks for taking the time to read this. How can I stay motivated when I find it much harder for motivation to be internally produced in my mind?",0
"hi, I am going to try to not make this too long, but, for the past year or so I have been feeling horrible. my whole life I have always struggled with thinking about doing it, but always convinced myself that i have it so well. but, long story short, since last quarantine i built up a really good youtube channel with over 60k+ subscribers and a loyal fanbase, but its really all too much. so many people have said horrible things to me, i see people say mean things about my appearance and voice, (even in places where they would not think id see it, they just post it.) i see people reply to cringey comments I have made 2+ years ago like oh hey did not expect to see you here and it FREAKS ME OUT. i feel like i always have eyes on me and i am not built for this. like the title says, I am only 16, and all this youtube stuff built on top of my already existing depression has me feeling left with no other option. and yes, I have tried quitting, (silently though, i did not announce my departure) and people just got mad that i did not upload and started to unsubscribe. it suuuucks. idk what to do anymore, thanks for reading this if you did, that is about it. i do not think I am going to ever do it, but i cannot go a single day without thinking about it. alright bye. 16 and in a tough rlly specific situation",1

"I feel like years of depression and anxiety made my brain rot. I could never pay attention, remember anything or understand things as good or fast as others could but it is only gotten worse. Whenever I managed to get enough motivation to read because I knew the words I read in the book but did not understand what they meant. When I needed advice from someone but still did not get it after the third explanation because I either was not paying attention for some reason or nothing made sense. I often got asked ""is this too hard to understand or is it something else?"" I always said, that I needed more time or I had a bad day but in reality I might just be stupid. Honestly I cannot even deny it anymore and I feel like I am making a fool of myself for trying. Being stupid is hard. I cannot do anything right because I am too stupid",0

I have forced her to come out with me for dinner, for adventures etc she still goes back into this she will. I spoke to our parents about it and they just shrug their shoulders.

It has now reached the point where I have 3 suicide attempts in the last month and guess what still nothing. Who now do I turn to ? I just find it very sad that our NHS is praised on how good a job they are doing when in really this is what is happening across the whole NHS board. Suicide rates are hitting all time highs and lockdown has has a major impact on these figures I understand this but how can they praise the NHS for saving so many lives in one way but ignore the lives they are losing in others ? Mental health a joke",1

A lot has happened the past couple of days, its hard to process.. everyday I wake up and this feels like a literal nightmare. I also do not know if I can trust anymore, I just feel so sad and I want to end it all. there is no hope left, I do not see a future, I do not see all the great things others see, I just see more trouble, obstacles up ahead, I have been through so much already and I do not want to go through more. My city has been in shambles and under attack because of looting and violence, buildings have been burnt to the ground and now that things are a bit quiet they want to rebuild. The residents would patrol everyday and night, taking turns but they issued a statement that they have done their job and they will not be patrolling anymore which makes me anxious and afraid, I feel as if they are letting their guard down way too early :( those looters want to come destroy our homes and lives too. I do not have a good feeling about this, how can anyone feels safe after this? This life is already unbearable, I do not feel good being alive anymore there is nothing for me here.. I want to leave bed for I suffer more.. its scary, I cannot explain this to people. I feel sick to my stomach. Its only a matter of time before they get us. I have lost my appetite and my will to live.",0

"I think a huge thing that makes me so depressed is the fact that nothing is permanent. Knowing some day my friends and loved ones will die, some day I will graduate, some day my favorite shows will end, my favorite bands will disband, my boyfriends will leave me, etc; knowing all of it will all end is so distressing. If I make it to 18 I want to get tattoos. Even if they fade, I want to get SOMETHING that is permanent. Maybe when I am 18 things will be better and I can get a cool ""i got over my depression"" tattoo...I do not know if I can go that far, in all honesty. I do not want to kill myself but I do not want to keep seeing everything around me end. Whether its now or in the future I do not want to see the things I love end or die or disappear. I do not want to keep living and it feels like a matter of time before I suck it up and just end it, or until I find that painless method I have been hoping for, or until I come to terms with what happens after death. I know the bad things are permanent. Are there any good things that are permanent? Please tell me about them. Give me something to look forward to. What is permanent?",1

"The thought to end my life constantly plays in the background of my mind. A part of me has made peace with the thought that that is probably going to be the way I die down the road; Ill get tired of fighting and finally just give in.

A part of me knows that I should feel grateful to have people in my life that want me around, but I just feel guilt. I wish I cared about my life as much as they do.

"The crushing loneliness. Arguments. People lying to me, using me. Being the backup plan. My mom who had cancer with a high risk of return.I am done man I am turning 21 coming Tuesday and I do not care! I really do not give a shit. What is everyone elses summer break? Partying, hooking up, getting to know new people.Mine is the same everyday. Get up, play video games. Be mad at everything, wallow in sadness and envy. August comes and its back to the grindstone for college until the day comes I graduate and I can slave away for corporations until I am in my late 60s, considered useless and die. My parents who are the only people I can honestly say are my only rays of light in this world will not be here forever and realistically will pass away once I am in my late 30s or 40s.I have so much to say and so much to tell but what it all comes down to, is that I am so done. So mentally exhausted Id rope myself if I had the fucking balls to do it which I lack. I cannot destroy my parents and sister like that, the annoying question of but what if it gets better later? in my head which is basically me holding a carrot in front of my own face and the survival instinct to stay alive.I do not know what do.

Those problems were bearable if my physical health was intact.The ""treatments"" just made my health worse and my will to die even bigger. The healthcare staff just wants me dead. They want me as customer after destroying my health? I told them to get lost and that I would never visit them. They will no longer hurt me.Poisonous meds and bad treatment caused me to also lose the relationships I had. Everyone hates me and wants me dead.

Why should I stay alive in my depression and unhappiness just so the people that love me are not sad for a couple months? I have wanted to die for yeeeears but that is okay, so long as people do not have to go to my funeral right. What utter bullshit. what is so great about being alive anyway? Even if I did not have the issues that I have, how can anyone be happy living knowing that millions are living in shit situations. We must stop guilt tripping people into staying alive. We did not ask to be here, I should be allowed to opt out whenever I want to. Being alive is overrated let me go.",1

"A couple weeks ago I hung myself with bedsheets that I jammed into the top of my door frame and tied to the handle on the opposite side.

"Really just writing this for me but maybe some of you relate to it too. Explaining using that Disney movie Inside Out as a metaphor.I do not cut myself for attention the last thing I want is attention. I am shrouded in self hatred so why would I want other people to pile onto that. I cut myself to feel control, to feel like I have a choice in the narrative that I am experiencing. it is the only way I know how.It would be like if the 5 main characters of the movie were living their life but there was also a secret 6th character, repression. He got thrown into that forgotten memories pit but he clawed his way back out holding a grudge. He broke into central control and is holding the other emotions hostage. They are forced to watch him ruin the life they made and cannot do anything about it. They have no control and can only watch what unfolds. They can give suggestions, like go to bed on time or exercise, but he will not take that advice. So finally, to feel some sense of control in this hell, they suggest something he will like. ""Why do not we cut ourselves"" Knowing full well it will just make things worse it is a last ditch attempt at having some relief. And it sucks.That probably did not make any sense at all, idk, sorry. Why I cut myself",0
"Back in April, I was publically humiliated and scarred when the police publically detained me in a crowd of 100s of people and took me to a temporary suicide ward while I awaited a full placement. Many things happened in the week I spent in the temporary placement but I am writing about what happened after.Luckily I was eventually sent home but since that day I have never been able to think the same. Every day I think about the fact I nearly went to (what I have heard from people I know that have been to psych wards) a prison. here is the thing though, you do not get given a set amount of time like prison, it is based on how much progress they think you are making, which gives me 3 things that terrify me.I literally cannot talk to people such as therapists, I have had so many bad experiences with them and I cannot talk to them I hate all of them so much, so they would never see me making any progress, second thing is, I am pretty sure they can force you to take medication, for similar reasons to the therapy thing I hate taking medication, last time I was on an antidepressant-like medication I got 100x worse because of how much I hate it, and the third reason when I am extremely angry, stressed or upset I cannot control myself very well and I do stupid things I regret, if I was in a ward like that I can predict how things would go. I would be told I have to stay for a long time, kick-off or try to run away, get restrained, calm down, get told I now have to say longer because of that, kick-off or try to run away again, get restrained and then told I have to stay even longer and then do this every month for years.it is really fucked me up, every day I think about the fact that if I was not lucky enough to go home I would be stuck there for years if not decades, I would be medicated down to the point where I no longer feel anything, I was specifically told by one of the workers there that it was quote ""Miserable"" and how I would have no phone and visitors are not allowed so I would be completely alone for those years.I have nightmares about being in one of those places, it is horrible. I feel like I have PTSD for something I never even experienced, but just the notion that it might have happened is enough.My feelings about this have been less frequent recently but when I do get them they are still horrible and I hate it I cannot stop thinking about almost being put into a mental ward (Because I would have probably been there for years)",1
"i have not felt this feeling in my chest of sadness since probably late 2020. i do not know why its back. once i accept the fact that i am meaningless, i am replaceable, and that i am not important, i will be able to move on with life and stop overthinking. i do not know what is wrong with me. i went on a trip recently and i had fun but i cannot remember what i felt when i was there. i only have this heavy feeling in my chest. when i try to remember the trip it seems like it was not actually me that went. or it seems like I am watching me live it again like a dream but i never did. and i do not know if i was happy or sad then because all i feel now is sadness. i do not know how to explain it. but its making me feel weird. like I am living but watching myself from the inside sometimes. like sometimes i will laugh or react to something but its not me reacting. its a reflex. i still feel empty inside. and my mind is watching from the inside asking why did i laugh its driving me insane I am over it",0
"I am think I have had it pretty good actually. Nothing seriously terrible has happened to me so far, except for maybe one. I have seriously fucked up several times this year, unknowingly, before it was too late. I cannot get over it, even though I have been told I have come a long way from being that version of me that was constantly fucking up. And everyone around me is suffering so much, and they have real problems to deal with. I get really stuck on that for some reason, I feel like its pathetic that I am so absorbed by misery every single day and not a more happy and successful version of myself. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and say yes this is a real, valuable person I like. I cannot seem to see myself other than this hollow, spoiled she will of a being, whether I am or not. At this point my physical health is starting to slip a bit, I have been drinking more but not eating or sleeping very well. I am not sure where to go.

"These past few years have been aggravating, and now I am just logged off of my social media, pretty much where anyone in real life, knows me in some way. ( No ones about my reddit account).I hate social media. All I see are a bunch of stupid posts. Post that think are funny to those people but they are obviously not to me. I get annoyed at everything. I hate small talk, so when someone, whether it is a random person or someone I know, say some stupid shit like ""hey"" or ""how are you"" I just want to throw my fucking phone out the window. I hate it. I hate talking to people. I was not always like this. I never really had friends (a bff, reliable, etc) in my life so I would be kind of open to try and make new friends, but everytime, something about it just makes not want to hang out with them or talk to, and it is not the introverted side talking, it is the annoyance of that person. Just when you think someone is okay, first impression, over a short period of time, I realize that these people are just not my type to talk to, hang out with, etc. I ghost them because I do not want to talk to, what I think are ""pathetic"" people. I have never told anyone about this kind of hatred except for here, so in their perspective, I am a ""chill"" person. I keep everything bottled up. EVERYTHING including grudges that I could remember since the day I learned to walk. No ones cares about me, no one pays attention to me. So out of the blue and without any thought, I am just logging out of my social media, hiding and deleting content. I hate looking and my class graduates having the time of their life. I hate how when I try to explain something to them, they do not get it or get the actual point of it.All I see is a bunch of stupid people. I know if these see what I typed here, they would think less of me. They already think I am a nobody. I was a nobody in high and I am a nobody now. I hate when people say ""If you need someone to talk to I am right here"" because that is what EVERYONE says. When i do manage to talk to someone, it is just stupid advise, stupid talk, surely they do not understand how I am feeling and what I am going through because they say some shit that does not even relate to it. there is not even a point in get some kind of ""therapy"" talking to someone because I think I am too stubborn to listen to so-called ""advice.""I have always been the quiet person, in school, at home, everywhere. So this post just seems more like a rant than a cry for help. It might be just the symptoms from the withdrawals I had from my antidepressants. I take 75mg of venlafaxine, and my pharmacy fucked up my prescription order so I have been off of them for a good few weeks. I finally got back on them about yesterday. it will take some time for me to calm down now, but when I am on this current medication, I still feel aggravated.My first meds were 10mg of Lexapro, then 20mg lex., then 10mg of Prozac, 37.5mg Effexor XR, now 75mg of Effexor.I am for this post. I am sorry for this stupid rant. Surely I am going to regret this later and feel embarrassed, but I just do not let anything out. I bottle up too much shit. it is hard to talk about stupid feelings and such. Ghosting my social media seems like a great start for me, I have hated it for many reasons.Sorry again. I am 21F. I hate just about everything. I am ghosting social media where people know me.",0

"I have everything setup. I am more ready than ever before.A little background:Couple of months ago I fell into the trap of abusing drugs. Although I abused drugs I were never addicted and it was not hard at all to quit cold turkey. As easy it would be for most people to simply say 'no' to yourself when you have planned to have a 5 mile run the moment you see it is raining outside. However what really been tough for me is to break free from a very abusive relationship. It really sucks. Trauma bonding, Stockholm syndrome, whatever. That was like the battle of my life. But I finally got out and it felt pretty ok. But not anymore though. Throughout the relationship I was gradually becoming more and more isolated from friends/family and that is a thing I *begin* to understand now.Been trying to rebound with old friends but nothing works. I also tried to seek help from them through this tough battle of breaking up, but none of them have reached out to me, not a single one. Even though they know what I have been through. Fuck it really hurts. Anyways, this has truly damaged my self confidence to the degree where I cannot stand up for myself in any circumstances at all. The only one I actually had were my abusive ex, who of course did not like that I broke up. But since it were the only one I could talk to we kept meeting up at times. Not a good idea. The abuse just continued. And if my self confidence was damaged before, it was completely ruined after this. I tried to talk to my family about it, but they refused to understand. Guess they are all narcs/psychopaths. I believe that is the reason I fell for my ex, who definitely have a lot of Cluster-B personality disorder traits. It must be so, that I have people in my family with a cluster-B diagnose. Therefore it were completely normal for me to be gaslit etc. However, my family believe I am 'just depressed'. That freaking hurt me like hell. Fuck! Due to this i.e. that my family believes I am depressed, I have noticed a lot of strange symptoms for me lately such as hard time falling asleep, emotionally numb, having strange smelly farts, being apathetic. I really think they are putting SSRI in my food. I really believe so. 100%. But my lack of self confidence prevents me from confronting them about it. It really kills me slowly alongside the loneliness. The reason I eat the food they make is because I have no income at all and therefore no choice unfortunately. I guess I am just tired to live. it will be better for me to leave this world. Rather than being depressed I do believe I have developed some sort of PTSD after this abusive relationship. Living with PTSD/CPTSD truly sucks. Being lonely truly sucks. The last person I had a conversation +1 hour with was my ex. Roughly 2 months ago. it is time for me to leave this world. I wish you all the best and I know for a fact that you will survive this. Always trust your gut. I failed on this and look where it got me. Complete misery. Good bye! I will do it tonight.",1
"I am 22, in the UK and my depression just keeps getting harder to deal with. I work in a supermarket where I feel overworked and underpaid and that no one cares. I used to earn more before they removed my role. what is the point in life when you cannot afford anything that helps me feel less depressed.I look at new jobs a lot but I cannot actually see myself doing any of them. It makes me feel stupid. I did 1.5 years at uni but I dropped out because of my depression and the pressure, I got to a point I coulmdn't even read my work assignments, let alone study or write. I started anti depressants, over 2 years ago. I do not think they help anymore, or never did. I also have anxiety, especially with talking to doctors.I smoke weed daily because it helps numb it all. When I do not have any my depression gets worse, like right now.I am currently at work and I finish at midnight but all I can think of is being back at home, on the sofa with vaguely interesting content on the TV. it is about the only thing I actually want to do. Everything else I do, I do because I do not have a choice, I have to earn money to be able to have a sofa, TV, computer and the flat.I think I have had depression a lot longer than I initially realised.I do not know what I am doing or where I am going, I am just doing the same thing every day.This just scratches the surface of how I feel.

I found out there is other places to vent where I do not get shitballed. A little about myself: I am 100 percent stuck. In a toxic relationship I can only escape by offing myself or getting kicked out and I have 0 places to go. Suicide is the hardest thing ever. People will say they will do it again and again. I believe I am truly in hell on earth. I absolutely know I am not the only one. I wish people who were not suicidal would stop trolling with useless advice. I have found little commradery here. No comment on Reddit will change shit. Seriously find another hobby. This sub is full of censorship like so many others and yet it is fine to have a Rape Fantasies sub etc. Fuck this and fuck the police. Gee thanks,1
"I was just starting to get into a good groove. I was eating better, exercising, and starting to enjoy my hobbies again. Pre-pandemic, things were not looking all that bad.

"I swear if there were a button to press to just end it immediately Id press itIm just so tired of it all I am just too pussy to do anything about itI have a dog and hes the only thing I am still alive for I am barely socialI do not have real friendsI feel so empty every nightFeeling any type of emotion is almost like a chore, if I am happy Ill just end up sad again so what is the pointwhat the fuck is the point of all this I am tired of feeling emotions",1
I cannot explain how tired I am of feeling this way. I feel like I am trapped. If I commit suicide then all it will do is hurt people. If I stay I will continue to be hurt. When is it supposed to get better,1
"29yo male. Feeling numb and hopeless. My life is not the greatest right now: drifted from friends, single, childless, isolated and alienated, not many prospects - I can only see the darkness in life atm. Might be a trope but the only reason I have not done it yet is that I am very close to my elderly parents, especially my mother (who doted on me; being 'mum' is a large part of her identity) and it would destroy them. Felt down in the past but never like this. Strong antihistamines mixed with a strong megadose opioid is looking more like rest everyday. Not really looking for advice, just felt like talking into the void Feeling suicidal for the first time in my life",1
"I was wondering if anyone knew how bad/painful dying from hypoglycemia is? I have been thinking about how I could best off myself, and thought about insulin.

"I am too tired to type out a full list of events that happened last night. To give you a little bit of background, self-harmer since fourth grade, suicidal thoughts originating in second grade, ASD, OCD, severe depression, SAD, UAD, UMD, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, probable dissociative disorder, way too much fucking joint pain, sexual abuse in second grade, physical abuse kindergarten to grade three, sexual assault in fifth grade, emotional/psychological/verbal abuse dating back to kindergarten. Yeah. My life sucks.Anyways. TLDR for what happened last night: swallowed a tablespoon of hand sanitizer, could not drink any more, nearly threw up, dry heaved, whole head was on fire. Hung myself at home for 35 minutes, face turned lavender purple, passed out for 10 minutes then woke up and decide ""fuck this I am going to bed."" (Was 12:45 a.m. at this point). Took out my gag, which was soaked in alcohol taste, cleaned up the mess, and slept.I think I am going to jump off my balcony on Tuesday. I do not like the odds, it is somewhere from a 10-50% chance of survival (cannot find clear stats), which sucks, but I will take those odds because I am desperate. So yeah. Thanks for reading or whatever.do not give me corny advice. Empathize with me, give me real advice that is not ""seeking help"", validate me, shame me so I can go die, or do not respond at all. Attempted suicide last night. Probably doing it again tomorrow",1
"Okay, I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me: I am short and an ugly man (nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1).Okay, so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with ""What are you going to do?"". Hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon, if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults (or jokes as people call it) I would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height, they are like ""Oh I just cannot take you seriously"" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over, I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying ""NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg"" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as ""Oh gee I do not owe you anything""Now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen, I get told everytime some version of ""you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you *insert physical characteristics* but it is okay do not worry you will find someone"". Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected ""If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?"" And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip: If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out I am becoming what I hate, I hate people who show no emotion, I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts (I can link the study of you folks want).You know what, I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out, I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset, I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me ""just be yourself"" or ""put some effort in"" and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted. Shit my own parents made fun of me.I am tired of pretending I am comfortable I am not. I have no zeal none at all to live. Tired of being belittled constantly.",1

"I hate myself. I do not take care of myself because I hate myself. I do not know how I got like this. Maybe my parents did not teach me its important to love yourself. Maybe the strict Christianity shoved down my throat made me think I have to make everyone else happy instead of myself. do not be selfish. Love thy neighbor. Maybe it was the years of physical, sexual, and mental abuse from my ex. you are just as worthless as I am. No one will ever love you. That is stuck in my brain forever after hearing it every day for years. But I did not care about myself enough even then because I let him do all of that to me. So it started before that. Why is my brain wired like this? Am I destined to kill myself? Sometimes I believe I am. I give out so much love but I cannot love myself. Why? I do not know how to love myself.",1

"I need to say some stuff. I do not need anyone to fix me. I just need people to hear me so that I know I am real. I am 42 next month and I struggle with depression and occasional hypo-mania. It has wreaked havoc on my life. I had some trauma as a very young teen that i was not even able to process until just a year or two ago. I started using drugs when i was a teen. I got clean at 22 and worked really really hard to rebuild my life. I graduated from Arizona State with a 4.0 perfect gpa in marketing in 2005. I took a dream job in Minnesota. But I knew nobody there. It was cold and gray. The depression came back and for the first time i started to feel the pain of lonliness. I went through a period of rapid cycling moods: Id be so depressed I could not move for days at a time. Then id feel great and think I am going to do big things. I thought i wanted to start a candy company and raise a million dollars etc. Eventually it all became too much and i quit my once in a million job and moved home to AZ. I ended up losing everything and starting over at zero. I rebuilt a career in behavioral health, lost everything, built a successful business selling modems. I made one million dollars in sales in 2013. Declared bankruptcy in 2014. The depressuin comes and wipes everything out. I rebuild. It happens again. A year ago, i had a good corporate job. I owned a house that was $38,000 from paid off. Somehow through a series of starry eyed confidence of hypo mania and excrutiating lows of depression i ended up selling my house, losing the money, losing my job. Also, i should note that i became addicted to narcotics in 2012 after an accident. It happens with the depression. Drugs. Because i literslly cannot stand the pain and its numbness or death. But i fought back. I got clean in July 2014 on my own. It took me several years but i pulled myself together, got back to a job, etc. Once again, i was at zero, less than that actually. I built up again. But when i quit drugs i also left my circle of acquaintances. And i never quite got a footing in my new life. It took me 3 years just to be recovered enough to function in society. And last February was the time. I started getting out. I went on a couole dates. I had decided to *look* for my future. Then COVID came. Lost my job and was not able to get unemployment because i quit my job due to severe depression. I lost my house. I tried to invest and screwed that up. Now I am staying at my moms. I have nothing and nobkdy. My work history is spotty. My marketing degree is from before social media. I have no remarkable skills despite being intelligent. I make terrible decisions. I do not know what to do. I do not have a single foothold, nothing to leverage. I literally know nobody but my mother. The lonliness is so bad i have sat in my room scresming crying because it hurts so bad. Physically. Its worse than any pbysical agony I have ever felt. Its like my soul is being suffocated. I do not beling to any groups. I am not christian and do not feel comfortable in chruches. I do not know anybody. I have no job, no job skills, no money, no savings, no plan, no confidence, no hope. I feel like the tree in the forest that falls and nobody hears it. Did it make a noise? Did it even fall? Did it even exist? If i dissapeared tomorrow, other than my mother the world would not notice. I am outside of society. I am nothing. I often start to question if i even really exist because no part of the world sees me. I do not want to die. I am not going to kill myself. But i wake up every day amd think dammit. Dammit! I have to do this again. I have been crying most the day for a week or two. I am terrified. If something happened to my mom id be on the streets. This is not supposed to be my life. I hate it. Every mome t i wosh i would dissapear because i cannot do it. I do not want to rebuild again. I do not want to do it because its so painful and hard and every time it just goes away anyways. I have never been able to reach stability i my life. I have hurt people around me so much. I feel like i only am a burden and a dissapointment. I have never had a healthy relationship or one lasting longer thhan a couple months. Since i was burt as a teen and the house i grew up in i never had love modeled for me. I do not know what it means, how to give it, recognize it, or receive it. I have spent 30 years just wishing so much for a shoulder rub. Sometimes i go months without a hug or touching a person. I am dying from lonliness. And from lack of hope. My teeth are bad. I had planned to use money from selling my hosue for dental inplants but the money is gone. I am not sure i could even get a job with them like they are. I certainly cannot date. And i cannot fix them. I do not even have money to have the ones rotting in my gums pulled. I see no path. I am without hope. And so lonely it fucking feels like cruel torture. I do not want to kill myself. I do not want to die. But i feel like I am slready dead and it hurts like watching a child die. All of my hopes and dreams for my future. I cannot. I cannot I do not know what to do or where to start. I have nothing and nobody and i just want to have never happened. A tree falls...",0
"My mood swings affect me so much. I would not say i fluctuate between happy and depressed, but rather neutral calm and suicidal anxiety. It seems weird to even put it that way considering I used to be incredibly hyperactive. But nowadays, perhaps due to the landscape of covid19 and the incompetent handling of the situation by the Government, adding on to the fact i have nothing going on much in my life (which i may stress may be due to the lack of motivation from these mood fluctuations too). I know it is not good to put the blame on your mental health but it does have a part to play. Currently i am seeking mental health treatment in my school counselling program, with an upcoming one this Wednesday. These depressed feelings usually hit when i am alone or at home. I do not particularly enjoy being at home. Coping slowly",0
"I do not do shit anyway, I just lie in bed all day trying to find something to watch to keep me distracted from all the pain. I have no motivation to eat or do anything basically. have lost everything good I have ever had in my life and there is no going back.

"So, I have never been a very sexual person, but I still watched porn from time to time, even when majorly depressed. Now even that does not excite me anymore. People I had small crushes on do not do it for me anymore. Watching porn reminds me of the fact that sex is so readily available for so many people, but not for me. I am actually sad when I watch it now.I am a hopeless romantic, I am in love with the idea of being in love, but I have given up on even attempting to find it. I am ugly and depressed, who would want me? This is actually serious",0
"COVID gave me a nice break from uni for a while. It was nice since my mom passed away recently and I wanted to process. But the thought of going back now makes me think about killing myself. I have some really good friends from high school but everyone at uni is so awful and I hate everyone there and they make it so hard to exist and god I do not want to work with any of them I just want to die.And then just the thought of actually doing work again sounds awful, I feel so useless but I just cannot understand this course properly, and it is all messed up because of COVID.This year has been awful and I do not know if I will ever be able to get paid work because I am so dumb.I am just sitting on the couch thinking about how I should die. I get overwhelmed by the dumbest things",1
"I have been to therapy, treatment for self-harm, depression, violent tendencies, suicidal urges. I have tried affirmations, new routines, pursuit of interests, and making friends.Therapy put me into debt for years longer than I attended. Months of positive affirmation practice just made me hate positive phrases and platitudes. No perceived difference in various routines, I still live every day either on the verge of a panic attack or drowning myself in distractions like movies and books. I spent twelve years pursuing various interests and that just revealed to me how much of a fucking talentless idiot I am. My friends are all good people, they invite me to their events and treat me like one of them, but interacting with them feels like a waste of time. Every time I think that I realize just how much of an asshole I really am.I used to love my job. Prided myself on work ethic above all else. Really loved that Jocko Willink line about Navy Seals cleaning toilets. For years, I greeted my coworkers with a smile and a compliment. Worked longer hours than anyone else in a high speed, high stress environment. Dealt with toxic people with sunshine and rainbows. And in my free time, I would write. Of everything I pursued, writing brought me meaning.I am tired. I cannot remember how I cared so much before. I thought I would already been through the darkest time in my life. I have gotten away from my petty family, but the panic attacks will not stop. I cannot sleep unless I stay active until the point of total exhaustion, because if I spend a minute with my eyes closed all I can see is every way I have failed at everything I do. I have ruined every relationship I have ever had. Everything that has ever gone wrong in my life is clearly and obviously my fault.I do not see a way this gets better from here. I am too old for someone to take pity on, which is how I have gotten even this far in life. I am not attractive, intelligent, wealthy, or even financially stable. Writing, the one practice that delayed me committing suicide years ago, more often than not leaves me feeling worse than ever as I desperately seek that state of flow before I freeze up and start chewing on my fingers.I am amused that I feel that same state of flow while writing this, sifting through memories that at any other time would leave me a cringing nervous wreck. it is been 3 months since I last felt it. I cannot wait that long again.I cannot let anyone down again. I wish someone would just be angry with me for screwing up. But that would not fucking matter anyway. I am not mature enough to accept criticism.I do not want to put up with my bullshit anymore. I just want it to stop.",1
"I am so fucking jealous of people with families that actually love each other. i could not feel less distant from mine, and i literally live with them. sometimes i hate myself for it and remind myself that when I am older and move out and they are old and dying that I would regret not spending enough time with them .. sometimes i just wished they would die now so i do not need to feel guilty later on .. does that make me a bad person? my mom is bipolar and my most vivid memories of my childhood are visiting her at mental hospitals or watching her have some manic episode. but i love her, so much. she is the only reason i am still alive because i know if i would die that she would go completely insane. whenever i mention moving out or college to her she gets so sad and tells me that i cannot leave her .. once i just joked about going somewhere and for the rest of the day she kept on bringing it up and asking me why i said that and that i can never leave her .. i really wonder what it would be like to have a normal mom she does not do anything like a normal mom would. she does not care that I am visibly depressed, never eat, never go outside, etc .. she does not care. i try to tell her so much, my doctor told her to call a psychrasict.. but she fucking will not because its too expensive and she thinks I am too young to be sad.. I am 16 ..my dad is the same. i feel like i have to literally slit my wrists till they visibly bleed out or try to kill myself so they feel guilty that they did not pick up on all the signs before. my brother is an asshole and people say that trauma brings siblings closer but i feel like i do not even know him. hes a complete stranger to me. i still care about him though because i feel bad for all the shit my dad put him too .. and i wish he cared about me even a little bit but i know he does not. hes so fucking rude to me and my mom, hes physically abusive, and just so god damn annoying. i literally have nobody in here and i feel so fucking lonely all the time. i have like 2 friends but our friendship is broken and they have their own families to keep them comfort. i have nothing and no reason to continue living for. i always talk about how much i want to die .. but i can never do it .. i cut but i cannot just kill myself .. i wish i could, or i wish a car would hit me or id die some really fast way so it can all be over. the thought of death calms me down and whenever i feel stressed about my future or anything .. i tell myself that I will be dead before than so it does not matter .. i can kill myself and all of this will go away and nothing will matter why did i have to be born into this family",1
"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life",0

"All I want is to fall in love and have a happy life with someone. I do not want items or wealth really. A stable living, sure, but no extravagance needed. Literally all I want is for someone to love me how I want to be loved. I have been in four major relationships and they have all been SO amazing. No drug on the earth has felt so good. But I have ruined every one of them. Its like I cannot even control myself. The narcissism runs so deep I do not know what I have even done or said until I sleep and when I wake up I feel like an absolute pos. And eventually the apologies run thin and finally they leave. I do not want to be this way. But I always have been. I hate myself so much. I am 30 now and felt like this last woman was the one. she is now gone too. I am in such a deep hole. I just cry randomly throughout the day. I cannot be alone but no one wants to be with me after a year of dating usually. I think I am hopeless and really want to just blow my head off.

"A few days ago I was fully at peace with my decision to commit suicide and I had a full plan, a set date (or general time) a little after summer, I even started drafting my note long story short I am a very planned-out person. (I was waiting for after summer because I did not want to ruin everyone is summer lol. Suppose it does not matter because Id be hurting them anyways, but, so be it.)Anyways, fast forward to the weekend and I am suddenly going over things in my head: am I being dramatic? What will I be missing if I do this? I almost forgot why I was suicidal/it seemed very nearly trivial. But the thing is its not trivial. Its a culmination of sufferances which I am not going to go over here, but I am sure you understand. And now I am just pissed. there is so much of the world that Ill be leaving, and so much damage I may because, but even so I cannot live like this and I do not want to. I can dream about a good life, but I know realistically I will never move past my issueand that is not me saying that because every depressed person says it, it genuinely is a very unique set of internal problems that I cannot work around. Moreover I just do not want to be a part of the world anymore. I feel like I do not deserve to be. When I first felt suicidal, I was so excited and I had this euphoric peaceful feeling wash over meId finally be dead and nothing could get to me. I felt like Duncan from Macbeth. But these stupid caveman survival instincts are really deathblocking me, so to speak. Ugh. Part of me wishes I could overcome my second thoughts and just get it over with, another part tells me they are there for a reason. Anyone else have this?

I have failed in all aspects. i could not even kms properly. there is literally no reason to live. there is no reason to even be posting this, actually. my parents do not care about me, my siblings do not care about me, i have no irl friends, and I am pretty sure my online friends do not care about me either. why would they? there is literally nothing good about me. i do not even want a reason to live anymore. i do not want to get better. i want to die. my therapist is great. i appreciate him loads, but getting better is so hard and it just does not feel worth it. and anyway, what is the worst that can happen? i survive? with severe brain damage? i will not even be fucking aware. ill write dnr on the wall or something so they cannot do anything. i wish id done it ages ago. i cannot believe i actually thought things might improve. considering posting on /r/roastme so ill feel even worse and it will make me want to do it even more, except i do not want to show my face, because I am fucking ugly. either that or I am taking to twitter rand say something mildly controversial like spiders are not that bad. i know ill get attacked, because last time i was on twitter (over a year ago) i said one thing (what?) and got death threats. i wish someone would just kill me. i hope i get hit by a car, or fall onto train tracks, or get pushed off a high bridge, or get stabbed, or get caught in a fire. its so unfair. and i do not want to hear bUt liFe is not fAiR. i know. everyone does. and its not helpful. its so unfair that some people do not want to die and yet die. I have got everything i need to go through with it, i guess right now I am just looking for something. anything really, good or bad, i do not fucking care. i just want to fucking die",1
"If I become inactive in Reddit, it means I have moved to another life already.I have 200 dollars in my wallet, and since I look like a grown up, I plan to hitch a hike to [ tall building, will not tell where]. Get permission to go on top of building, and fall off.I imagine that when I am falling, it would be the most euphoric moments of my life, its the end, I will not have to deal with bullshit anymore.

I have realized that I have no reason to keep going. there is no point trying to feel better if I just go back to being suicidal. Everything I have tried I failed at. it is been the same cycle for 8 years. So I figure it is just time to go. No one will care if I die anyway. I may call it quits soon.,0

"I have said on here before I deal w/ depressive episodes. Well, I am still going through it, its not the worst its been, though. I still have my job, I have a great family, and I have my boyfriend. As to why I feel this way, I do not know, and that is what is hard. Last night, it all hit me when I thought to myself I have been thinking about wanting to die a lot lately that I think its unhealthy now. I cried myself to sleep, and woke up feeling a tiny bit better. My parents know I have dealt with this multiple times in the past, but they do not know as of right now. I do not want to tell my boyfriend what I am going through because I do not want him to view me as pathetic, or that I am suicidal maniac. Idk. (I have not told him i deal with depression at all). I do not want to worry my parents, or have them ask why do you feel this way? Because Ill have no answer. I always get up and get myself ready, go to work and work my hardest, and act happy with my co workers. I am doing something right because my manager said I was one of her top workers there. On my days off, I make it a point to sit outside and draw, or play with my cat, or simply just enjoy nature. This is so frustrating, I just want to not have this dread around me at all anymore. I always try to distract myself from this feeling and keep myself busy, but it will not go away. I know it will get better, but I want it to get better now. I am tired of this. I am young , I am 18, I have so much to live for. Should I keep this bottled up till it all passes like it always does?.. I have hope, but its been hard.",0
"I HATE THIS! Life was never easy and it is never going to get easy, but why? Why in the fucking world does my love life have to be the way it is? Sometimes I wish I could be a normal guy who could have crushes, fall in love, and have no issues with anyone. I never wanted issues with anyone. God, I rather die than have another crazy ex. Everything is stressful enough, I failed school, I can barely take care of myself, I cannot clean my room or do anything that actually matters. I wish I was never born. I wish I could stop causing problems. I just did not want to be alone. I do not want to be all alone. I do not know what the fuck to do with myself anymore. I NEVER asked to be alive",1
"I know that many people do not recognize this term 'NEET' It stands for currently 'Not in Education, Employment or Training'. People think that you are lazy and all that but who cares we just sit at home play games watch movies and surf the internet, and are not willing to study or go out or get to work. If this feels similar and then do not stop reading I was not aware of the fact a few years back too I am 23 years old from India and this country is not japan so they mostly do not know about it because They do not watch a lot of anime and they do not know about this term 'NEET' so her's my story like back in 2017 I guess I dropped out of college and my life set back 360 degree I was a fun party-loving college fresher then how I became a Shut-in NEET ? that I also do not have an answer. Now I have Agoraphobia and some symptoms of schizophrenia to I was not diagnosed but I can tell my situation very well I tried jobs and work from home could not stay for much longer, how long I will say less than a month I do not know what is going to happen in my future that is uncertain and it is been four fucking long years and thanks to Covid people did not ask about me a lot for the past 2 years it is been 5 years since I became a NEET every day is like a Groundhog Day- Eat, Sleep,Repeat I do not how much longer I will live.

"The job search, working, interviewing, sharing too much. Not preparing well enough. Feeling desperate and not being able to conceal it. I know I am worthless, went do I have to go through this process that just emphasizes it?And do not give me that bullshit that no one is worthless, because yes, the world is mostly filled with worthless people.I have gone back to school twice.I have been through therapy.And I have nothing to show for it.And I simply do not want to do something I am just going to fail at because I always do.My wife is going through a hard time too, but I just do not want to deal with it anymore.I wish I had a significant amount of money. So I could just buy a small studio somewhere, work a phone center job and wait to die.But I am ""over qualified fort phone center jobs"".So whatever I guess, this existence cannot end fast enough.

I really want to kill my self. Dealing daily with mental illness and bulimia is taking a toll on me. Life is exhausting And I am in so much pain. I think I might be pregnant which is adding to this despair. I want my life to end but I am too scared to do it.Help. I really want to kill myself.,1
"I opened up to my friend and talked to my therapist.They both asked me what kind of thing i needed for them to help. They asked me if i just needed someone to listen, to give advice, to distract, etc... And honestly i had no idea what to say. Idk what i need or want.If someone asked you what you needed, what did you say or what did someone do that you did not expect but found helpful? When you open up to someone about your depression, what do you want them to do to help you?",0

Today I woke up and just felt so fucking horrible. Like I have many times. I feel so ugly and I cannot stop thinking about my life and if I am even making the right decisions. I feel like I am doing nothing useful. I am not in college. I do not know if I ever want to go. I could not tell you what I would want to study. Throughout high school I always hoped Id figure out what path Id like to take. And now I have been out of high school for a year and I still have no clue. I do not feel like I am good enough for anything. I also feel shitty because I am in a position of making a decision where neither path feels completely right. I am currently living with my long distance boyfriend. But at the end of this month I go back to my home. States away. I am not sure if Id feel completely happy moving here permanently. And I am not sure he would not be lonely if he moved to me. I love him and I wish being together was easier. I realize these are all normal things to worry about. But today they just feel crushing. And I am not sure Ill know the right answer to them. Major low after feeling good for a month.,0
"Everyone has their ups and downs. Everyone goes though good and bad days however I had realized that I am missing something more. I have been feeling like even though I am told that I am heard, it feels like quite the opposite. I have been feeling misunderstood for as long as I remember and its catching up to me. I almost have no communication with my parents, all of my friends are busy with life and my girlfriend of 2 years just left me a couple of days ago because I exhausted her which is true and I need to find myself and I have to settle things with me. I have been lacking motivation for the past few years, there is nothing that I feel inspired by, nothing that drives me and I feel like I am just another person that awaits his time to go. I have had suicidal thoughts before, this time they scare me and I guess I am here not asking for help because I can only help myself but more so to see how those of you that have/are feeling that way coping with it and what is it that you are holding on to.Thank you for reading.

"Living to ~80 seems bewildering, am I just going to suffer that long?? Really, how much better can I get at this point, and how much worse? Feels like rock bottom every week, and this week it is every day. And every time I feel better, it gets all the way back down again.Wish I was not too weak to cut successfully. And it would crazy because I would never think that about someone else. But me? Lol yeah I feel like such a wimp. I am shutting down, and i have important stuff to do today. Fuck this. Honestly. I wish I could kill myself, obviously I cannot and I am angry at myself because I will not. it is stupid. I am suffering all the time anyway. I had night terrors again last night, for the first time in a while. It fucking sucks, it affects you physically. Why cannot it actually just kill me for real, this is so fucked up. I hate it here. I hate this life, this earth, this existence, this body, i hate it. I hate when people are jealous of me too because it is like bitch i really have nothing, there is nothing to be envious over. I am just living a pathetic existence honestly. Fucking horrible honestly I did self harm for the first time in a while, and I have been really good about it before now.

"I did not cryed in over 3 years now, until today, my heart is so broken right now that I just want to die no matter what happens then, even if my not caring mom crys, I do not care, I have seen enough to just end it right here and now, even though I am just 18 years old. Nothing feels real anymore, It feels like I am going crazy. My thoughts are depressing all the time, playing games does not bring me joy, and even listening to music is not the same as it was before, it just drags me down.I look out of my window and see the city lights, the empty streets and the night sky.it is beautiful but I am scared, I could jump out and nobody would notice till morning.I am thinking about killing others but I do not want to, my brain constantly tell me to do horrible things, I do not want this.i regret more and more things i have done before, even if it is not true, i was and am only a burden for the people around me. Meanwhile, the last person I was friends with has left me, he was my best friend, we did so much shit together and experienced so much.I am completely alone, have no one to tell me that I am important to them, no one who takes me in their arms or is just there for me, absolutely no one.I hardly mind it anymore because I am used to it now, but anyway.The only thing that might keep me from killing myself is my sister, she means a lot to me but we are too far away to see each other.she also has problems, i want to help her so that she does not have to go through something like I am going through or worse.I am sorry for everyone who read through the complet, it was just a waste of time anyway.why should anyone care.i thought i could escape from this hole, from this hell, but i was wrong, the more i try, the further away i get from the edge.....I am sorry again that this text is so long and that I wasted your time my tears have never tasted so salty",0
"So yeh. Basically that. I feel like a shadow of who I was prior to the bad things that happened to me with the man I love..... I feel like a she will with a heartbeat :( every feeling and thought is something that hurts. Or I just fall into the pit of not even being able to accept that this is my life, I will lay in bed and I cannot even explain it - I detach from myself and stare into space for even a minute of peace... . Its only brief though because reality always pops into my head again, My heartbeat reminds me I am alive but its a shame really because I am not exactly living my life anymore. Just sort of surviving it . And I do not want it to be that way . I wanted so badly for this summer to be a happy one, it should have been special but yeh.

"I am having trouble sleeping so I thought I would just vent hereI just graduated from junior college, and now have to serve a compulsory 2 years in the army. So now is the time for me to think about what I want to study in universityJunior College really burned me out, and I do not feel really passionate about anything other than comics and film. I have tried to reignite an interest in coding, but I just feel so uninterested and defeated.The reason why I particularly like film is because you get to create content in our increasingly consumerism-centric society. I also want to work on comic adaptations, because I just love these storiesMany people in life, they encourage you to chase your passion, and I want to, but I feel like work experience is much more useful to get myself into the film industry. I seriously have little faith in the film school route, what if I spend 3-5 years getting a film degree and still struggling to find a job, especially in my country where the film industry is tinyAlso, since the film industry here is so tiny, coming across opportunities to work in the film industry after my 2 years of army service...seems hardI just feel so empty. My only real passion in life now is comics and film. I do not have that many friends to share joy withAnd I am just sad I feel empty, not very interested in almost all career options. Only really interested in film. Yeah.",0
"I have not been this depressed in a long time and I have no idea how to cope. I feel guilty and humiliated. I have not been able to have an orgasm without crying or feeling disgusting since the SA( It happened fairly recently. ). Idk how to feel like myself again.

"I have tried before, failed. Spent a week or so in a mental hospital while on active duty, ostracized and shit on by my ex wife while I was in the hospital. My whole life I had to watch my own back, growing up extremely poor in ghettos and around abusive people hoping my father would swoop in and save me one day but that never happened. Sexually abused by someone I thought I could trust when I was in grade school, I still cannot remember all the details because my brain will not let me, at least that is what my therapist explained to me and idk if that is good or bad. Gave my life and all of my love to my ex wife, only to have constant infidelity while on deployment but I still loved her, she FaceTimed me on my last deployment.... of her viciously punching her womb while in the 2nd trimester with our child. I had to watch her kill our child while trying to beg her to stop, then offer sympathy to her when I found out the kid was officially lost, but I was still the bad person. I would let her beat on me because I thought it was the right thing to take it like a man. My career was flushed because I tried to give her everything, I was damn good at my job too. I forgot how to function and began drinking a lot. I have failed at everything I tried to do in my life, if not at first a bit later. I was in therapy while still in, but after I got out that all went down the drain. Its been almost 2 years since I separated and I look nothing like I used to, a pile of sweaty shit that did not do anything but drink and get high to numb myself. I have been sober for a couple weeks which I should be proud of but now I think about offing myself even more. 9mm to my temple, easy off switch. The only reason I saw fit to keep living was to take care of my grandmother, but she is ok now and does not need me anymore. My mother died last October on her birthday, she froze to death in her own apartment. I was ignoring her because I could not handle her mental issues, what kind of piece of shit does that. She needed me. I am a jobless pos that does not know how to function in society, and I do not think I could ever handle a relationship again. I do not know who to talk to that would believe all of this and not look at me like yeah, okay buddy. I am not even sure why I am writing this. I hate myself more for whining about my problems. I am so tired of pretending to happy.. my thoughts and talking about my issues makes me feel like a crazy person, reality at times seems permanently warped, sometimes I feel like I succeeded and I am just living in some sort of fucked up purgatory. I have never been good enough for anyone, just a waste of space. The stuff anyone likes about me is a lie because I am pretending to be happy. Just a washed up pos vet, I do not feel deserving of that title either. This post is all over the place and I have no idea what I am trying to say or why I am even doing it. What is the fucking point of living, I have nothing meaningful to offer to anyone. I wish someone would kill me so my family would not have to deal with the memory of me doing it to myself. I am tired of living with my memories, so much fucked up shit I can never escape. But I do have signs of liver failure so hopefully that pans out and ends up killing me soon. It seems like just a matter of time.",1

"I am currently feeling like it would be easier to take my ow life than carry on. My wife and I have recently agreed to separate. We also have two young girls aged 5 and two. The thought of not seeing them everyday is breaking my heart. I also feel like a failure. I suspect I may have Narcissistic Personality Disorder as my wife recently pointed out that I possess several of the relevant traits: I am highly sensitive to criticism, regularly have fantasies of success and, whilst I believe I can and do empathise with others, I am starting to question whether I do this simply because this is what good person would do. I also have very low self-esteem. With little-to-no idea of what I can do to improve this, I am feeling trapped and as though Ill never be able to improve my mood, make new friends, enjoy a normal social life, etc. Happiness just feels like a mystery; something I can neither understand or comprehend. It feels like too much right now",1

I am thinking about killing myself tonight. I am nothing and have nothing at all. I live in Iran the third world. My talents were not known and I studied in one of Iran's best universities.

All of my peers seem to be interested in different things but I cannot find anything in common with any of them, because there is nothing interesting about me (I am also socially awkward big time so that does not help). Its so difficult for me to find friends and form romantic relationships. Like I said there is nothing interesting about me, I have got no skills (a couple hobbies maybe but I am not good at them). In addition to that I am not that attractive. My meds have made it hard to manage my weight and my face is just 4/10, if I am being generous. It just feels unfair compared to all the attractive girls who attend my school. I know what people say, that its good to be different.

"For the last couple of days or a week ago my mental state starts to wavering. I have a habit of bottling things, and I am incredibly ashamed of not being functional nor useful. My partner, knowing that one of my episodes was coming up, tried his best to be there, comforting me, and given me a reality check. The more he cares, the more I am ashamed of being so low and useless. It was also a coincidence where we decided to stay an entire night through to restart our bio-clock (due to us being night-owls, its an eventual fact that we would end up waking somewhere between 3-5pm before) and also taking care of packing and preparations for university. The morning after making the night through I had an embarrassing panic attack while in a crowded open market. My boyfriend was beyond amazing at handling the mess that was me, and it helped for quite a bit. However, my mood soon went down again, with a phone call from my sibling broke me to my end. I became a leech, refusing to tell my bf what is wrong, getting irritated when he tries to show me something (we were playing chess), and overall I was trying my best to not makes him more worried, with that backfired horrendously. My bf end up getting sick of my misery, said he tried everything but nothing worked, and he is beyond drained. I started getting angry and spiral even harder, thinking that I was right for bottling myself up, to not share my problems because of the damage I made. When I saw that he threw the chessboard in the trash, something snapped. I self-harmed, weeping for apologies, and upon seeing that I was only a nuisance, wanted to flung myself out of the balcony. that is the kind of things a 17 years old girl would do, and besides we live on the 4th floor, so you will not die. Also I have to clean the mess (my corpse or blood) afterwards, and I really do not want to. There is the next building which you can jump off from the 7th floor, and if you want I can walk you to there, but I am not cleaning the mess up. quote from my bf, which he is right. That unfortunately makes me spiral even harder, feeling like a defected tool, and must be eradicated. Afterwards, even now I am trying to find a suitable cleaning group, so my bf will not need to clean up my mess if I did end up jumping. I am now in an ultimatum where if I leave the bedroom or from his sight, its a clean breakup. I am still confused why he is more upset when I said he does not need to take care of anything, he does not need to clean my mess. At the end, the two nights to restart our bioclock was a failure, my bf is burned out entirely and it was my fault and my unnecessary drama. I am sitting here fighting in my head in shame a guilt, trying to not kill myself. But knowing that problems, nuisances and burdens need to be eradicated, so everyone around me (including my bf) would be happy again I am constantly crying and trying not to kill myself.I am not sure if he would break up with me, and I will not blame him if he does, but I am desperately need to be the functional and hard working gf again, or I have to eradicate myself for good to contain the failures and burdens from spreading again to my bf.Long story short, shitty depressive gf bothers her bf to the mac with her pretentious suicide attempt.

"Seems once the antidepressant builds up in my system it just makes my productivity worse. Before meds I would have bad days and good days with most days being a mix but on meds it just seems to dull the highs and the lows and I am just in a consistently low state. All I would have to do in the past is wait for the depressive period to pass but now I just feel so out if it. I went from things having little satisfaction to them nearly having none, it made me cut some bad habits but I have no motivation for anything now. I lost interest in music, video games, social media and more. On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different, not better. I have tried sertaline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine. I am assuming raising Sert is making my dopamine drop making my apathy worse. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. Feeling worse on medication",0

"I suppose I have made an inch of progress since I have last felt the need to post here. My current job has been extraordinarily stressful for a long time. I have known for months, if not over a year, that I need to find somewhere else. Yet despite knowing that, I would get so scared about the thought of applying somewhere else, about having to go through the process of putting in that two weeks notice.So that was my situation. Too scared to hunker down and take care of the things that would make my current job better, yet too scared to push forward.My situation is not much different, but I have that inch of progress I have made in the past few weeks. I finally managed to get myself to apply to some other places. Only two so far, but maybe I can find some more. Or maybe I get lucky and I will hear back from one of these.Just going slow. I do not want to end up at a job that will make me feel the same, or potentially even worse, than I do now.I wish I was not going slow. I fantasize in my head that I will just hear back immediately from one of these jobs I have just applied to and I will be out of here. But these things take time, and as much as I wish it was not like this, I will probably need to apply to more than two places.I suppose I am not actively suicidal, but have been engaging in some reckless behavior. I do not really want to but after not putting in the effort to progress out of here I am tired and feel the need to cope in shitty ways.Just want out of here. Wish I would just quit. I have plenty saved but I just get concerned about having trouble getting a new job if I quit one out of the blue. that is my irrational brain, so concerned about keeping a job I would drive myself to an unintentional suicide, maybe intentional if it gets worse.Guess I got to just fight for that next inch of progress. Apply some more places and get the hell out of here. Change cannot come fast enough",1

I just finished a master's degree program in library science, and now have 120k+ in debt. I also just had open heart surgery, from which I am recovering. I have no friends. I have someone in my life who pitied me enough to give me a place to stay during my first ten days of recovery, as it seems the doctors insisted that I not be alone. I have been alone since my father died nearly ten years ago. I have no siblings or family. Maybe 1 cousin who might give enough of a shit to she would a tear when they find out I have checked out of this mad-house asylum they call the world. I have no children, obviously. I do not have any one who would miss me. I cannot remember the last time one of my friends called. I have tried to reach out, but everyone has their own lives, and not much time to spend on old friends. I do not tell anyone or let on that I want to die. I am not big into drama. The hospital asks their routin questions, but I always deny any sucidal thoughts, as I am not going to let them institutionalize me or put me on some list where I cannot get the firearm that will get me out of this hell. So I sit and I think about this every day. I should have not even bothered to call the fucking ambulance when I started to have angina pains. The result was an emergency bypass. I wish I would have died on that fucking table. It would have been painless. Now I am stuck with this shit and no prospects of a job. I have not even had a job in nearly 2 decades. I am looking at exit bags, but that seems like a lot of work. I think I am just going to get a sleeping bag and a gun. The sleeping bag will at least make clean-up easy for the landlady, who seems nice enough. there is no fucking point to any of this, and I have finally realized that I have to do it. I am going to set things in motion since there is a 2 week waiting period for the gun. Kind of sucks that i have to wait two weeks. I hope my resolve does not waiver. there is nothing left for me at this point. do not look at me as an example to emulate. My life is shit and I clung to hope in the face of hopelessness. You each have to decide your own fate. I have hopefully decided mine. Peace. 55 Y/O Male. No friends, no family, recovering from triple bypass. Probably going to be checking out voluntarily soon.",1
"I am so done. I have to deal with my parents constantly breaking down my confidence that I am trying to work on and being VERY mentally abusive. I get comments about my weight, my intelligence, my clothing style, my actions, etc. I cannot even breath without being judged. my parents like to twist the word ""respect"" so i get treated like shit but then I have to walk on eggshells when I am around them. it is not like I am a bad kid. I have A's/B's, planning for college, never get into any trouble, yet I am constantly ridiculed like I am the worst kid in the world. Then I have my friends where recently they have been judging me as well for multiple things. They make my parents sound like they are ""the best and chillest parents ever"" when they have NO idea what happens behind closed doors. I have ADHD and anxiety and one of the things that I do is that I cannot function if my hands are dry so i carry around lotion with me. EVERY time i would take out the lotion they would give me a weird look. They also like to call me out on a lot of things or call me names just at random and it does not help my already not very mental state. My one friend has called me a 'pig' before on multiple occasions and always has to point out my SH scars and call them 'tic tac toe' like its some sort of joke when all it does is make me want to cut again. I am trying so hard to work on myself and work on my confidence but I feel like I am suffocating. OH also to mention I have found out alcohol causes my spiraling thoughts to temporarily go away so now I am trying not to start an addiction to either SH or Alcohol but I have no one to fucking help me or be there for me without having that feeling of being judged. I also had my girlfriend try to hurt herself and her homophobic parents found out about us so now I have not heard from her for over 2 weeks. I am trying to cope with everything and no one even seems to care. I am just a fucking kid yet I feel like everyone is treating me like I should know how to fix every single problem I have. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me it is going to be okay. I want that embrace of a hug that makes me feel like all my problems have gone away. I want help. I want to be happy like how I was when I was younger. Why did I have to grow up so fast. I am done with constant mental abuse",0
About a year I made a huge mistake and I honestly cannot move on from it. I have really bad anxiety everyday and I just beat myself up for it every single day.I hate myself so much for it. I cannot move on,1
"Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post.As english is not my native tongue, I will do my best to be as clear and concise as possible.About three months ago, I celebrated my 31st birthday. The day after when I woke up, I felt some sort of fatigue. I thought it was nothing to worry about and I decided to sleep it off. The next day I felt the same but I began to be very anxious about what was going on in my system. I though I had all the diseases in the world and that I was on the verge of dying. Then, as I was trying to fix something on a relative's computer, I could not use the trackpad and I thought that I was going crazy. I then had this very hard to describe panic attack where my heart raced and I began to see weirdly. I felt so disconnected and I my mind was everywhere at once. It took about 30 min to finally calm down. I explained what was going to my relatives and they suggested I see a healthcare professional.I was prescribed a series of blood tests. Everything came back fine but my bad cholesterol was just a smidge high. I was then put on Seroquel, that was the worst thing I have ever done to myself. Every morning, I would wake up feeling like a Zombie and I had this constant vertigo and fatigue. It was horrible. Then I switched to Zoloft (which is what I am taking, at 50mg) and all the fatigue, vertigo, headaches and muscle pain went away. I am still feeling anxious to this day but it has been manageable so far.Now I am dealing with a very hard to describe problem. I feel like since this event, I am not back to my ""normal"" and I am afraid I do not even remember what was ""normal"" like for me. I feel like I am about to lose control and just go crazy. Like I am controlling it, but I always feel on the edge of being able to not continue to control it. it is very hard to describe I am sorry. Also, I feel like I am not myself, like if I am not connected to this world and that even though I know I can see with my eyes, I feel like I am somewhere else and like if being in my body is a lie.I have done some reasearch on this, at it looks to be called depersonalisation/derealisation. This reddit post explains quite well how I am feeling : [ keep on having these existential questions. Like what happens after death? Why me, In my body, why born in 1990, why in America, why in this universe? What was before this universe? Why living if dying is only option? Are we living a universe with multi-verses and with higher dimensions? Are we just a few milimeters big and there is something out there so much bigger than the universe and we are just like an ant on a log? What if tomorrow, there is this big black hole somewhere in a distant galaxy that swallows everything and that disturbs our galaxy in a way that our existence is in jeopardy. Why am I having these deep, thought provoking, philosophical questions?I feel like I am living on borrowed time. In a way, we are all, but it feels like ""there will be this day when I learn I will be dying soon"" and that I am not eager to be there in that time period. I also feel like time flies and that everyday is a step closer to death, no matter how far away it is.Am I the only one feeling like this ? Is there a condition for what I am feeling ? My doctor will not get me evaluated by an external psychiatrist since he thinks he is able to diagnose me with his knowledge.Daily living is a challenge. Need - help !Thank you :) I feel like I am disconnected from reality or my body. Like if I live life in 3rd person.",0
"I have been feeling very depressed as of recently , and i literally just want to bash my head on a wall, I feel desperate, i need to get out of this place but there is nowhere to go, i want to rip my hair out and cease out of existence, its always like this for me, i have to live the same day over and over again and it gets fucking tiring , i have to start taking my meds again too and i really do not want to because, the feeling of feeling stable or better, is so strange and i hate it, its a fucking cycle i do not know what is wrong with me",0
"My life sucks or probably I am just mentally weak, i want to end it No details, i just want to kill myself, I am going out alone rn and I will probably throw myself in front of a car Idk what to say",1
"I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and ""put a shelter over ours heads"". For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them "" You should have never became parents"" or ""I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents""My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse",0
"As I write in r/depression. I state my life is fine. I know decent people and I have survived the indecent. I have learned a lot and my life is very decent for a 26 year old black man born in low class society. The worst thing in my life is probably masturbation and with that I am down to like 1 a days. I have goals and dreams. My family is decent enough. I have ladies in my life. I am actually Elevating, I can feel it. I have never gotten the girl I was after, everyone I have wanted I have failed at, so all my loves are circumstantial. I achieve in all but the loves I choose. In that I have still had women, I still achieve the casual sex, and I am about to be a millionaire and I doubt that will hurt my chances and I have even analyzed all my failure and it is made me better in my approach... so yea nothings wrong with me. Failure was never an option because I did not quit. I believe in God and I have beat the suicidal tendencies. there is nothing I dislike more in a game than a quitter. Why r/depression? I feel like life's been an interesting ordeal to say the least but fuck I feel like being a black man on this planet blows. If I had not joined the military in the past I would be fucked on a highway to nowhere right now and it is only getting worse on this planet. I was born 1995 before Gameboy got color and as we evolved through technology it feels to me that we have devolved as beings. Shit, I myself am piece of work and I work hard. It took a lot to be this decent, I literally dealt with years of darkness and still do, but I do not want to kill anyone, or destroy the world... I used to though. Honestly I think everyone is capable of anything if they put their mind to it but you must be willing to continue.Information is key, you have to be willing to grow. You must apply information to effort, no matter how fast or slow. The snail does not know where the fuck it is going and its not even capable of high speeds but that fuckers moving. Being poor, being stagnant, these are mindsets. Set your mind to something else. Knowing your situation is half the battle, the rest is faith baby. The odds of any of this existence bullshit do not exist, infinitesimal. Which means you are already beating the odds. Keep fucking fighting do not quit. This is for me as much as it is for whoever reads.I hope you equalstand... the better you are, the better I am, the better we can be to eachother, that is better people on the planet, making things a slightly better place. it is those who know the darkness that shine the brightest. Be brave. The time is always now. Do with that info what you will. I hope reddit does not remove this. I hope it touches someone. You are not alone in your suffering, there are others, there is hope, you are a good enough reason to continue. You are a great enough reason to be better. Blessings upon you from a stranger Hy(i)ding. There is nothing wrong with me",0
"There are times where I find myself thinking of suicidal thoughts but then after a couple minutes I am fine again, my question is how do I deal with the times where I find myself with these thoughts? I just need some advice",1
"My phone is not working, my charger stopped working, my plans fell through. I am having bad cramps. I am sad. Rough week- vacation onto bad start",1
"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",1
"I am not usually having fun, I hate people, nvr really click with anyone. I am not outgoing, I just hate my life and I have no idea how to change it.

All I want to do is sleep. I keep breaking down into tears several times a day. I feel like I am getting weaker and weaker. I left voicemails for a few therapists tonight, so I am hoping they will call me back and be able to help. But I am losing hope. I just fucking hate myself and wish I was never born I just want to die",1
Sorry the title pretty much says it all. I finally fell asleep at about 1am because I was absolutely exhausted but I had this really morbid nightmare and woke up at 2:50. It was graphic as hell and really disturbing -- I was too scared to fall asleep again so now I am shattered. The worst part was waking up in a cold sweat and desperately longing for my ex. I just wanted to cling to them and sob. I was terrified and they are the first place my mind went to. I do not think they will ever understand how much they meant to me and how willing I was to stick around when things got hard. I just wanted them. I think this might have pushed me a little further so. Idk if I am going to survive the week at this rate. I do not see a point in living. Really disturbing nightmare,1
What gets you motivated just do anything? I have been in a slump the last week or two. I can barely get of bed at this point. A couple days I have managed to get myself out of my apartment but generally I have not done much besides lay in bed or lay on my couch.My apartment needs to get cleaned. Its not terrible but definitely is not as clean as I usually keep it.I managed to get some laundry in but I just have no energy. How to get motivated,0
But I have to. I honestly just want to die I do not think I have the strength. I work an overnight job 4 fucking nights a week. Been doing it for almost a year now. Asked my job if I could switch shifts with my lazy coworker who only works 3 nights and ofc my coworker says they cannot do the 4 night schedule. I would quit but I do not have faith I can do anything else. So fucking tired of not being valued. I cannot take it anymore. I just cannot. cannot deal with life and my job right now.,0
"So I do not know where to start but. I am just fucking up so much. I know I have adhd but idk if that is what is causing this. My boyfriends parents sent me to go bring his lunch and I was alone in the car. I only drove to Lowes twice using her phone gps but I did not have it. I did not know weather to turn right or left and I cried all the way home. I just felt so done. Because I keep ducking up. My dad treated me like a child when I lived with him so this is different. How do they expect me to know where Lowes is after 3 times. I am afraid to take my adderall medication that I was prescribed just because idk. She gave me a Valium to calm me down and I am afraid to take that. I also do not even know if I still want to live with my bf cus I do not really like him but I am afraid to let the whole family down. Who the fuck do I blame for all this. Its to the point where I am really thinking about killing myself because I do not want to have to deal with this stress anymore. Its not that it seems peaceful to be dead but its nothingness (which is keeping me from doing it, the fear of death) I am afraid of everything my whole life is executive dysfunction and fear and I am ready for it to be over I am almost done with life",1
"I am 27 year old and recently got frustrated and depressed and lost interest on everything and lost my will to continue living when i realized that i have no power to chose or decide in my life.Like living alone, i am stuck with my parents and i cannot afford to live alone and do whatever i want.I am also working in a stressful job and never get paid on time which prevent me from financial independenceI am gay but unfortunately homosexuality is illegal in my countryMy only hobby is playing video games but recently these days i completely lost interest on them (when in fact i was super addicted during my entire life)I am searching for a new job but its so hard and life is hard and i am not even sure that a new job is what i needI have completely different state of mind than my family and never feel understood by them (nor by anyone) except people i met in europe during my education.I feel i have no future and someone is deciding on my behalf and i cannot do anything because that person who is deciding is making theright choice its like my subconscious/instinct is deciding and making the optimal decisions under the environment i am in, but these decisions are making me sad a lot because they are against my beliefs and what i want.This supposedly person is so powerful because he make the best practical decisions and have always tones of argument on their favor and i can only surrender myself and follow. Recently i am very sad and have no will to live (not to the point to suicide, i will never do that) and i am lost and people keep asking me if i am okay why i am sad, you look sad etcI feel like a minion in this world with zero impact and that my life is worthless and not human being but rather like an object because whatever happens it does not matter because everything in my life is already sh**t and i cannot change it because i already tried and keep trying and nothing good happens I have no control over my life",0

"so I am 25, clinically depressed, I take meds and I am broke going to start working at Amazon and still live with my mom. Went to a Bootcamp to become a data scientist. it is been a year since I have done anything related to the field probably sent like 20napplicaions in total. I feel like it is my depression that keeping me from enjoying things and makes me question do I even like this career? took me 5 years to get my associate's in electrical engineering. Then I switched my major again for the 4th time to data science and here I am questioning if I even want to do this. I am thinking maybe I just need to ignore my feelings of doubt, laziness, stress, anxiety, etc, and just fucking do it. I will be miserable in the short term but maybe in a year or 2 I will finally move out, be independent and maybe be happier?

Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I do not date anyone. Nothing really interests me so I do not have much to talk about. I suck at all conversations and once again I am so boring. When i was a kid I had a personality I was funny and goofy and happy. Now I am just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I cannot come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I want to be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I am not that. I know its depression that causes it. Depression makes me SO boring,0
"- I was dead every fucking second of the day- I was good enough for them and for my own standards- I was able to do things normally without overthinking everything every 2 minutes- I was able to enjoy things in the moment without having the deep set fear that this will go away soon and I will be miserable again- I could sleep without waking up from a shitty nightmare- I could forget my trauma- I was able to eat without thinking of my weight and calories- I could not feel like an imposter all the time.

"I have been depressed for years, meds do not seem to help. Already attempted a few times, seems like no one wants to let me go.... but the same people also never listen to me or to what I have to say. I feel it is so pointless being alive. I am constantly getting blamed for something I did not do, and no matter how I defend myself, people assume that I really did it. One time I called the cops because a customer was being very rude and aggressive. They never came and I called in the afternoon. The next day the same customer comes back to the store with 2 cops. The 2 cops take me to the back room and say ""we can either do this here or take you back to the police station and arrest you"". Like what do mean...... obviously I would rather do ""this"" here then go to a police station and get arrested. Anyways the cops pull out 4 pieces of paper with 8 size print, top to bottom with text and there like"" sign here, sign her and here"". Like I have no idea what I am signing and it would probably take be a while to read it all. After I signed the cops say that I am being charged for assault.... cops said the customer ""fears for his life"" and that I had hit him. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!??!?! Never touched the guy and not only that, I called in the day before and put in a report, and no one showed. Yet this guy gets 2 cops, says these lies and they just charge me for assault, did not talk to any of my coworkers, or check any of the 4 cameras in our store..... wow so this is how easy it is to be a cop? No detective work at all, no evidence that I touched the guy. Just some guy that said I had assaulted him. Fuck this guy and fuck these cops. End up spending $300 on a lawyer to write a letter to the cops that charged me, and not until 1.5 months later the cop finally calls me and drops the charges. Ngl I was super stressed for weeks. Idk this is just some of the things that keep on happening to me. does not matter where I go, it is like bad luck I guess. I rarely go out, really only to get groceries. I feel like everytime I go out, something bad happens to me, and the few people around me just like to ""push my buttons"" or poke at me? I do not really know how to describe it but, it just does not make me feel any better. Any turn I take happens to be the wrong one all the time. I dunno, it seems like stuff like this only happens to me. So I decided that there is a few more things that I want to do and then do the deed Death will stop it all?",1

I am going through a huge rough patch right now and I know it will get somewhat better eventually. But the parts of my life where I am somewhat happy are so few and far between.

"its been about a year and a half since i started feeling suicidal, i know my situation is not as bad as other peoples, i know my life is not but I am so fucking tired of waking up every morning i cannot do this shit anymore. I am in high school right now, well technically summer school since i basically refused to show up to about a year of school, and omg dude i cannot do this anymore. i just got out of being hospitalized, my third attempt and i cannot help but scream at everyone around me, why do i have to fucking be alive?? i saw another post about doing all the right things and still being depressed, and omg i relate so much, i go out with my friends, try to get a good nights sleep, I have tried to start running again, eating right, I have been to therapy, on my meds practiced my useless fuckibg coping skills and holy shit i feel exactly the same. my friends try to help but i just cannot explain it to them, they are so happy and they have never been through this and fuckkk its like there is nothing tying me here and I am so ready to let go i cannot believe I am still alive",1
I think I am asexual unfortunately. I just want to be like everyone else. I want normal feelings. I hate myself for this. I want to kms. I hate this. I want to be normal. Why am I like this,1
"I have different reasons to say that.I have had depression for years now, I am currently 21, going 22 in a few months, I am on medication and I talk to a psychologist.I have been hospitalized once and I was going crazy there, you had literally nothing to do there with all kinds of crazy people all around and I do not want to go back there.So my issues are that I pretty much have no irl friends, a partner is literally impossible for me to get one, I have social anxiety especially after some people beat me up for no reason at all (they live where I live), I dropped out of school different times and i have not finished it yet, I suck at everything that I do, even with the things that I like such as videogames (I have 5500+ hours on a game alone and I am so inconsistent) and speaking English which is not my native language , I have a job now but I suck at it even though I just have to clean some stuff which is supposed to be easy, boring but easy to do. I thought about ADD or brain fog but nobody seems to be able to help me, i apparently do not have any of those so I am just really stupid and I hate myself for that since it is not fixable. I tend to stutter a lot on the worst days and I just do not even want to speak sometimes and I cannot even talk to somebody sometimes because my brain will not work and I just do not know what to say some days.I just suck at life, nobody likes me, I am really ugly and this is just not worth living, I do not even want to kill myself, I wish i were not even born at all. I might have missed some things and typed so many typos but that is all I can do I am a failure of a human being",0

"Tw: Suicidal IdeationLast weekend I met up with my ex who I used to (and still do) love very much. It was great for a day and a half...Then my anxiety started kicking in. I started over analyzing everything he did during the time we spent together. I started to ruminate. And now it feels like all of the progress I have made has gone down the drain. I was not exactly going upwards in the week proceeding the meetup either, but it was not this bad. I am currently on anti-depressants, but I feel like they are not helping right now. I had two panic attacks yesterday, over really stupid stuff that should not matter in the long run since what I was considering were hypotheticals anyway. I also got drunk for the first time tonight, and that felt good. Had some sloppy sex with an FWB, and it was good. And now I feel bad again. Empty. On the way over to his place, I started thinking about suicide again. Like what if I decided to take my antidepressants before I was fully sober again, and kill myself? What if I just stopped caring and drove my car into a pole at 50+ mph?Like, I cannot handle this. I have been in love with him for more than a year after our breakup. These feelings refuse to leave, no matter what I do. I have done talk therapy, I have gotten a new job, I have tried going to college, studying, working myself into the ground, getting enough sleep and exercise, eating healthy. All of it for a month or so at a time, and I just do not feel good. I have also tried the quick fixes, like pot, alcohol, and sex. Oh, and the anti-depressants.These things do help, do not get me wrong, but especially recently I have been feeling like utter crap. And these feelings because guilt, and because me to want to reach out to him, and I know my ex would not push me away, but I do not want to rely on him too much. And talking about these things somehow make it worse... And I feel entirely at a loss for how to express my emotions without annoying, burdening, or causing other people pain. Being in love is getting tiresome. Trying to move on is getting tiresome. Life is getting tiresome. And to be clear... I do not blame my ex for any of this. I reached out to him. It was my fault for seeing him before I was ready. it is my problem, and I need to figure out how to fix it. I am So Confused",0

"I have simply failed at everything I have ever attempted. Maybe I had some success early, never sustained. It feels like every move I make is wrong and I look at my friends or family, and every move they make is the right one. I get a real panic when thinking about it and realize I do not want to. I do not want to think about what a loser I am or how every decision backfires. Tried suicide once years ago, but did not take enough pills. I think its time to try again. I am just so tired of my life. Even with so much good in it, the temporary pain to those around me will subside and at least I can turn my brain off permanently. Ever realize you have just failed?",1
"I just really want to get this out, and maybe please hopefully someone has some words that might be able to help at all. I am really really sorry about it being so long, I just need to get it outIm a 26 year old Indian man grown up in quite a traditional household in the UK, which means mental health is always a taboo subject, and as such I have never brought up any issues I have had with my parents. I think on some level they might know I have experienced issues in some capacity, given I have done a lot of reading on the subject, and done charity work for mental health charities etc. but a part of me wonders if their upbringing makes it obvious to believe that its a true problem that is not sorted with a hugSo I went to a good school, excellent university, had great grades, show great social skills as a front whenever I need to, had a good job, then took a two years out and moved to Japan, and now moved back a month ago living with my parents for the first time in 8 years.Something is wrong, I just feel so mentally fragile all the time. Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 1-2 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory, I grew up with no friends, a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM (Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years). Which I always saw as a positive, because whatever it was, it was in the past, and I am beyond that. From 18-20 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father, the only person I had felt close to until that time (excluding my brother), and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time, but then when I moved to America, this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year, pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex, these 3-4 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident, over all the trust issues (or so I thought), regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job, a great house, good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan, and again, the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting, new city, new culture, incredible new career, learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time, which happened to be during covid quarantine, and as such went from 0-100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say, connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time, finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me, so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people, but somehow it worked, I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong, it was very high-functioning, and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of ""strong mind""However again through a few of half-truths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months, sort of put a damper on it, and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round, although not condoning it, I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies, and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together, as there was no malicious intent. Long story short, the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again, mainly trust, and whenever I get stuck thinking about it, it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because, the more I think about it, rather than from the actual issues from the relationship, I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to, I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship, and I struggle trust again, and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan, because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation, yoga, and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck, I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind, to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head, and I find myself going over the same thing, and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief, and just continually ruin my day-to-day life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped, yoga, meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long, the relationship lack of trust, the lack of job, the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything, and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift, but the prospect of anything new / surprise / out of the ordinary just breaks me, and I had to walk away saying I did not want it, half angry, while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do, nothing I do feels like it helps, and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day, while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life, but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help, something to do, something to focus on, anyone who is been through something similar, or even someone to talk to, I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life",0

"I have daydreamed about suicide every day since I was 12. I started getting depressed at way younger than that, but I would say the fantasies started around middle school. Back when I was in school I would zone out in class and make all Fs because I was constantly daydreaming. It went all through middle and high school and now that I am an adult with a job I do it at work to. Imagining the goriest death for myself. All throughout my youth I would use chatrooms and forums dedicated to people planning to commit suicide. I really thought I would not make it to 16, but here I am at 21. Ending my own life is the only real dream or goal I have ever consistently had. What am I waiting on? How old am I supposed to be when I do it? I just hope its not much longer What am I waiting for?",1

"I lost a lot of things due to my mental illnesses. But this is probably the best thing that I have lost. I got a 10 month old puppy, a gorgeous labrador pitbull mix. We had her for around a month. She made me smile and giggle all the time. She felt like the only friend I had close to me. Someone that I could hug and cuddle with. I even tried to take of her leash at the dog park the 2nd day we got her and she kept running back to me, looking for me always. But she was a puppy, and a big one, around 25 kgs. So she made a lot of damages, chewed a lot of shoes and it took her a while to learn to pee outside. Due to low energy and loss of appetite I struggled to take her for walks except for maybe once a day and just let her outside in the yard when she needed to go.. I barely take care of myself so taking care of all the mess she kept making was not something I could do. My family got frustrated with the situation and decided to gove her away. They said I did not try hard enough. Its all my fault that she left. I hate myself. I miss her so much. But hey at least I can cry, have not been able to for a while. I do not have anyone else to be here for me. I just need a hug. Stupid rant from a stupid person over. I lost probably the greatest dog because of my incapability",0

This is a constant thing that happens. Every single time I feel like I am pulling myself out of the hole someone or something comes along and put me back in the hole deeper than what I was before. Its easy to say well do not let it get to you. Honestly I have heard that so many times the next person that says that can fuck off because no matter what happens it is going to get to me. It does not matter if its now or next week I will think about it. A glimmer of hope then shot down,0

I wish I was as smart and mature as people think I am.

I do not have the desire to play videogames or watch youtube videos anymore, I just want to be dead.Even writing this note is too much energy for me, living like this is painful, and it has too end.do not tell me it will get better, I call out your bluff, you know it is not true right? Life only gets worse the more Iive, and if this does not apply to you, the keep quiet and do not lie to me.I do not want to live for others, I want to live for myself, and right now, I do not want to live.I was simply born wrong, I should not have lived this long, I do not deserve to live, I am worthless, and I wish I could have been born as a better person, just like the normal people that just get to enjoy their lives without much struggle.I regret not ending it sooner, I wasted a lot of resources that other people could have used.

The part I did not share is that I actually have thoughts of ending my life daily. I would not act on it as I know it would traumatise my nephew and he calls me his best friend. Another reason is because I am scared of not being successful and ending up trapped in my body. My mind working but I am unable to communicate my wishes so I have somebody else making decisions that they believe Id want but in reality is what they would want me to want.

"hi everyone, I am sorry to put this much baggage on your shoulders but I have nowhere else to go and could use a little bit of empty as I cannot bear this anymore.I am almost 30 years old, I have been struggling with depression for the last 16 years, always on and off, some days are great some others are unbearable pain and suffering, it is such a horrible roller coaster of emotions that I cannot handle anymore.these last 6 years were great, I only felt suicidal a couple of times which was a breathe of fresh air, I spent those 6 years with my beautiful girlfriend, I thought to myself, this is it, I am here to stay, this is my calling, my reason to be here, to love this woman to the very end, I pictured us together, Grey hair and wrinkles, sat next to each other just watching the sun set, happy...i poured my heart and soul on this relationship, I changed jobs multiple times every time taking a step forward in my career, I started working out, even when there was a discussion the last thing I would say at night was ""I love you"" I avoided anything that would make her uncomfortable, never gave her a reason to be jealous, we had our differences and would get into trouble for that but I would encourage open communication, sometimes it worked...yet I am still back here in this sub, after 6 years she put an end to the relationship, she was not feeling loved anymore, what did I did wrong, in trying to understand, i found out she started to talk to a guy in another country, she blocked me from social media so I could not see what she posts, we still talk we are still intimate but there is this hollowness growing inside me, she has made it clear, we are not meant to be together, I feel used, I feel robbed, I feel alone, everyday the pain just grows and grows, it is impossible to handle, i feel so broken again, it is so painful to just breath, this pressure in my chest, the hollow breaths, the frustration, the anxiety, hell I am even typing this during a meeting, I am not functional anymore, I do not want to grow older anymore, I am scared I might lose my job, I do not have anyone to listen to me, I realize I was just trying to find temporary solutions to a permanent problem, I do not fit in this world and I cannot force myself to try to fit anymore, last week I tried therapy but it is too late for me, the trauma of this pain will haunt me forever. everyone night before I go to sleep I spend at least 3 hours crying my eyes out, I try to choke myself with a belt but the fear stops me every time, it is been 3 weeks like this, I wish I could just stop breathing, but I feel guilty, I feel guilty just for being alive and I feel guit, I do not want to leave my mother alone, I would rather die by an illness of accident so she could cash out my life insurance but I am too healthy to die like that, why do I feel like this? she was never a good parent, I mean she tried I guess, I do not know, it just pains me to see my pictures as a child and see what I have become, no one deserve to live like this yet here I am, I hope this will be my last day, I have bought a helium tank and wish I have the will to carry on with this, if the fear takes over again, I guess I will see you around, but it do not get to read you again I wish you all find the peace you are looking forthank you for your time cannot handle this anymore",1
"I am just starting to really try and take care of myself better and I had a question, smothered are.times when I get really down for lack of a better term and feel like nothing will ever get better but then in like 5 or 10 minutes ill be fine, so my question is if this is some kind of of depressive disorder or something and what are some ways to deal with it.

"Every time I think about killing myself, or imagining a world where I kill myself, I am genuinely happyI really do not want to be like that, but I do not want to and I will not do anything to improve it, because that is the way I amI've never had complex problems in my life, she is even good, so why am I like that? isolated, suicidal, I cannot carry on a conversation and I am still happy with that kind of thinkingMaybe I do not want to kill myself, but rather sleep forever and stay in this world invented by me and my paranoiaAnd something I wanted to hate but really cannot: the thought of killing myself the night before my birthday. I wanted to see how it would really feel if I died, maybe it is because I do not see so much value in my life, so I wanted someone to give itI honestly do not even know why I am writing this, I am pretty skeptical and I know it will not change or help anything, I kind of just want to go screaming that I am a bastard who wastes a good life like that Why am i genuinely happy when i think/plan to kill myself? even never tried",0
"Been having suicidal thounghts since I was 10, I am 24. Was able to use work to distract me from thoughts but last December I had a work place injury that caused me to have seizures and chronic migraines. Had to move back in with my dad and nephew because I coupdnt drive to get groceries or make appointments. For 6 months workers comp kept postponing a neurological visit while I watched the medical bill pile climb. Finally saw a Dr who was 2 hrs 30min away and after 2 visits lasting 15 min each, he said it was stress related. Workers comp dropped me like a sack of potatoes and said good luck. 1 month later and still having episodes without any sign of a trigger. Memory is getting worse, was not able to remember nephews name and after dad got back from a week long trip I did not recognize his face. Tried getting CBT but cannot afford it. Going to online school to keep mind occupied but will fall asleep for 24-36 hrs after a 6hr course day. Tried using free therapy but cops showed up to house to take me to ER after telling Dr over phone that idealizition was getting to point I was having visions of doing it and waking up confused when I was still at my computer desk. Overheard nephew telling people all I do is sleep and that he does not like that I lived with him. Dad stopped having genuine conversations with me after talking to the cops. Last thing he said was I should not put him through lossing a son. Now when I talk to him it seems like he is annoyed or wants me to figure out how to be happy. Other family members or friends have told me to get over it after telling them what the Dr told me. I have tried telling myself that I am having the seizures on purpose for attention and that I have tricked myself into believing they are real. When I end up sleeping for entire day or two, I have been telling myself its because I am a leech wanting people to feel bad for me. I want to go back to work but I am super nervous about trying to explain that I have stress induced seizures that because me to have partial awareness and that sometimes my feet and, hands turn blue for no reason. I also fear trying to explain why I was receiving workers comp for 6 months.I want to have a good relation with my nephew but all he does is lie to get outta chores\work so he can watch reaction videos. When I tried playing a board game with him, he said he did not like playing games were he can lose. He told me he liked pc stuff so I tried showing him IT stuff which he said he only likes YouTube. I tried watching youtube videos with him but it was all grown men screeching and overacting to minecraft.I am super tired all the time to the point I cannot play video games without falling asleep. I try excersising but I end up feeling drunk asf and unable to eat without pain. I had to reduce the amount pot I smoke (not a stoner) because I kept going into hr long convulsions. I wish I had the courage to grab my shotgun and create a cavity where my heart is. I keep hoping that during an episode I choke on my tongue or my heart rips itself apart. So Tired",1
"I want to be prescribed a med that will take the edge off and make me less nervous and anxious, and will also take depression away. Simultaneously, I also want to take something that will make it harder to laugh. One thing I always do frequently is laugh when I am bored or want to feel happy. But since I live up under my parents, one of my parents are starting to feel like my laughter is annoying. It is not uncontrollable laughter, but it is noticed by one of them and they feel my wanting to laugh is annoying. I want to tell the doctor that I laugh without him thinking I am manic.. I do not want him to send me to some other thing I have to pay for because he thinks it is manic laughter. But I do want to be able to convince him that I need an anti depressent/anti anxiety med that will make laughing something that is harder to do. What should I tell the doctor?",0
When to stop crying? I do not think I care anymore. I feel nauseous and headache and a little twinge of chest pain. Is that a grief problem? I just do not want to get sick. I know people going to treat me differently. I cannot stop crying. I sorry I do not mean to spam. I just cannot stop thinking about my dad. I do not know what to do we cannot afford to burry him. I put up a fundraiser without talking to my sister and other family because I do not want him to be cremated. I am a little panicking right now because I do not know if everyone know he gone or not and that is a horrible way to find put a love has pass on. I am not really thinking right now. My head hurts.

"I do not feel the same way about the things I used to feel passionate about...Singing...performance arts....drawing...writing....Feeling that my talents are worthless and have not gotten me anywhere in life. Feeling hopeless and lost. Have you felt this way now? In the past?it is truly heartbreaking to feel you lost a part of your soul. Feeling partially dead inside. Life has so much to offer and is so incredible, but the mind disrupts the perspective and rots the positivity. I have lived with depression almost my entire life. Even early signs of it in 2nd grade. I do not wish this on anyone and I never want anyone to feel as I do, but sometimes you can take comfort in knowing people understand and empathize how this suffering feels I lost my passion",0

"I really, and I mean really hate people. I hate that I cannot avoid social connections. I hate that literally everything I do or everywhere I go, I have to be around people. 25 years of socialising, and it just gets worse and worse everyday. I fucking hate my family, I fucking hate everyone. I hate the sellers I have to contact with when I need something from the grocery store. I hate the clerks I have to talk to. I hate other humans that walk on the streets or sitting in other cars. I hate waiters and waitresses that fake sympathy and kindness just for a little a tip. (Like jeez, maybe I consider tipping if you just shut the fuck up.) I hate the courier that delivers something I ordered on a webshop. I hate that I have to cross-check with my boss and coworkers. I am really weird and socially awkward (I might have autism) and I have speech errors. I can tell how they judge and hate me. Why I just cannot fucking be alone? How the fuck can I totally isolate myself? My awereness for surrounding/situational awereness is totally shattered, I am living in my own head and thoughts and I cannot always tell if I am in a lucid dream or what. So my mind is isolated totally, but now I want to physically isolate myself. How can I isolate myself from literally everyone?",1
"I have been having anxiety and depression since ~5 years. I somehow managed to live with it. Last year, with covid, my depression got really worse. And this year, since a few months, its even worse. I have no friends, like, absolutely no friends. No one ever send me messages to have news from me, no one gives a shit about me. I could be dead, they would not notice. I have thought about talking about it to my family but it would just worry them, and I do not want them to feel bad because of me. I also do not want them to think I am crazy, I am not, I am just desperately alone. I do not think I will ever be capable to commit suicide, but lately I have been thinking about how would people react if I was dead. Would they suddenly care about me ? For the first time in my life I am having suicidal thoughts",0

"My big bro is a role model to me, he is got a house, a girlfriend, a job and he is well paid, he is got a strong personality and each member of our family admires him. he is also very attached to my two sisters (one older one younger) he talks to them a lot. But for me, its another story, I am the weirdest of the sisters (weird in a bad way) and I just feel like he hates me, our conversations are so blank, our message text can be resumed as ""do not forget your meds"" ""yes"" ""I will come over at xxpm"" ""okay!"" Everytime he talks about our sisters its always about the happy things that happened to them, when its about me, its often about the weird shit I did as a kid. Once he said ""you were a piece of shit when you were a kid"". We are currently at our grandma's house for holidays, he came over to say hi and when he left, he said goodbye to my little sister and ignored me, turned his back and went to his car.I just do not know what to do. Is it depression that make me think that way? Maybe its my actions as a child that reflect today, I am really confused and completely lost. I think my big brother hates me",0

Masturbating when depressed is bad because it makes you sadder after you cum. It feels good for a few seconds but after your orgasm you feel regret and more depressed than before.This is my opinion from my experience . Masturbation worsens depression,0
I guess I have always felt like this. Ever since I can remember I get random outbursts of wanting/ having to get out of the place I am in. I have moved so many times I have lost count yet no place ever feels like home. The few people who have felt like that I drive away with my sadness. And the ones who stick around only seem to hurt me. I turned 27 this year and I feel more lost than I ever have. I keep quitting jobs and isolating myself/ pushing people away seem to be the only hobbies I am consistent with. Would therapy help at this point? I have tried that so many times. Antidepressants make me more depressed and keeping sober is the only thing keeping me sane at this point bc self medicating turns into escapism real quick for me. I have reached out to close friends and family as well but all I get is the pep talk. Only temporary it will get better just a phase that happens to everyone every once in a whileThe thing is I know I am not special. I know there is so many people out there who have it worse. Just thinking about it sends me through a guilty black hole of self pity and contempt for my lack of control over my own emotions. When will I stop feeling this emptiness? Does it ever really get better? I just feel a perpetual state of time passing by me while I watch myself in third person and feeling like a spectator of my own life. I feel out of place everywhere I go,0

"When I mentioned to my friend that I just wished I was pair of floating eyeballs in this world with no body, just observing everything, she said You already told me that once before. The feeling of perceived is an especially horrifying thought for me for some reason, even more so now that I am 24. I do not know what brought over this sudden phobia but many times I caught myself thinking I wish I could disappear forever. Maybe its the idea of having to exist more than a viewer is what is upsetting to me. Maybe I do not want to participate in Life anymore. Do all the things I have to do when I am supposed to. I thought about running away. But what am I running away from? To where? Should I do it now? What about my job? Does anything even matter?I started taking antidepressants yesterday and everything stated above may be a result of that but maybe not. I just wish I could understand what I am feeling honestly. But I really do not. I am feeling numb about people that I care about. I have no interest in living any longer. I really do not care for the future. I am showing no interest in dating, having and raising a family, hobbies, just enjoying my life in general. My life is mostly empty but I am not trying to fill it, it seems. there is nothing I want to fantasize about. This is something I would have to live with. I feel like no matter what happens, I will be sad for the rest of my life. And nothing will change that. I wish I could put more effort into me but its hard to find a reason to. I am aware its starting to affect my relationships with friends and family but my apathy is greater. I want to be unapologetically me. Wear what I want, do what I want without any fear. And I find myself wishing that was me when I see others living out their best lives.

Humans have obviously already won that battle. Its all just a sick competition between life forms trying to kill, steal, dominate, take advantage of one another and it cannot change.

"7.7.21Should I kill myself?A long journal entry that mulls over the idea of suicide, why I was born, why I continue to live when its so easy to die, and why I am holding on even though most days I think about killing myself at minimum 4-8 times.I am tired of being around everyone that I loveI no longer find joy in the things I once cared for, and in general I am becoming a very bitter, mean person to be around.I was not always like this though, once upon a time I was just a small child who did not choose to be born, and I was busy dealing with an insane woman who would punch me in the head if the sky was the wrong shade of blueShe did not think she was doing anything wrong, because kids in other countries had so much less than we didShe never took the time to teach us about these things, because she was too busy yelling and avoiding being with us as much as humanly possibleBut I digressRecently, I have been lucky enough to find someone who loves me, and somehow I feel like I am fucking that up all the time tooHe does not know how sad I am on the inside, because I do not trust him enough to tell himThats not on him, I just have never told anyone about the monster that lives in my heartIts always there, just slightly off in the distance waiting for me to come and fall into its dark and comforting embrace and phwoo, its getting really hard not to wander over there and just fall off that cliffI tell you what boy, there is absolutely nothing like the darknessI have been there before and it is comforting, let me tell you whatBeing alive is hard, being in a relationship is hard, dealing with the world and hoping for people to get better is hardBut the darkness? Holy shit no one talks to me in the darkness.No on interrupts me in the darkness, no one tells me my ideas are wrong or that the things I talk about will never workNo one can hurt you in the darkness, no one except yourselfDamn what a choice.What a fucking choice.I am just sitting around being in pain all the time, and what your supposed to do is go to therapy But I have been to therapy, I have seen those peopleI was little, sitting in offices talking about how I was being abused and no one helped me then, so how am I supposed to trust these people to help me now?I do not fucking trust anybody, no one.Not a doctor, not an expert in a field, not the people close to meYou cannot trust people because people are fucking insanos.My mother threw me down a cement staircase because she was mad that I ran away from home because I was afraid of her doing something craxy like oh, I do not know, throwing me down a cement staircaseMy dad fucking walked out, told me he was going to be with his new family because being with me was too difficult, and then showed up almost 8 years later to let me know I was a failure and I was not trying hard enoughBecause I was lying about my grades, because all the people in my house were abusive and terrible people. But he dint know that, because he had, again, been gone for about 8 years.So I digress, but if these two DNA donors cannot be trusted, how the fuck am I supposed to trust anyone elseThe only person I ever trusted, my grandma, is long since dead.And honestly, I have a harder time every day keeping myself alive instead of killing myself and going to hang out with herLike, people spend their whole lives thinking they will go to paradise, they will go to heaven. They put all their faith in people that live in the fucking sky.I met my grandma bitch, I know she was real.I remember her rubbing my back with an egg to take all the pain away, and here my dumbass is 10 fucking years later, with 10 years of pain built up in my back and my soul and my heart because I do not have anyone to rub an egg on me anymore to make me feel betterSo what the fuck manHow do I keep goingHow am I supposed to keep walking this walk when all the time I look outside and I just want to go nope and throw myself off the roofLike I am supposed to be worried about people missing me I guarantee you everyone will be just fucking fine if I am goneLike, everyone close to me at this point has only known me for 3-5 years, definatly not long enough to give more than 2 shits about 2 months after I am deadSo yeah. I am having a reeeeeeeeeeeeeeallly hard time finding reasons to stay aliveLike, for what?So I can watch everyone I love succumb to the disastrous effects of climate change? So I can die in a climate disaster?So I can die of some insano disease that I do not have any money for?Nah man fuck thatSuicide is the one time you can go hey, fuck you! and just fuck offMan, being alive is so painful. Like all day I am just sad and worried and I am supposed to just act like everything is fucking ok, and its not fucking ok and I am tired of acting like its all fucking okThe world is literally on fire, people are murdering children everywhere, and I am stuck in butt fuck suburbia being sad all day long, trying to finish my English homework which takes way more effort than it should at this point in my lifeSo I do not know, what the fuck man I cannot even tell anyone that I feel sad or else everyone is going to start worrying and freaking out and its like damn can I feel my fucking feelings? Can I talk about the world being a piece of shit and just one person go yeah you are right now what can we do? and I do not feel so fucking crazy all the timeLike how do some people have so many friends and I cannot get anyone to be my friend and talk with me and agree with me on any of this shitI feel like I am going insane, like its just me watching the world slowly implode while people are just going into work like everythings fine and we should not be paying attention to thingsI just feel so low, so pessimistic, so sad and so heartbrokenBut people say do not lose hope, and I got to say to those people you can go fuck yourselvesLike you keep being hopefull in this shitty ass world, I am done boyIm feeling like the darkness is just where I belongI do not have any kids, any family, any anything that is enough to make the darkness go awayIts just aways been there, waiting for me to just lay in it and go to sleepAnd with the way the world is right now, I do not see a reason why I should not do just that at this pointI do not want to live anymore.I am just so exhausted with being alive, with being a person, with being around other peopleI just want to scream that everything is no ok but no one listens to meI always feel so ignored, like my ideas are so uncomfortable and no one wants to deal with itAnd it makes me furious, because the truth isint an easy thing to deal with but it needs to be doneAnd no one wants to do it, so why should I stay here?Why should not I risk it all, on the off chance that I die and my grandma is there waiting for me with that egg?Pwhoooooooooooooooooooo I am having a rough one todayI just want my grandmaI do not care about anything else anymoreIm just a tired little girl who would like some affection from her grandmother, the only person who made her feel safe, and loved, and cherished, in a way that I have never felt since her deathI wish there was still someone around who loved me for me, who listened to me, but that is gone nowNow I am stuck here, on this dumbass planet with these insano people, and I am just supposed to do this and contribut to this terrible broken piece of shit ass system for the rest of howeverFuck that man I am out 7.7.21",1
"I met someone on Hinge about eight months ago and we got along instantly which is extremely rare for me. We could not meet in person at the time due to lockdown restrictions. It started like any online dating relationship starts, with flirting and asking questions and getting to know one another. All of a sudden he stopped showing interest. That really affected my already low self-esteem and I tried my best to talk to him and figure out why he lost interest. I came across as cold and scary, he became very defensive, it got quite bad and I had quite a severe panic attack that took five propanolol to sort out. I blamed myself and he reluctantly came back, he would be even colder and more distant now. No more good mornings or how are yous, no flirting, no questions, nothing. Just very short superficial talks about current events or interests. I tried to ask him in a more direct way why he was behaving like that and it resulted in him ignoring me. I gave up and deleted him off all social media (except the one we used for messaging) and moved on with my life. Two months later he messages me saying how much he misses me and wants to rectify things. Nobody has ever come back for me, it meant a lot. We start talking again, nothing gets rectified he just repeats himself whilst ignoring and not apologizing for how he behaved. But I am just happy he is back so I let it be. We finally meet and it goes somewhat well, he does not flirt but he seems interested again. Fast forward to our 5th date and we sleep together. Afterwards he just goes back to being distant despite always being online. It makes me extremely overwhelmed and I go talk to him. I am ignored until he replies about how he cannot take it anymore and how it is not his fault work was busy. I mentioned how affection or at least signs of interest are and he was having none of it. Ultimately I blamed myself and explained my current family situation as it also affects me to maybe make him understand that I just really needed some support and he ignored me for days. I would avoid messaging him but I would always see him online. I asked him for closure as I did not know what do he replied instantly, said it was a shame as we were so compatible and that if I wanted we could still be friends. When I replied that if we both tried it could work, he ignored me again. The day after I went for a day out on the beach and saw a little stall that does clam chowder which I have never tried before meeting him and it is one of his fav foods, when I got home I messaged him saying that I wanted to take him there to show him something even if just as friends. He ignored me again. The day afterwards (which was yesterday) I had a job interview. I have been trying really hard these past years to finally have my own life. I have been through therapy, medication and regularly study and follow well-being advice. Currently, I live with my mom - who has her own set of mental health problems lately she is been well but at times she becomes awful towards me. Especially if I show emotions, the worst ones are if I cry or seem angry (even if I am not, if she thinks I am then that is an invitation to start a fight) - and my cat - who is dying of lymphoma. I am an immigrant so I do not have many friends here. Most of my friends are from work but lately everybody is too busy for me. So this job interview meant a lot. If I get this, I may very well be able to afford to live in my own place. In the hype of the interview, I made a decision to move on and have a fresh start. New job, then new house, new life. And I was tired of feeling so overwhelmed and weighed down by everything and now being given false hope. So I messaged a final time, stating this could have all been sorted within a day. How it is impossible to form any relationship with someone who simply is not there. I then deleted him off the messaging app we use and his number. He has not attempted to communicate but it is not as if I am expecting it. I do not think I am wrong. I think that if he wanted to this could work. What affects me is why is it that nobody ever wants to at least try to make it work? I am willing to compromise, I have always hyped him up and showed him that he matter to me. Every morning I would wish him a good morning despite knowing I would not receive one back, the same would happen at night. So what is it about me that so damn disgusting that does not even deserve a good morning? I am afraid to cry under my own roof. I have absolutely nobody in this world and the only creature on this planet that somehow loves me is going to die soon. I cannot trust anyone because of the amount of times I have been bullied, rejected, belittled, used, harmed. I have attempted suicide twice before so I know this third time I would not fail, plus three times the charm. The only thing keeping me here is waiting to hear back from the interview and how bitterly disappointing it is that now, after my entire life spent trying to overcome trauma and abuse, when I am finally getting where I want, someone appears and completely kills any crumb of love I had for myself just by not bothering to be there. After a half-ghosted ""relationship"" ended I have been thinking about suicide for the past days",1
"I do not know. Comparing to others, I cannot complain much about my life. I have a good family, no divorce or illness in any kind. I have a boyfriend who, in a way, loves me very much. I still have a stable income during this pandemic, not much, but stable. To anyone else around me, after hearing that part they will all be like: ""Great, so what is the problem?"" And that is it. I do not know. I do not know what is wrong. But I do not want to live anymore. I do not know when I got this thought, but it lingers in my mind like a parasite. I feel like I am trapped in this body. And I do not have the strength to keep going, or the willing to keep going. I just want to stop. I just want everything to stop. I want my heart to stop pounding, my brain to stop thinking, my body to stop moving. Everyday I wake up, I feel like someone else, pretending to live my life, pretending to be okay to everyone else because really, my life seems fine to other. Even great to some others (what they said).I want to get better. I really do. But I just do not know what is wrong.

"So I have been building up depressed feelings over the past year. By now I am at the point where I just do not see the point in life on this earth anymore. I do not like myself, my social life is a flop, I have too much anxiety to study and I do not feel like I have a future (apart from how fucked up this world is in general). I sometimes to about this with my partner and I express not wanting to wake up or just die and I will ask the question ""Why would I keep going?"". His answer then is ""Well because existing is better than not existing"". But I am wondering... Is that even true? Is it really better to exist for a full life, where at the end of the balance you felt like shit 80-90% of the time? is not it then better to not exist at all?I was wondering what you guys think about this from a philosophical point of view? Is existing better than not existing?",0
"I need (F 30) some advice on how I can reach out to my friends after being distant for a few months. let us call them friend A and B. In December 2020 I started getting really depressed due to a highly stressful job, the fact that for the first time ever Id be spending Christmas alone (covid lockdowns, family far away) and finding out that a close family member has cancer. For New Years I went to friend As house and she asked me about my relative and the cancer treatment, but I kept getting interrupted while other people in the background were making jokes and my friend was not really listening. She was like, Oh sorry you were saying, go onI was feeling highly sensitive and about to cry but she was not listening to what I had to say. I felt shut down but I was not going to let this be a reason for getting mad at her. Now friend B, I have known most of my life, almost 20 years. We wished each other happy New Years and I asked her when she is free to FaceTime. Again, I was a wreck, just spent Christmas alone, had intrusive thoughts about my relative. I really needed to talk to her. I get that Christmas time is busy but she got back to me around Jan 13 we can FaceTime tomorrowThat was 2 weeks later and in those 2 weeks my mental health declined even more. At this point, I did not even feel like texting her back right away. I texted her a few days later and admitted that I am in a bad headspace and Ill FaceTime her in a few days. But I did not. My mental health kept getting worse, I was not taking care of myself, skipped showers, I was binging on unhealthy foods, not exercising, had insomnia, headaches, neglected to take care of things around the house. And I could not stop crying. Id cry soon after waking up, while driving to work, Id cry on my lunch breaks, and when I got home. I started developing intrusive thoughts, thinking what is the point of it all, how I hate the way my life turned out, etc.Things got REALLY bad. Friend A and B texted me on my birthday (end of Feb) and it took me days to even read the messages, and text back. Everything, even the smallest tasks took so much effort. Literally on my birthday, I kept getting messages from people and I wanted to throw my phone out the window. It was not a happy birthday. I was at work and on my lunch break, went for a drive to get a coffee and again started bawling my eyes out. I thanked them for the wishes and did not say anything else. Now fast forward to mid March, its friend Bs birthday. I wished her a happy birthday but she never texted back.Which I understand. My lack of communication could have been taken the wrong way as I never explained to them what I was truly going through. I think about my two friends all the time, and I wish I had not fucked up our friendships. I want to reach out and apologize but I do not even know where to start. Were now in JulyI was basically a ghost for 6 months. I never suffered from such deep depression in my whole life, it was so bad that even the smallest tasks took a lot of effort. I become so isolated, desperately tried to work on myself. But it takes time. You cannot get better over night. Only now i am starting to feel like myself again, not 100% back to normal yet but getting there. How can I fix friendships after isolating myself due to depression?",0

"Every day I find myself experiencing a sense of insufferable emotional anguish. Even though I give my best effort every day and am much farther in life than I used to be, I am always wishing that there was something more that I could do to make my life seem worth living. Yet, I never know what that ""something"" is. It is almost like I am trapped in every area of my life (my body, my emotions, my family, my relationships, my finances etc.) with no escape. I often dream of running far away with someone random that would change my life forever. I know this is incredibly unrealistic and from what I am learning, it is beneficial to practice mindfulness and find enjoyment in the ordinary. I have tried creating a gratitude's list, in addition to approaching everyday events at face value, but it all feels like it is in vain. The only time I am comfortable with the mundane is when I am incredibly depressed and find solace in the thought of death. Does anyone else feel this way? Are there any strategies that you guys have found to help escape feeling trapped in your life? How do you deal with wanting more from life?",0
"it is one of those nights.i lack the vocabulary, hell, perhaps there are not enough words in the english language or any language to convey the hole that loneliness burns through one's chest cavity. it is acidic, it feels as if loneliness is gnawing through my ribcage and attacking the chambers of my heart piece by piece,. it is methodical, it is diabolical, it feels like the epitome of self-destruction.it is embarrassing, it is devastating, it feels like i am living someone else's life that was not meant to be my own. i thought that by this time in my life (24f), i would have a group of friends, a significant other, things to look forward to and a stable career with opportunities for growth. i do not know where i went wrong. i do not know what happened or how i got here, friendless and loveless at an age where i should have my life together by now, where i should at least have some semblance of an idea of where i am heading.the feeling of disappointment is unbearable. i feel like i let my parents down, i feel like i let myself down, i feel like i do not deserve anything. most days i feel as if it would be better if i just faded away in my sleep, then no one would have to worry about me and what will become of me. the only reason i am still here is because i do not wish to put my parents through the pain of taking away the only life they created, to throw away all their dreams and ambitions. the problem is i cannot live up to any of them. i cannot live up to the expectations, i cannot live with the thought of not making them proud, i cannot live with myself. it is agony, this loneliness. it is agony to watch others living their best lives, sharing cute/intimate moments with their partners, living life as it is meant to be lived. i feel absolutely disgusting for feeling this touch-starved, for feeling this devoid of affection, of romance, of physical touch. i would give my last breath to just be held and assured that everything will be okay, that i am not a disgusting worthless waste of space, that i am desired and wanted. that there is a point to all of this. it hurts. it hurts to breathe, it hurts to live. i wish i could give my life to someone who has something to live for, who has the courage and motivation and willpower to make something of themselves. i feel my heart physically disintegrating in my chest.",0

"So, a bit about me: I am a 21 year old guy. Grew up in a family that strongly believes in academics to be the most important thing in life. Consequently, I had no lack of support from them for my studies, rather, saying ""I want to study"" was a common excuse for me to not do my chores. While I say excuse, I loved to study. We did not have internet or television, so most of what I read was textbooks provided by our school, and sometimes novels I took out of the school library. My school grades were top notch. The school itself was highly competitive, but when I graduated from high school, I had the fifth highest score in the school. Pretty good, everyone expects me to do well. I also did well in some entrance exams and got into a top university, studying CompSci.But that is where the happiness stops. The university is terrible at teaching, and that demotivated me from studying the subjects all by myself. The result? Terrible. My grades dropped. But still, they were not that terrible in my first year. I had a fail grade in one subject which I cleared. But then, that one fail grade completely demotivated me. I stopped paying attention to classes, and eventually stopped going to them. My friends and some of the better professors would ask me what is wrong, and I would do my best to avoid them. Eventually, I was scared to even go out lest I will meet some of my classmates or teachers. And the result was obvious, I failed all the classes that semester.Now, I was too scared to tell this to my family. They were bad enough when I had one failed subject last time, and warned me that I will be not allowed to continue studying and waste their money if I just wanted to fail. So I showed a fake grade sheet. And yes, they want to see the grade sheet or they will not pay for the next semester. I thought I would maybe clear those subjects one by one and they would not know. But now the shame of missing most of the classes in the last semester caught up, and I realised I could not concentrate in the classes at all. No one would talk to me voluntarily, and they would just answer very short when I ask something, and sometimes will not even do that. So eventually, that semester got fucked too.And this happened the next time too. I failed most of the subjects and had to fake my grades. But the university had terminated me, and I had to appeal for them to reinstate me. They did, and I had to retake the previous years subjects. But I did not know anyone from the class, and again, could not concentrate. I had planned to kill myself in the end of summer semester 2020, but because of the pandemic, we had to go back home. Back home, I pretended to be attending lectures while doing something else on my laptop. The last year I attended exactly 0 classes.Of course, my family thinks I am studying, but I am not. Remember I said I loved to read? Now I cannot even fucking concentration on reading something. Every night when I sleep, I promise myself that I will start studying tomorrow, but that never happens. The moment I open my textbook or some website to study, I lose all motivation. I cannot do it.Today was supposed to be the day I graduate and receive my degree. My family does not know. And they are one phone call away from knowing. we are not too rich, we cannot afford a regular psychiatrist. And anyway, I will be the one blamed, because that is how it has always been here. If I score low in a paper, it is because I did not study enough, not because I had a fever. I had a fever because I am too lazy to study. What do you think I will get when I say ""I have been failing for three years, I have just been faking my grades.""? I do not even have enough skills to find a job, and no one wants to hire a student who failed three years and could not get help for himself. And academics was the only thing I was ever good at.Frankly, every night I pray that I will not wake up alive. I do not have the guts to slice my wrist or stab myself in the heart or hang myself or something else. I have came close to completing those things, but I just cannot do it. I have ruined my life, and I hate myself.",0

I have always feared I am a bad person, because voices ask me to wrong others. I am not a bad person, because I know what is right and wrong. I say no to the dark, and face away from the shadows.

Finding something to look forward to. Obviously last year was a struggle. 2021 brought very little optimism with it. The Jan 6th insurrection, in my mind, is only a minor precursor of what is to come. Something that I have seen coming for what feels like my entire life- climate change, political and social instability. Against my better judgement, I have a child now, who is the most important person in my life. But I cannot shield her from this. she is too young to be vaccinated against COVID but were expected to carry on as if everything is fine now. I love my husband dearly but he needs my attention all the time. Hes manipulative but I do not think he realizes it. I work from home but my boss is going to make me return to the office at the end of Summer and I do not want to. My mom is dying from cancer. My closest work friends wife is dying from cancer. My sister died of cancer seven years ago. My dog is getting to the end of his life. I have no friends and terrible insurance. I am struggling to find the reason I keep pushing on. I find no enjoyment in anything. Work is beyond stressful and my job is pointless. The stress and anxiety it causes is affecting everything in my life and my health. My husband does not make enough money to support us and I cannot take a pay cut. I just feel like the check he would get from my life insurance, after I end things will solve all of these problems. Struggling to find the reason to not pursue this path. 25 year battle is rearing its ugly head",0
"I am getting to the point where I want to end my life , you can judge me all you want but you do not know how I been struggling all these years, not to mention covid made it worse. I am on autopilot. I am done it is a rap .Case closed and really wish people would just let me die you know it is like the people keep on calling the cops on me when I try to go the overpass which just leads the mental hospital so no help it is like I do not get it why cannot people just let the person take their own life , it is their life godammmit! Its none of your business nor none of your rights . I am frustrated socially distanced mother passed, sister in Virginia, fake step mom, fake everything nothing is good I want to die I am tired of living I been fighting my whole fuckingg! Life and it never ends I am tired of always struggling and getting no where I am doing the hardest I can I only human not God . Why can God just let me die , why does he have to wake me up. I do not want to wake up , I want to be in a comaaaaa! I do not want to see the next day it is get worse by the minute What the point of living when nothing works out",1
"I thought if I post this here it may help someone who has not already heard this analogy. it is really simple but counsellors and therapists have shared this with me in the past. I think it helped me visualise how anxiety and depression affects a person's ability to function and face the challenges of life and explain it to others: 1. Take two cups and fill the first with a little bit of water, and the second half full.2. The first cup is a 'normal person', the second is someone who suffers with a mental health condition like anxiety, 3. For all of life's stresses - work stress, financial worries, family issues, health problems, having a bad day etc. - add a little water to each glass. do not stop pouring.4. Obviously, the second glass will begin to overflow first. If it is knocked, the contents will be more likely to spill the fuller the glasses are.5. For many people who have silent struggles affecting their mental OR physical health, their cup is already pretty full at their baseline.6. It does not take a lot for this cup to overflow or spill compared to others, but that does not mean the cup is completely incapable of holding any water.7. It might be necessary to make a few holes in the bottom of that cup to stop the cup from overflowing. Cup Analogy",0
"I have only been working at this place for a week and a half, but during and after work I am wanting to hang myself or jump off the nearest overpass. I was struggling with this same issue while i was in the Army. I mostly has to do with pass trauma and my ADHD, i had meds but since i tried to over dose on them they took them away and threw any i had left away. I have was enrolled in a psych ward over in Germany and it was a pretty good experience to take my mind off things. But now that I am back in the states I am worried on how the hospitals over here are like. The just seem to be recurring no matter what i do, I have been trying since i was 7 but i never really stopped. While i was overseas i was diagnosed with Major Depression and ADHD and have not really found a way to handle it besides dying. Anyways, i was told to resign from the job but ill still get my paycheck, so i will not have to worry about bills for a little bit till i find another job.P.S. if anyone knows a less stressful job that i could look into that would be much appreciated. Just tried hanging myself at work today",1
"i do not really believe the idea that it ever gets better. I am about to finish school, i have no friends, life sucks and all I have ever heard and been told is that it gets better. its quite irritating and I am tired of waiting for it to get better because clearly it never does when is life supposed to be good?",0
"I am working 35+ hours a week and still not making enough to get by. I have $50,000 student debt, almost $10,000 medical debt, no home, no health insurance. I need new shoes. I need glasses. I have not seen a doctor or dentist in 10 years. What is the point of all this if I am working myself to live in misery and hopelessness? I have a college degree and lots of experience and I cannot get a better paying job anywhere. Besides that I am now finding I am sucking at my job because of the depression and general feeling that nothing can get better. I do not know what else to do. Thanks for listening. end of my rope",1
"I hate my life, i hate my job, i hate my body, everyone hates me. My best friend (my cousins german shepherd) was put down in november. it is getting so hard to keep going. Zoloft does fuck all, Prozac does fuck all.. I just want to sleep and die in my sleep. I am living the same day and week over and over again. Therapy is useless... Why me.. Why? What did i do wrong?",0

"I am sorta venting, but Its a feeling of emptiness, as far as I remember I have always been this way, never knew what i wanted in life and was never really sure of what and who i am, just going from place to place, my reaction to most things has always been i do not know, I do not know why I am thinking about this now but i think maybe its part of the reason why I have been depressed since ninth grade. How do you deal with this?",0
"Idk how much longer I am going to be able to stand living like this. I have been taking antiemetics for the past few days and am ready to take SN and get this over with. Might post again, might not. Hope you all have a better one, I just needed to get this off my chest. I have all the pieces",1
"i have money saved for this, but every time i have to spend hundreds of dollars all at once just to be healthy and sane i feel like its not even worth it to liveif i spend all my life working to make this money and its all taken away in a second just because i have mental and physical health problems. not to mention the job that i work to make that money exacerbating my problemswhats the point. I am just rolling a boulder that will crush me flat. everything i work for and earn will be taken from me in the end by people who do nothing but sit there and only think about how to make more money off of the little people like me. a penny to them, my life savings to mei want to quit everything medical bills make me want to die",1
I am so done with life. After I get my degree I am shooting myself. I cannot take this anymore. Life is the greatest illusion. I just want everything to end,1
"Everyone pities me and looks down at me for my mental illnesses and I cannot stand it anymore. I am tired of being labeled weird or awkward. It is hurtful. It is disheartening. I got fired from my job and I know its because I was not outgoing enough. It took me weeks to manage up the courage to work, it took everything just to go to work, and I was so proud! And now I am so embarrassed. All those looks of pity when my coworkers grouped up and gossiped while I was left out. The blank stares people gave me when something I said came out wrong or the annoyed looks people gave me when I could not stop fidgeting. I thought it would be worth it, because hey, I have a job and I am going out my comfort zone, right? Well now what? What the fuck did I gain but embarrassment and confirmation that I am not good enough and no one will ever understand or accept me. My Rant",0
"Id be lying if I said I have not been thinking about suicide for a while now. Growing up black, gay AND muslim my life has been beyond miserable in the sense everywhere I go have to worry about if people are going to be either racist homophobic islamphobic to me and my family being poor and extremely conservative demanding muslims does not help at all. It just feels like my lifes a constant struggle and having a traumatic childhood and highschool experience that made me lose a lot of self esteem and confidence really fucked me up. I always feel this looming pressure to be someone I am not and it just stresses me out. Why did I have to go through this life it feels like there is no going up from here and I am only 18. I cannot stand living on this earth any longer and my thoughts throughout the day just consist of trying to minimalise the importance of my existence so that it would be easier for me to leave this world. I have been having these thoughts for a while now and they just get stronger with time. Is there anything I should try doing before I completely end it all? Suicide feels like my only escape",1

"I am tired of feeling like a burden to my partner and like these feelings bring them down. I am tired of living the daily life we have. There is no point. I am only waiting around to feel better or different and if it ever happens it is a huge risk because half the time I feel like a disappointment. Like, I am feeling better so that makes everyone around me happy but inevitably I will let them down the next time I get sad or depressed. it is not worth it. I just sat in a bathtub and cut my arm and I realized how easy it would be to just do it for real. My partner and I have been fighting all day about how I feel and how they are trying their best and I am trying mine but I am tired of fighting. I do not trust any of my thoughts and feelings. I really do not think I mean enough to any of the people in my life that this would really matter. I do not feel like I have the time or patience to wait for a medication that works. I am tired. I just want to go. I think I may really kill myself tonight",1
"Within an hour I can go from feeling sad, to feeling nothing, then to feeling okay. Its constantly like this and it keeps switching I do not know why. I hate this",0
"Last year I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 1,5 years. After that I felt terrible for few months. Then I got better and better. Thought I found happiness that I have been longing for five years to come. Was actually enjoying my life, had a lot of fun. Now it is getting worse again.I do not enjoy binging movies, playing games or skating anymore. I hate to see my friends. I do not have the energy to talk with them. I feel bad that they have not even contacted me yet. It might be a lil dramatic but one ""are you ok?"" would be enough. I lay in my bed or stay on my computer all day. I do not smile. I do not feel happy. I am not suicidal but I think about death a lot. I do not want to kill myself but I want to die, vanish away. I went rowing a boat with my friend a few weeks ago. I was looking at the water thinking about what it would feel like to drown. I do not see a bright future ahead. When I was younger I thought I would be dead by now. Surprise, I am still here and now I have no idea what to do. I have no bright future.What the fuck should I do? I am getting numb",0
"I have been in a relationship for 9 years with a woman I thought I was going to marry, nine years later I feel as she is the reason I feel like I want to end my life. over nine years we have been on and off mostly on but we have broken up 4 times in those years. Always because I could not deal with her undiagnosed bipolar. She had finally got diagnosed four years ago but refuses to take meds but last year she got pregnant with our second child her third. After she gave birth she decided she was going to take meds for her anxiety bc it could be a stresser to her bipolar issue did so for three months then she fell pregnant again with our third her fourth child and has been told to get off her meds. So for the past 13 weeks she had been off her meds and it has been extremely hard due to her bringing up things that have happened in our relationship over the years but she always brings them back up and last year when she was pregnant I screwed up more then I ever have and was talking to another woman thousands of miles away sexually. But have since realized I was wrong and I really do love this woman but for the past few months it has been very hard to not give in to my depression. She bully's me and tells me I am worthless and fat and lazy and I do not make enough I do not do enough I do not help enough I do not do enough for my kid I do not give her enough time to just do her. I get she is mad but last week she went four days of being nice and saying she hurt me as much as I hurt her so why continue and said she was done. And for the last five days she has been treating me like shit again but really attacking my depression and making sure I want to end my life then says no one cares you do not have anyone that cares about you. Idk what to do we have three kids and i have no one to go to or anywhere to crash for a few days and neither does she and it has been like that for our whole relationship so idk how to progress our relationship or my mental and I just keep going back to the things she says. How to realize I am the problem",1
"I recently had a manic episode that led to me doing some extremely reckless and irresponsible things. I maxed out some credit cards, blew all my savings on stupid subscriptions and got back into a bad drug habit after previously quitting years ago. As a result, all the hard work that my SO and I have put in over the last year or so was thrown out the window and our relationship fell apart. After they finally called it quits and told me we were through, I ended up at the hospital where I got my bipolar diagnosis. I feel like I am waking up after a bad dream but it is slowly sinking in that it was all real. Now I am stuck living with the aftermath and I do not know how to cope. I lost my home and my partner (the best support system I ever had prior to my mania) and now I am back living with my parents as a grown adult. My ex is understandably traumatized and hurt by the whole experience. Although the bipolar diagnosis provided some answers, the whole experience has definitely left a bad taste in their mouth and it is sadly clear that we are done.How do you cope with this guilt? Knowing that I basically put a knife through the dreams we had together? Now I have to live the rest of my life on meds and various therapies and on top of that, I have lost the person I truly loved. I feel no reason to continue. Even if time will lessen the pain, I just feel as if I will never go over this. I just have this strong feeling inside of me that eventually I will just end it. Maybe not today or tomorrow. But someday. I am going to write a letter stating all the ways I messed up and how sorry I am for all of it. I need everyone to understand how ashamed I am of how it all turned out. I really have nothing left to offer the world but pain and chaos. I have disappointed my love, my family and my friends. Atleast the time we had together was fun. I have no intention of seeing the end of 2021 through. I Ruined My Life. I Have Nothing Left To Live For",1
"I am not sure why, but i feel empty and disconnected. like I am not myself. nothing has substance anymore, i cannot talk to my friends without this sinking feeling that they think I am not funny/an idiot. i wish i could just die so i did not have to deal with myselflike i said, I am not sure why i feel this way. i was fine just a few days ago disconnected",0

"I am a drug abuser (benzos and meth mostly) and have been diagnosed with schizophrenia 11 years ago. My psychosis is getting worse although my drug use is ceasing. I dissociate heavily and I barely even feel like I am a real person typing this. The voices and visual hallucinations are constant, but worst at night when I am alone and not doing anything. My best friend barely talks to me anymore and its killing me to think that I care more about her than she does about me. Worth mentioning I am kind of in love with her. She was the best at calming me down in severe episodes of psychosis and was always so patient and caring and gentle. And now that I do not have her in my life anymore, its tempting me to use drugs to cope with the depression which I know will make the schizophrenia worse so its a lose/lose. Every night now I lay in bed and listen to the voices telling me awful things about myself, usually in the voices of people I know, worst of all, in the voice of my dad who passed away 4 years ago that I never grieved over because I was so out of it on drugs. I feel so alone and I get so scared at night because I have been known to dissociate and black out and harm myself, coming inches from killing myself, literally (I had a gun pointed at my temple and the trigger was being slightly pulled, came to just before the bang). I constantly struggle with the decision of whether I want to live the rest of my life trying to deal with this horrible disorder, or if I want to just say game over and call it quits. I do not really have a point to this, I just needed to rant. I need help",0
"About two months ago I was out of state to visit my friend of 10 years (well say M) and i stayed for 2 weeks. During this time I was fighting with my boyfriend and she was instigating hard along with her mother which then put me in a place to break up with him. We got back together 20 minutes later knowing this is not something that can be done from another state like this, and M being disappointed in me says do not worry, when you break up when you get back you can come stay with us again. this did not sit right with me because she said When. So a week after my trip while I am home she stops responding to me for about a month, then out of nowhere sends a huge paragraph about how my boyfriend is breadcrumbing me and isolating me from my friends. She said this because when she texts me i take a couple hours to respond. M is however notorious for not responding for days weeks or months. Since over a month ago I have not had any connection with her other than the one message. I responded but she still has not. My friend of 4 years (b) I did not usually hang out much but since my relationship was becoming more steady and we were learning to take out time apart I started hanging out with her more often. She lives about 45 minutes from me but i did not mind since i enjoy the ride. Around a month ago my boyfriend had broken up with me and was very shitty about it, i was sure it was going to be the last time. So i went to Bs place for comfort and to calm down. She makes me promise not to get back with him, and her boyfriend who was also my friend gave me a whole lecture on why my boyfriend is a pos. Naturally I went back to my boyfriend (G) anyway. we have broken up plenty but only gave our belongings back twice or so. Our relationship is more dramatic than anything, we know that but to my friends its abusive. I have reason to believe M and B just wanted me to listen to them. To be in control of me. My boyfriend is nothing like how they portray him. However that is the reason they cut me off, was because i took him back. Most people have just given me the advice of hanging out with family instead but everyone knows the difference between a friend and sibling. I do not have a close relationship with them seeing as i do not do well with the brutal honesty and bluntness of their personalities. The conversation will always come down to why I am so full of excuses when they ask about my mental health. Recently I have been spiraling in my depression and i genuinely have nobody to go to other than my boyfriend but your partner cannot help everything. My social life is important to me and watching my boyfriend be harassed and loved by all of his friends makes me feel so pathetic. I decided to start going to the gym alone to help dilute the feelings but it just makes me lonelier that i have no one to talk to. I have always attracted people who take me for granted or want to control me because I am easy or impressionable.I also suffer from PCOS and I am supposed to be getting a diagnoses for bipolar. All of these things are putting me in a position of feeling like id be better off in a psych ward. Not for protection, but so that i will not be a burden on anyone or myself anymore. I have been inpatient before and while its not fun it will make everyone else happy. I lost everyone.",0
"Its been months since I have had a panic attack (before any therapy) and I just feel so numb, I know this might sound offensive in some manner but I just want to feel pain.

I just ask for advice from people who have been through this before.. the desperately wanting of at least a panic attack. Please excuse my grammar mistakes. Wanting to have a panic attack",0

I held a knife in my hand today and cried. I wanted to slit my throat and wrists in the shower. I am just unlovable and miserable.

"About a week and a half ago, I was in the middle of a road trip, and the main plan was to go skydiving for our first time. I went with my roommates, a couple, and we did.Well, sort of. My roommate did not jump. it is whatever, but maybe not totally. Anyways, his girlfriend and I did jump.During the wait, and the climb, and when we were about to drop, I was nervous. But I was determined to do this for myself so that is what I did. As we plunged out of the plane (my instructor; tandem), we dropped for maybe 30 seconds free fall, pulled the chute, and floated to the ground. I initially thought it was crazy. Insane. Thought there is a chance I might die if the chute failed. But it did not. And while we dropped, I was a *little* scared, but as I landed on the ground I found myself disappointed. While I was hoping to feel something really genuine, I really did not. What I felt was fear, sure, but not actually life threatening fear, and had no adrenaline for doing it. I now, a week and a half later, feel as if I have done nothing in the past two weeks.Can I not feel something real? Is this all just an idea I foster for myself, that I can feel true excitement again? Or is it a lie? Can I really not feel things for what they are now? I have so many questions that I cannot answer, yet I cannot even bring myself to a counselor to figure this out.I do not know anymore. I expect nothing good from this, to be honest. I jumped out of a plane and found out I am more dead inside than I would originally thought",0
"My older brother is taller than me at 511~60. My little brother is taller than me at 60. Me? I am only 58.5 (doctors measurement). I know its close to average but I cannot stand being the shortest anymore.I thought I got a hold of my depression and suicidal thoughts by working out and losing 57 lbs, graduating college with a job lined up, eating properly, practicing mindfulness but none of it helps when I see them every day and cannot help thinking about my inferior genes. Why was it me that had to be the shortest? Why was it me that had to be the most dark skinned? Why was it me who got the most health issues? This is a cruel fucking world... I am just glad my sodium nitrite will be here soon. Bye everyone. Goodbye everyone, its been a fun ride",1

"I am thinking of getting escort for the first time but I am still a little hesitant. I was hoping to hear some of your experiences, if it was worth it or not, how to set it up/pay, etc.Ideally I would like to put it on a credit card since I do not have that much cash. Is that even an option? Like would they charge it as some ""massage"" service and allow me to pay with card? Or would it be cash only? Has anyone here hired an escort? Was it worth it?",0
"As the days go on I get more and more numb at the thought of suicide. Its Thursday and I have been numb since Sunday. I went to the beach at night and I just wanted to jump in so bad. Right in front of my friends. Monday I slept all day and thought about what I would put in my note. At least I made something. Tuesday I could not sleep and when I took my daily meds, I had a horrifying episode. I went to the mental hospital but of course they would not take me. I talked with my friends but I just felt like a burden the whole time. Why does everything always have to be about me. Wednesday I try to recover from my injuries from the day before. Partner buys me medical supplies to help and then gets upset because he does not know how to support me. We contemplate breaking up. Today is Thursday, woke up fine. Crocheting my friends stuffed frogs as a thank you for being my friend gift. I already said I wanted to die in the group chat to no response, I guess they thought I was joking. I reach out to my partner and tell him I am going back to bed because I cannot handle life today. No response. I guess I fucked that up too. I am so alone. Nobody wants anything to do with me because I am a burden. Praying that one of my friends or even my partner reaches out to me for comfort. I need it so bad, I feel lost and alone with nowhere to go but bed. Maybe I just need to face the fact that I will always be alone no matter what. Its been so long",0
"If my mom tells me my depression is fake and I am only doing it when things do not go my way just because i do not go out with her other family, what do i do? she is told me that when we went on a two day vacation last week, i did not look or seemed depressed so I must be faking it. An hour ago we when to walk in the park and she asked me if I wanted to go to a water park with my little sisters and i say no thank you, she gave me her usual snarky reply ""well i cannot obligated you to go"" however this time I had enough and i ask her ""why do you always have to give me a reply like that"" ""why cannot you just accept my no and move on"" then she started scolding me and so i walked away so i did not burst into a argument with her like we do everyday and told her I will met her in the car while she finished her lap. When we got in the car she told me that she is done with me and she is not going to talk to me anymore just like my father does (recently moved to my mom's because I was going to attempt suicide at my dad's, however my dad does not know anything about my depression and i do not feel comfortable yet moving back/taking to him about it) as well as telling me that I must have a strong hate for everyone since i cannot co exist with anyone if things do not go my way. She told me I am an awful daughter and that no one will love me because I have so much hate inside of me. And that i do not love her or anyone in this life. And continued telling me that what my feelings are without ever asking me once what my truth feelings are. Then she kept pointing out that I am a ""cabrona"" (bitch in Spanish) and that I am going to fail in life if i do not drastically change myself. I have nothing going for me, i currently do not go to school, do not have a job, and do not have friendsAnd since that is what society values I am basically nothing and a piece of shit and a bitch as my mom says.So suicide seems like my best option since my only option of hope just told me to figure it out because she is not going to be in my life unless i do not make the effort to be a good daughter in her eyes. Last Resort I have no one else",0
"about a year ago, i made a half-assed attempt at an OD and ended up in the hospital for the night. when they asked me what had happened, i said that it was an accident and, no, i was not trying to kill myself. and despite how obviously emotionally unstable i was, they all either believed me and did not care to call my bluff. even my family did not see through my bs. neither the hospital psychiatrist nor my psychiatrist seemed to care enough to really look deeper. i know it is unfair to blatantly lie and expect people to see through it, but still. it is made me think about just how much I have lied to people. with most of the people i know, I have lied to them so much that how i am when I am lying just seems normal to them. and i think i keep doing it because it insulates me. but I have cut myself (and my ability to talk to other people about my feelings) so far off that it seems impossible to get out of it. i cannot even cry out for help anymore because I have isolated myself so that no one can tell. i feel like I have neutered my ability to be known. I have trapped myself in here alone the cries for help do not even work anymore",1
"I just need to rant for a second. feel free to not respond or do, idrc. but i just think its so unfair that some people have a genuinely good life with great, loving, supporting parents and their only problems in life is, for example boys. meanwhile I am stuck with shitty parents, my moms a drug addict and my dad is a recovered (idrk anymore) drug addict who is in and out of jail every month. I never see any of them anymore and they never even try to see me. like they are my PARENTS, how could they not want to see their daughter. and when my mom was living with us (i live at my grandmas) she let us her abusive psychotic bf into our house, knowing hes not allowed. her ex bf actually broke into my grandmas house a few weeks ago and broke my moms door. I just do not know what to do anymore, on top of all that i suffer from depression and anxiety and bpd and an ed. its just so hard and now i have to work all the time so i can afford my own apartment because my grandma is selling the house in a few months and already found a new place. (cannot move in with her because she is living somewhere for the elderly) i just feel like complete shit right now, I am not going to kill myself but damn i truly never expected my life to be this fucking bad. i just have nobody except one friend but i do not want to rant to them all the time, I am sure it gets very annoying. well i have to work early tmr so imma end this here, thank you if you read this far. and if you did not, well I am really not surprised like I am literally being that bitch that just trauma dumps but i just cannot hold shit in much longer.

"I feel like nothing in my life is going right. I have a lot to be grateful for but even gratitude is not making things any better. Both of my parents are dying, my boyfriend is ignoring me and I am sure he is going to leave me, I feel stuck in a town I hate, and I got into a car accident today. I just want to swallow a bunch of pills or cut myself until I bleed out to death. I made a promise to myself that I would wait 48 hours and then call emergency. I do not know why I am posting this here. Maybe I am looking to get validated. it is easier to seek that out from strangers rather than bothering your friends. I am getting closer to my breaking point",1
"I know this post is going to be very sudden and very random (especially for someone who has joined reddit now), but I have been thinking about doing this for a while, so that is what I am going to do. The post is basically what the title says, if you need a friend, I am here :). I know what it is like to deal with this constant pain, and how lonely we feel. I constantly feel a need to express what I feel and talk to someone who could maybe understand what it is like to feel the weight of the universe on your shoulders. So if you need to rant about how you feel, or just want to make a new friendship, I am more than willing! I would love to make new friends, especially with people who probably understand me. PS: I do not know if this kind of information is important (it probably is), but I am a 16 year old girl. If you need a friend",0
I am experiencing a deep personal depression due to the circumstances I am finding myself in. I am taking medications but its simply not changing the fact that I live in a fucked up country and horrible things are happening all the time. What the hell am I supposed to do about it? I am lost and I need help hope this does not get removed but will not be surprised. what am i supposed to do?,0
"I have been alone for a long time. do not have any siblings or extended family, just my mom and dad. Everyone else is dead or out of my life. I think during my childhood was the only time I ever had real friends around me that genuinely cared. But when I was 11 we moved to a brand new country, so I had to leave all of those friendships behind. I have not been able to make a single genuine bond since, just some ""friends"" you joke around with sometimes, hang out, grab drinks. I put ""friends"" in quotation marks because none of them really care all that much. They never ask how I am, say they missed me, or show interest in me or my life in general. And I am pretty sure if I went missing today, they would not even notice.Anyway, I stay at a flat with 6 other people. Amongst them is a girl around my age. I was too shy to ever go up and talk to her but I have always found her very attractive. One day she came up to me and added me to a group chat where we could organise stuff to do with all the other flatmates, or just talk about things in general (or complain when someone did not wash their dishes or something).Anyway, it slowly blossomed into a friendship between me and her. We understood each other, we got along, we talked, we even started relying on each other for emotional support sometimes. It got to the point where she would come to my room almost every day and we would just talk about anything, stay up all night and watch movies. She bowled her eyes out next to me watching Princess Kaguya. It was great. For a while I completely forgot that I was alone. She started becoming the person I looked forward to seeing. She filled that gap for me. I guess as a result of that it was inevitable that this infatuation would turn into romantic interest on my end. But she did not return my feelings, and now she is seeing someone else. I tried to be respectful about it, I told her that I would probably find it a bit hard to stay friends (and I do not feel bad for saying that as it is the honest truth) and I have been distancing myself to give her space.But now I am alone again. Her life is going on like nothing ever happened, because she never needed me in the first place. I was the one that needed her. I keep checking my phone every day, thinking maybe she will reach out to me eventually, maybe our friendship did mean more to her and she misses me. But every day that goes by confirms to that it is not true. So now I am alone. Being alone before sucked. It was painful. But I was also used to it, it is all I knew, so I learned to cope. Now that I have had a taste of what real friendship - what love feels like. I cannot go back anymore. It hurts too much.it is impacting every aspect of my life. I am not eating properly. I stopped going to work. I am not finding fun or enjoyment in the things I used to. I do not know what to do or how much longer I can go on.I just wish my family did not love me so much. Then there would be nothing stopping me, nobody I would hurt by ending it all So tired if being alone",0
"Why live? It will not get better it is an incurable illness. You can stanch it with drugs, but that does not sound like living to me. Some of us here know we will eventually take ourselves out its just a matter of time, but the wars over and we are fighting a lost battle When your permanent state is depression",0
well to be honest I do not even know why I am here but I just need somewhere I can voice my thoughts as I feel like they are building in my head to the stage that I would rather talk to my self than others. it may sound like I am exaggerating right but I spend soo much time alone that even when I am with others id rather not be. this is my fault either I was such a funny kid (class clown) so popular in school and even after I finished school too. but that all changed when I was shipped over seas by my mum. I cannot lie and say know I do not see that it was for my benefit I could have simply died had I stayed there and for a parent that is enough reason. but to send me somewhere like that and treat me the way they did really stripped me for humanity. I saw things I should not have and that is when the thoughts started. I was locked up for about 7 months over seas as my family thought it would help me but there is where I create a version of life in my head and know I cannot escape it. my life is finally going good I have worked soo hard for that but mentally I am suffering soo much. I cannot tell anyone this in real life because why would humans care. they never cared when I really needed them and know it feels like if they do care is because they want something. and also I promised my self that I will never be vulnerable again in this life which is another reason I can never tell anyone. so I smile at the few people I do see but in saying ALLL OF THIS I do want to make friends and there is apart of me that wants to be accepted in someone is life as I really feel like I have never belonged. I would love some tips or maybe books to read that may help me. I REALLY FEEL LIKE I AM DROWNING Why I made this account,0
"I am a 23 year old female and I have been struggling with motivation since I was fourteen, but it continues to get worse and worse. At this point, I cannot find the motivation to do the simplest tasks like replying to texts, making doctors appointments, filling out job applications, and taking my medicine. I have always been really smart, so much so that I managed to get into a pretty good college despite having a 2.7 GPA in high school. I did not do a single assignment last semester and ended up getting almost all Fs. The weirdest part is that I do not feel depressed. I have no motivation to do anything, but I am pretty content with my lifestyle of laying in bed, watching TV, and eating. Granted, it makes me feel like shit to do absolutely nothing, but I am not particularly unhappy with it. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD but have not had a depression diagnosis since I was in my younger teenage years. I am starting to fear so much for my future. I have terrible grades in school and I cannot even manage to apply for a job. My life is literally in shambles and I am having panic attacks almost daily because of it. I am really sick of living like this. Does anybody else struggle with this and if so, have you found anything that helps? I am starting to think that Ill be stuck like this for the rest of my life. I have no motivation to do even the smallest tasks.",0

Just wondering if there is any link to the two of them and does anybody else here have this too? I have had depression for ages but what I noticed is how I can listen to the same song over and over again not get sick it. Also rewatching certain tv episodes over and over again to the point where I am questioning my own sanity. Depression causing obsessions?,0
"I am 15 years old and I feel like shit. Even though its summer i feel like nothing fucking matters anymore. I recently took a trip to see family, on this trip I saw my cousin who was in town for a volleyball tournament and my older brother who lives here. The trip was an absolute disaster, I fucked up my friendship with my cousin cuz of something I do not even remember saying and the week alone I was supposed to have with my brother got ruined because I got everyone sick, my dad is mad at me for a shit ton of reasons and i feel like an absolute piece of shit. I do not know what to do at this point. I do not have any friends, I am basically all alone and I just feel like no one cares. I feel awful",0
I do not have anyone to say goodbye to in person. So goodbye. Goodbye...,1
"No matter what I do or attempt to do I am always back to feeling sad all the time. No amount of motivation or talk is helping me cope with this pathetic life I live. I procrastinate everything, I do not stand up for myself, I hate my job, I am worthless, I am meaningless there is no point to my life. Living onward is just as painful as wanting to die I JUST cannot ANYMORE",0
"I am completely lost at this point. I finished school, got a diploma in hospitality management and realised it was a complete waste and have no interest in that industry anymore. Now I am 20 floating around minimum wage jobs lost af. I just feel like time is running out and am heading nowhere in life. I do not know what career I want to do and am to scared to take the jump. I feel like there are infinite paths infront of me and each lead somewhere but I am to scared I will pick the wrong one like I did with hospo. I tell myself I am trying to take it slow and figure it out so I do not rush into anything bad, But doing nothing makes me feel so empty and voided. Expecicialy that most people around me have some career there working towards. Completely lost in life at 20years old",0
"i know id die if i were to take too much of my medication. last year i was so suicidal and like I am in a really bad place again, like everyday its just getting so much worse. i remember i wrote so much on my other account last year on this subreddit, back when things were horrible, and i know sooner or later i will end up trying to do it., knowing it will work. i just know that one day i will do it because things will get so bad. and everything has just been horrible lately and i really do not want to be in this bad place but i just cannot get myself to feel better i just cannot i feel so miserable and upset and i hate myself. i hate the fact that getting better is not permanent. when i thought my life was getting better it really was not. i hate the fact that I am supposed to be happy right now but I am the opposite. sorry for the vent lol things r getting worse again",1
"For the record, I am not suicidal and I never have been. But I am going to tell you something, a true story, that might make you think another way.For background, My mom's friend, who I will call ""Susan"" speaks Russian and English, so she works in translation at hospitals in the you.S.Susan had a client, who I will call ""Sandra"" was living in Russia. Sandra's son, living in America told her to come live with him there. She at first declined, saying Russia was were her friends and job were. But after a while, she agreed. But when Sandra lived here, she fell in a deep depression. She did not fit in, she did not like her job. She would spend a lot of time just watching TV. Sandra starts feeling suicidal, not caring about life. Always saying she wants to die. She becomes isolated, smoking and occupying her time with herself. Smoking a lot. After a while, she visits her friends in Russia. They tell Sandra they are worried about her cough. Sandra brushes it off as a little side-effect of smoking. Returning to the you.S., Sandra's son expresses the same concern. She says the same thing, but they decide to take her to a doctor. Inoperable, Incurable Stage 4 Lung Cancer.Instantly, her whole attitude changes.The amount of time she spent hating life, not caring, she regrets it. She realizes how important it is, and what she has. She has a few months left to live. And she appreciates it so much more.My point to you is this: I do not know what you are going through. I do not know how you feel. But I know that if you push past pain and try, and maybe you will have to try hard; to try hard to appreciate life, you will enjoy life. You will not regret hating life and feeling like you do not matter, like Sandra did. Because like her, you will come to regret it.I hope this reaches out to you, and guides you to a better place. Some advice",1
"I dealt with depressing now for 40 years. Only started seeking therapy since 2010. It took me a long time time to admit and accept that I had Clinny D. I always viewed it as a weakness, a flaw in my character. That is until one day I found myself in a locked, darkened room at work, curled up in the fetal position suffering from an anxiety attack. That cannot happen, not in my profession. that is what drove me to seek help. Two therapists and three different antidepressants later, I realized that I had the answer all along. You see, I am an introvert, an INFP to be exact. That means I spend a lot of time thinking, a *lot* of time, like every second of every day. it is like my brain is seeking information, to be challenged, and if it does not get it, it starts to think of other things. that is where my problems lie; I think *too* much. Let to its own devices, my mind starts thinking about the past, about the mistakes I made, the pain of being teased, taunted, and ostracized. I need to keep my mind occupied. that is when it struck me; I need to keep busy doing things that occupy my brain so that it cannot think of anything else but the task at hand. So now, in order to keep it distracted, I *do* things, like clean the house, mow the lawn, clear the yard, work on clearing it the garage so I can get my Camaro in, doing Sudoku. Anything that requires me to think, plan, improvise, solve. And guess what? It works. It really works. I hope some people here will find this piece of advice helpful. You do not need to be excellent at something, or even good. Just find something that will challenge and occupy your brain. Do a jigsaw puzzle, chop wood, calculate the air speed of an unladen swallow (big Asian and European). Any thing. Give it a try, a *real* try, and see what happens. Best of luck to everyone. We may be in separate paths, but we are all in this together. (Advice) How I deal with depression",0

"lost my girlfriend a few days ago the only two reasons i got was she does not want a relationship and she wants to work on herself I have just been sittint downstairs playing xbox for most of the days because my room reminds me of her.we broke up on the 5th of july and I have literally got no friends and nothing she made my insecurities feel like a artwork my face, my ears, my stretch marks she just made me feel handsome all my friends online just tell me to move on but how can i? i wanted a future with this girl and she wanted one too she hid a lot of stuff until last moment and wrote how she felt in the iphone notes app me and her just normally text once or twice a day for 6 minutes or so and leave it like that but the past two days I have been bugging her because I am on the angry stage of a breakup but we had this spotify playlist and i just listen to it and feel special and not even that i just find myself watching when she was last active on instagram I am driving myself to suicide and literally cut my arm up with a school pin a few minutes ago because i like the feel of pain and to see blood rush out of my armi need advice honestly i do not know anymore",1
"I used to be able to sleep fine when it was not as bad but now its like I am suddenly constantly awake every night staring at my ceiling because the all the depression and stress make it impossible to sleep, I cannot even do anything to pass the time because everything is so boring and bland and flavourless to me and I cannot text anyone because I have no friends, the only way I can get a little bit of sleep is if I take strong sleeping pills which basically just feel like I am being drugged to sleep.

"M 17. I hate that I am writing this right now. Especially on reddit of all god damn places. regardless of that, I want to die. for years, the first thought that conceives itself in my mind when I awake is death. I am over it. its especially weird because I know I have happy moments in this life of mine, yet they do not suffice. It makes me upset. I try so hard to survive and push through yet my head just keeps feeling the way it does. I have been through years of therapy, and months of psych ward experience; I still crave death. The thing that breaks my heart the most is that I can recognize my happier moments, yet I still am so unhappy. Normally, I would treat these positive instances as progress, but they are not solely because I am still left with the same emptiness that I had before. Besides all of that, Imma save up some money to hire a hitman on myself. I have already done the research, I know where to look, all i need now is the money.Hopefully the next life I live holds better things. Ill be gone soon. Thanks for listening to this bullshit. I want to hire a hitman on myself",0
"Well, 3 girls, I have ever managed to date me but I only managed them because I find out, later on, they just circumstantial I guess? Just as a why not but never like yeah this is suitable which is bad... Like they kind of start to obsess over me in the honeymoon phase but then once it is gone bye-bye from there on out you know what else is kind of lonely I have friends but since I go to a lot of events etc. they all think I got a lot of friends so no one really reaches out to me... I do not know what I am doing anymore I wish I was white too. Might have better chances with girls being brown, guys lemme tell you the number of times I have had girls say to me their parents thinking my people are creepy so they cannot date a brown guy and that they must be dodgy so it is ingrained in them so they are kind of on edge around me when I am not even like... doing anything bad I am just talking or having fun honestly. I am just a gamer who does not even get mad I am so numb at this point in regards to being depressed I just let go of everything or just accept blame when it is not even my fault because I feel nothing towards it at this point I still think what hurt the most was when two of my friends had new friends and they were saying watch out for me as if I was a predator because of my skin color when in reality I am just an easy going guy and they were like do not sit next to him and watch out for him I am like eh? And just have to laugh it off... I am not dangerous just kind of sucks that this stuff happens so I am tired of trying to find another person but I would love to get married honestly it is a dream of mine as lame as that sounds and I honestly do not go around trying to force girls to date me etc. I am just at a point where I know it will not happen for me what is the point it would be nice but yeah I just know some people are destined to be alone and here I am on Reddit The last girl I liked kind of strung me along for years so lost years of my life on that which was my fault I was too weak to let go but she talked to me and stuff even when she had a bf I was always there, always.

"People love and care for me and I know that. And I do not deny it. I just do not want to be alive. I do not want to wake up, eat, go to work, distract myself from the emptiness life truly is. Not just that. I am also psychotically depressed. I do not know who I am anymore when I am not convinced I have to die for some reason and I am the ""chosen"" one who has to free myself from my ""physcial existence"". it is as if suicide is something people actually desire, they just do not know how freeing it is bc they have an illusion that life is better than death. Also, I do not even know who I am. I feel mentally dead. I do not think for myself, I do not understand how people make money and survive if it is not a corporate slave job where they have masters who have all the power and say. I have not been in school because I have been in hospitals *AT LEAST* 2 times a year. So there is no point in ""getting better"" bc I am just not going to. I died years ago when I was 13. Mentally first. Then ""spiritually"". Now my physical existence must go. People care and value life and that is the only reason I am not killing myself bc I do not want to shatter their illusion",1
"Every since I started working at a factory I was depressed. I could not handle it anymore so I decided to quit and try agricultural job, as a part-time, in the very country side of my country.

"Hello, I have (22F) struggled with my mental health since I was very young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20.I have never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality they are just joking around. A lot of people do not like me because of that, I seem really mean but I am not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cannot. Lately I have been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When I am having a good day I feel amazing, I am productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean (from self harm) for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cannot stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. I just want to disappear but I do not want to kill myself because I do not want my family to suffer. TL;DR: I do not know if I am depressed or not, I have motivation a lot of days but some days I become suicidal and I think its all because of my anxiety I can feel happy some days and other days I want to die",0
"I am not drunk right now (which is getting less and less common these days), but I literally just unintentionally fell off the couch.In moments where I am especially sad I almost appear drunk to my roommates. I sing louder than I normally would to myself in a slurred voice, I stumble around, I have even just slowly lowered myself on the ground and laid there for a while. One of my roommates even went one morning, ""Dude. it is 10am"" and he had to check my room and the garbage to be convinced that I had not been drinking.Is this common? If it is, why does it happen? Is it normal to feel/act kind of drunk when in a really sad spell?",0

"I do not know what my life had become at this point, I do not feel like I am alive anymore. All I do is to pretend to be funny because that is the only thing that I remember about the old me. I am constantly running away from responsibility because I can barely get out of my bed. it is just constant state of emptiness, I cannot cry, I cannot feel happiness, the only emotions that I can still feel are jealousy &amp; anger. I miss having a personality. I do not know what I have become other than a lonely bitter person that is desperately trying to pretend to not be one. I no longer want to connect or form friendship with people because I always end up being manipulative &amp; hurting them. I am a she will of who I used to be, I do not have long term plans because I do not even know if I will be celebrating my 16th birthday. I cannot listen to anyone talking about what their future plans are because I know I will only be extremely hostile towards them because I am just jealous that they are not mentally ill &amp; have hope for their future, because I am barely alive at this point.

"I have never actually been actively suicidal, but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I did not have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that ""this will not last forever, it will all end some day"" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive. And growing up I navely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult did not even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I did not expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed. Now I am at a stage in life where I am still young, but I have managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am, borderline-alcoholic, depressed, used up and hating myself. Through my careless, self destructive lifestyle I have gotten myself a bad reputation, allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible, physically and mentally. I am scarred and damaged inside and out. I am a she will. I have gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I have destroyed so much I do not even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred, rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I cannot feel happiness, I cannot love. I cannot feel anything but shame, regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad. I am not considering suicide now, but part of me wishes that teenage me would have just ended things before this shitshow began, so I would not have to live down this long walk of shame. I thought there would be some kind of reward or feeling of pride at this point for fighting to stay alive. But all I get is more and more shit thrown at me. It never ends. Life just deteriorates and I feel like a zombie. I wish I had killed myself when I was a teenager",1

People do not want to hire me. People do not want to be my friend. People do not want to love me.My family makes it clear they think I am strange and are ashamed to be around me in public. They purposely leave me out, do not invite me,and make remarks about me that make me feel like shit.I know I am an odd person. There are small things I try to change about myself and improve upon. that is limited but dammit, I try.Its nobodys fault I am autistic, but it makes life feel unmanageable. People exclude you and feel weird about being around you.I have no passion or goal to keep me going. Everything feels pointless. Sometimes I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up.

I have tried to find things i like and stuff to keep me interested but its all temporary soon enough i forget about it and ill just start thinking about suicide.

Feeling so much for a girl is good, and better showing to her that. As a man, I like making a girl to smile. It makes me a better man, as a better person, because a girl's smile worth much more from my happiness. A happy girl's face, worth my soul. Worth me.... :) I need someone to read this",1
"i struggled with suicidal thoughts last year when covid first started. i had no hope in living, i could not see my friends, i could not play the sport i love, i could not see any of my family, i was stuck at home. it was a horrible experience for me. this past year ( 2021 ) have honestly been the best year of my life. i started getting back on track and realizing life is such a great thing and if i did commit i would miss out on everything. ever since, all i thought about was helping people get past their toughest stage in life and help them get back on track like i did and just honestly see how beautiful life is. suicide is a long term problem for a short term problem. if you ever need someone to talk to, reach out to me please. reach out please.",1
My aunt did a form of Persian palm reading on my hands and told me that Id have no lasting love or relationship in my lifetime. I am depressed not because of that but its funny because if I was neurotypical Id probably lose more sleep over that event. Now even if its true for me I shrug it off since I am too depressed to even prioritize that connection Anyways thanks for listening Its all just a simulation anyways When I was 10,0

I am not new to depression or suicidal thoughts I have always had some under lying thought or emotions about depression and suicide but as I have gotten older and started to learn more of myself I Have been diagnosed and have accepted that it is something I will most likely deal with for the remainder of my waking life. As I learn more and more everyday about this I keep finding myself in the same situation where the best way I can describe it is like something In my physical brain flips a switch from happy to emotional depresses and suicidal. I am just reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced Or is experiencing something like this and what you do to help your self cope with it.( sorry if this post its long winded or hard to understand I am not doing the best right now) I am new to depression.,0
"I wasted so much time in useless stuff such as gaming, porn and useless media that I have become a shitty being, I am starting to hate the fact no parent helped me develop myself when i was a child, now I am in my late teens and have no skills, talents and hobbies, I am so clumsy and dumb so even if i start something I am going to be so bad at it that I will be thinking about killing myself, if they helped me out i would not have made so much mistakes and have so much regrets in such age, i would be good at at least something and it would make things different because no matter how bad things are when you know that you are worthy and have reedeming traits to compensate your flaws it changes your entire perspective, it is different when you have no strengh or positive quality to be proud of, there is a masssive difference with being a person who has low self eestem and inferiority complex all in the mind and being actually bad at everything.Hell, even if sudenly things got better and i became a better person, i would still be behind most people of my age, fuck my life.

"If you know someone who is depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. Depression is not a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather.Try to understand the blackness, lethargy, hopelessness, and loneliness they are going through. Be there for them when they come through the other side. Its hard to be a friend to someone who is depressed, but it is one of the kindest, noblest, and best things you will ever do.Ashley Say No To Depression",0
"Hi Reddit. I just want to write down some thoughts about this night and I do not know where I can write it down. The last days and weeks were pretty rough. I was in a psychiatric hospital to stabilize my mood in a suicidal crisis for about 4 weeks. My Mum pressured to release me from the clinic because ""I have so much things to do"". I will be getting 18 in under two weeks. So I have to go to many doctor appointments and to the city hall etc. So I was released from the hospital. In the hospital I made the promise to myself that I would never ever say to my therapists or anyone else that has not been in this situation that I am permanently suicidal and think of it every time. Because then they are putting me in the closed section or even give me permanent contact to a nurse which means you are not even allowed to go to the toilet alone. (Just imagine having your peroid and changing your tampon or pad whilst someone is watching you...). But one of the worst parts is that you have nothing else to do as sitting in your room with a bed and a closed closet and a chair with a table. You may have a book or a little thing you will ""entertain"" yourself with. You are so bored. Occaisonally you are allowed to be in the group room, which has a tv and a radio and some games. But only, if you have not said that you are suicidal even though you are not about to kill yourself. You are so bored that you only think about how to get out of that situation. Either you successfully kill yourself or you do not say anybody something or you ""try"" to get better. So I think I have made the point why I do not want to tell my therapist about anything related to suicide. As I was released from the hospital I got my subscription for Fluoxetine, and I take it. One ,ajor issue for me is that if I have stress with my mum, i only can cope with cutting myself. It has gotten so deep, that i had to get stitches, so I had to tell my mum because she is the only one who has custody of me and the hospital is only allowed to sew my wound if she approves it. So I had to tell her. She does not know for sure that all of my scars and wounds from self harming come beacause she and I were having ""fights"". That would be devastating for her after all she has done to me, according to her point. She thinks she has done so many things and that I should be happy about having her as a parent. But I cannot. She pissed of my father so he never saw me and he committed suicide because of it. She has made so much debts thet I will inherit her debts, she has not been there for me regarding emotional things and has not been establishing a stable relationship towards me. And that is just a little selction. I mean she tries it especially concerning physical things. I can learn Instruments and i can go to a swimming club, I can go onto camps with the church etc. And everytime I say to her, that she was not there for me she points out the physical things. I have said to her that I have very strong suicidal thoughts and she did nothing. After I tried it she was shouting to me. She made me feel unloved. Because I have noone. I have friends, that I can go to, but what should they do? They are/were also kids. I would be such a big burden to them. And teachers you might say? I can not trust anybody because nobody ever helped me when I said that I needed help. The first time I was admitted to the hospital a teacher, which I had for over 8 years came to me since my notes and appearance and turn-ins dropped. She asked me and she saw, that I was not good. She came to me. She said that she sees that i am not alright. And as my first reflex was to tell her that I am ok, she said that I am not. And then she said I am not myself. I am not ok. And then I borke down. Finally, after over 12 Years someone noticed, that I am not alright. I was not ablle to play my role. I could not hide my depression anymore. I seemed to function on the surface, but she noticed the subtle signs. She came to me when i could not come to her and she had not slacked her efforts. My Mum on the other hand Ignored me for 3 montsh straight, did not talk to me, did not come into my room to ask how i am going. Nothing. She did not care. She does not care. The whole time I was in school I dreamt about my teachers being my parents. It was clear for met that they are different as parents and that they never could be, but it was my dream. I wished myself a stable person, which loved me emotionally and that would be older than me. That could take care of when I could not. I was jealous of the teachers kids. I was jealous of my friends. Because they had both parents. One has splitted parents, but he sees both of them regularly. Back to the topic: I am cutting myself because of stress with my mum and me feeling alone an being not worthy of love. (Btw her love was not unconditional, it was coupled to not say anything against her etc.) We had a dispute about my future as a voulnteer and she shouted to me. I went in my room and tried to calm myself. I tried to say that this was just a booboo and it would not happen again (that she will hate me). But I could not. I have fear about the future. And other things going around so I am clearly on the edge with my emotions. I cut myself deeply i had to get stitches. On wednesday we had another confrontation. I have not spoken to her since then. Everyday I cut myself. This night my ""cutting-session"" was 2 hours long. never have I ever cut so long and so much. I have cut my wrist, my thigh, my arm, my foot, my tummy. ""Normally"" i just cut my thigh and every now and then my arm. I think some wounds should get medical attention but I can not. I have no will to get out of bed. And then my mum has to be noticed. The one thing that bothers me the most is that she has never excused herself for anything. She never exscused herself for being late, for not keeping agreements, for lying to me, for anything. And I think she never will. Because she says I have to be grateful that she gifted me with the life and so on. (But I do not want to live....) Thanks that I can write it down here. At least I would be pleased when it would not get deleted, nobody has to read this. I just wanted it to be written down. But if you have read this, thanks for hearing me. This night is pretty hard.",0
"I have just finished school and my depression has never been worse. I would rather literally kill myself than working like a slave for the rest of my life. Maybe I am mentally retarded or something..Anyway, I was studying med school (not doctor), and there is a job I could potentially apply for but I do not know if I can do that. I have zero experience and I am always nervous in new environment.. Who the hell would like to work with someone like me. Also, my communicating skill is almost non-existent. Even if they would invite me for a job interview what the hell would I tell them?! I can put mask and act like a different person, but this is just too much..On the other hand, I am ready to kill myself in 48 days so. Do these anxious thoughts even matter?

"Hi, I am in a phase of depression that makes me really desperate. After years of neglecting my depression or thinking ""Cool now I am cured"", I am starting to realize that this shit is going to come back at me again and again and again if I do not change my life fundamentally. Which I did not want, because I was (unsuccessfully) hunting for money.I am waiting for therapy and was wondering if there are any books you can recommend that helped you understand your condition in a better way. I find it very hard to distinguish between my own thoughts and ""the depressions thoughts"" to a point where I can not trust my thoughts and feelings anymore and question basically anything I think, feel or do. Books for depressed people",0
"I have dealt with chronic depression from a very young age, I am currently 31yrs old. There have been times in the past where I though I was as bad as I could get. Felt that hopeless despair and apathy. Rock bottom.The depths to which my depression could truly sink was discovered two weeks ago. There was no catalyst for this change, everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression, that suicide was never an option, not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong. Thinking of family and loved ones no longer steers me clear of this option. This is truly a scary place to be, and I fear I am losing myself entirely. I do not know what I am looking for here, perhaps just a place to speak my peace. Much love reddit, stay strong. My chronic depression has recently transformed into something far worse than its ever been.",0

Which is a fat lie. I do not have the capacity to do that right now whatsoever. I have been completely isolated in my apartment now for close to 25 years and the word loneliness does not come close to describing the agony.

"Hello,Sometimes i feel like i am having moments of total clarity, where i perceive the world as clear and true as possible, physically but also mentally. It feels almost like you would feel during meditation. However, in these moments, all that i seem to find is emptiness and futility. it is almost like something i carry around with me all time subconciously. it is the realization that we as humans live our lifes based on beliefs and values that ironically have zero value. it is all constructed in our heads, and we clinge to these things almost in panic, to not fall into this pit of emptiness.I feel like i have this realization since my early teens and still have not found any satisfying answers to it. How am i supposed to live life in this society, realizing that almost all the values that define me as the person i am now, are basically meaningless, that i have been chasing illusions of a fulfillment that basically only means slavery? If i was born a nihilist i would just start living life recklessly and hedonistic. But i feel like i am far too sensitive to just throw away everything i believed in...I do not even know why i am typing this here, maybe because there is still this thing called hope in me. Hope that there is someone who can relate. kind of ironic that there is still hope within me , since hope is basically the one thing that makes us humans strive for things that are not real.

I finished college with fairly high grade though, all of my motivations were anxiety driven, or auto-pilot modeWhich i hated so much. that is a life of a ghost. I was so fed up with that mindset.

"So first off I am a piece of shit human being. I have never been in trouble or been in jail but I am not a good person. My family excommunicated me. I do not have any friends except one and he is unable to help me. I fucked off my twenties (33 now) did not apply myself dripped out of college at 26/27. Lived with my Dad till he passed in Jan 2019. He was my best friend/confidant would call him everyday if I was out of town for work. A week after he died I was fired. So I took my dog Suka, sold everything I could and went out on the road. Ended up in Oregon. While surrounded by natural beauty and people who genuinely wanted to know me I just could not as I was in another dimension emotionally. Asjed for help form my Godmother in Arkansas. That was a mistake. Was literally asked by her (a social worker btw) if I was a retarded.... So because I have fucked over my family so many times nobody believes that I want/working on to be better. Back on the road.Ended up in Tulsa. Worked at a call center. Call center helps me get a place. Pandemic happens. Stuck in apartment being yelled at by people on a constant basis. I quit my job. Lose apartment. Asked for help from a cousin. Cousin has a roommate with three other dogs. Said roommate is a veteran. During a family get together with cousin in law coming back from deployment, the dogs get in a fight. Veteran roommate tackles my dog (old Shepard Husky mix) and less than a month later I had to have him out down. So in the last two and half years I lost two of my best friends. I lost everything. I live out of my truck once again. I have reached out to people but it is been a no go from them. One of them is still thinking about it but it is most likely going to be a no. I keep being told that I am worthy of a happy life. But everytime I work towards that the rug is pulled. Or I do something very stupid like quit a job. I am not worthy. The talents I thought I had have dried up. The relationships I thought I had have dried up. My patience has dried up. I am just screaming in a void. I do not have anywhere to go. I have nothing and I feel like nothing. No spouse no kids no dog no life. What am I doing here? I will not call the hotline. I do not want to be incarcerated. Because I am already living in a self made prison. I just cannot do this anymore. I do not want to this anymore. There is no hope for me. Right now I am just trying to decide between the revolver or the shotgun at this point. But I will probably do another self sabotage before it all ends. cannot do this anymore",1

"Hi, I am not sure if this is the right forum where I should post and I do not really use reddit so bare with me.I am a 19 yr old guy who is currently studying finance in university. I basically get totally obsessed with a hobby, a girl, a subject, a class, a friend, anything, and then 1-3 months later, be totally bored. Some examples..1. First semester of university, totally obsessed and got 90s, second semester no motivation2. Met a girl and starting dating her, we talked nonstop and loved eachother, got bored and lost feelings after 5 months.3. Started reading books, would read entire books in just a few days, now I can barely pick one up. The only things that I can think of that I do not get bored of are stocks, cars, and business (my passions), but then again, it is always a different stock, different car, and different idea to make money.My father is similar but I think my case is more severe. I cannot see myself dating/marrying for longer than 2 years, being at a job for more than 2 years, etc. I would say my mind is definitely different compared to most people.

"I owed the IRS 100. from 2011 and they billed me for 900., I said go fuck yourself, but eventually when I had a return they just took it. I do not make much money, best year ever was 32,000. but normally 24,00 or a little better, and my return was about 50. most years which they took. I still owed a bunch when stimulus went out, but I never got a stimulus check for whatever reason so I was able to to put that in my tax filing and get it that way a year late but they took 1,200 of the 1,600. I needed a car, but now I am just stuck waiting for my 13 year old car to die (tranny is slipping, and the motor is sounding strange) so I can hitchhike the 13 miles to work. Good times. In total, that 100. cost me almost 2,000. after their penalties, ect. Got laid off 2 years ago causing me to default on 2 credit accounts, got sued and had a garnishment on 1 so far for a year that had me at times having to choose between food or gas to get to work. I bought gas, that was the best money year on paper because I begged for overtime to somewhat offset the garnishment so I did not become homeless or starve. Another garnishment is coming soon, I do not know if I can survive another one. I have never been so depressed before, have completely isolated myself from everyone , not sure I am going to make it to 58 years old. I am a simple guy living a very basic life. No tv, no extras, internet is my one extravagance. I have been continuously employed for the last 15 years with only small gaps before that. I am an 8th grade educated failure of an adult. that is my experience as a white man in America. (I am not suicidal despite the depression, I have a grown daughter and I could never because her that kind of pain, but there have been times that I thought an accidental death, or death by illness would be a blessing. I am tired of this life.) I have no solution to my life. is not it ironic that I cannot afford to file for bankruptcy? I gave notice and am changing jobs and upending my work of the last 9 years just to get 1 more dollar an hour because no raise this year even though I worked through the pandemic when 2/3 of the shop left. 2 of us kept a 7 man operation going for months before people started trickling back in. They made a lot more money on unemployment than I did working. I have only ever had 1 unemployment check in my life and I was working another job when it arrived. I am sorry this is so long, it feels good to get some of this off my chest, I do not have anyone I can tell this to, nobody else knows, I am too ashamed to speak of it to anyone.

"i hate the panic and loss of control i feel over myself when i starting realizing how alone i am. the sitting against the floor just wishing things could have been the slightest different. my mom kicked me out 4 months ago and i live my my dad on his couch right now. i moved to a different state during covid last year and hardly can talk to any of my old friends, my mom cut off my therapist so i cannot call her anymore and I am so tired of talking to my family about it because they just never understand the full extent of what my mom put me through and how bad my depression and anxiety is. they all want me to text her her and i have a panic attack anytime i even think about communicating with her. she sent my brother birthday gifts for me and I have been sitting on the bathroom floor for twenty minutes sobbing because I am so tired of her trying to be in my life still and i wish she would just please leave me alone. i hate when the wave comes back",0
"Suicide rap-All this pain and agony, every day is like its raining tragedies, my brain has had it you see, bc I am angry and mad at me, my view of this would is its lame and sad with savagery, I am tired of putting on a fake face and acting happy, so I am real with how I feel, so I am no longer wearing a mask, and now you do not want to chill and wrap with me, bc I am insane, crazy, and a psychopath you say to me,Well I say money is the root of all evil, so even though you need it to survive , you got to decide , not to be stupid people, For me its hard to be positive and optimistic, when there is nothing but negatives, and obvious impossible obstacles in my vision, so I am pessimistic, and suicide seem like the only solution that is logical, so should I slit this wrist, blow my brains out with this heat on my grill, or OD with these handfuls of pills? Either way my death still will be, me self killed bc of the guilt that made me hate me Another one..",1

"you are thinking, ""wow, she is shallow as hell."" Or my personal favorite,, "" you do not need men. Screw them."" Which is so predictable, but completely false and quantitatively unhelpful.I have wanted to die since I was 10. I am 30 now and the feelings have not gone away. They only keep getting worse.As a little girl growing up, I thought I could be happy even if I was not pretty. I wanted to know that the TV shows and movies did not lie to me, and that I would have boyfriends, and go to parties, and get fucked at prom. I wanted to know I would get married one day, and have babies. I just wanted to be normal. But I learned very early, very quickly that I would never have those experiences. I got told my ears and eyes were too big. I was told ""dresses are for pretty girls, you can wear shorts."" l got told no one would ever want to date me, but at least I was skinny. I got told I should probably just kill herself because unattractive people do not end up happy. I was not even 10 yet, just that little girl. Then that little girl started to grow up. And everything they said was true. No one wanted to date me. No one wanted to talk to me. No one wanted to fuck me. I was ignored. Completely invisible. I did not get asked to dances. I did not get asked to prom. I had to go to war with a teacher who tried to fail me for no other reason accept the one he finally admitted to, ""I just do not like the way you look."" I am just not pretty. I know that. People made that very clear. Since I was not pretty, I had to become smart. I had no choice. The only problem with that was I was smart enough to realize how miserable I was. How much pain I was in with nowhere to put it. She was smart enough to go to college. Where everyone gets porked and finds their partner right? Wrong. That girl was told at the only party she was allowed into that she was too ugly to be raped. That girl was excluded from going to parties after that. People invited that girls' roommates to go out and do things RIGHT IN FRONT of her and excluded her. That girl was fired for being too ugly to work at the school. That girl was told she should just become a nun since she was never going to be able to find anyone to fuck her. That girl finally made her first attempt when she was 19. Which she failed, miserably. She tried again at 20. Again, another failure.That girl, now a woman, understands why men do not want her. she is understood her whole life and has been forced to just accept it. She understands that she will be alone for the rest of her life. She could shorten that life of course. She could make the pain stop. Would it be worth it? Just to make the memories stop? To not have to endure the future of more pain? What the hell...why not? New here and after reading some of your stories, I thought I would take a stab at telling a little bit of mine. I will start with the easy stuff: I am not pretty, and that is why I want to kill myself.",1

No one has ever cared abt my birthday, or that I am even alive. I do not feel loved by anyone. I am all alone. I hate being me so much. I would rather die than continue living like this! I already self harm and stuff so what is the big deal, right? Who gives a shit anymore?! I never really mattered in the first place, I was born just so my dad could play house with my mother!

She use to give me orange tictacs and everytime I smell the smell of cigarettes I get reminded of her. the list goes on and on. Everything reminds me of her. I remember her sweet gentle voice, she loved me alot. She wanted to see me one last time before she passed away but my Dad would not let me.

I suffer from OCD and there are so many compulsions I feel like I need to engage in at the moment that I feel like I cannot even do them.

"I have lived my life trying to please others and any time I would try to be happy for me I would end up being an ass to others. I turned 18 a week or two ago but I started having thoughts of who am I? What actually makes me happy and not just numbs me to life? What am I to me and not what I want to appear as to others, because I have lived my life trying to please others anytime I agree to something because they make me feel needed but I hate it and if I quit I feel like an ass. Anyways that aside I have had thoughts about killing myself not because I feel depressed or something bad happened, I just do not know where to go. I feel so hollow, I feel like a mannequin masquerading as a human. Nothing feels like me, I can only enjoy things that make me happy for a short time and then after that nothing. I just go searching for the next thing to try and numb me. I do not think I could ever kill myself because I do not want to force my pain onto my friends and family but there is so many times I can imagine killing myself, I can imagine plunging a knife into the base of my neck under my adams apple, I can imagine when I go out shooting with my sisters husband taking the pistol and blowing my brains out. it is so vivid I can feel the gun in my hand and feel the grip in my hand kicking back as I pull the trigger, but it does not make me feel anything this is the first time I feel something thinking about it but it is because I feel overwhelmed by how ridiculous I sound. I just needed to get this out and maybe get some responses I think, I honestly do not know and as I finish typing this it feels as if something just clicked in my head and now I just feel annoyed at how much of a little pansy ass bitch i am.

"Two years ago I moved to the US for college. I am 19 now, and I am Arab. I knew moving abroad would come with challenges, but I cannot help but feel like so much of what I think, have to say, even feel in reaction to situations is different from everyone around me. I feel like my emotions are exaggerated, I express them too warmly (not in a good way) compared to other people. I feel like I am amazed and impressed by things others around me do not bat an eye on. I feel like so much of how I feel is extra, overly emotional, not fitting for the situation, like I am overflowing. Its really hard to describe. But its really alienating. I know I am not the first person to move abroad and feel alienated, but I just did not think it would happen in this way. I thought that was things like different cultural norms, language barrier, feeling homesick, etc. that made you feel alienated. But I am internalizing this so much. Feeling like I myself am abnormal. I do not know if this makes sense.... just posting this to see if anyone relates. Feeling like a literal alien...",0
"Please, do not take offence to anything I say in this post, but I feel like I need space to be honest about what I am feeling.I am not sure if I have depression, but every time I try to have hope in the future, it feels silly. Part of it is climate change anxiety. Part of it is just a lack of belief in myself. At the same time, it feels like I am being defeatist. Like I am giving up just because I am lazy and I do not want to expand the effort. Not because I am genuinely depressed.Does that make sense? A part of my brain would imagine what it is like to just disappear, to put it mildly, and another part of my brain would tell me that I am making it up. To myself? how would that even work?Me and my girlfriend had a fight, because I have trouble focusing and I forget things. And sometimes, I forget things so much that I piss people off. And they get angry at me, because I read a lot, I know a lot of little factoids, I have an ""important"" job, but I act like an absent minded child. So, I guess in their head, I do not deserve the social status they are projecting on me? Am I so arrogant that they expect me to be important?I feel guilty for what I have. Because I know there are a lot of people struggling, with the pandemic, and with all the social problems right now. I do not feel like I deserve it.She called me... the best translation I can think of is ""insane idiot"". It has far darker connotations, like someone who cannot take care of themselves, who is a social reject etc. etc. I have to once again repeat that I did genuinely pissed her off; she was in a rush with some errands, and I was slowing her down, and fucking things up, because my brain cannot work that fast.I told her, I told her all about how much that word hurts me. How it brings to mind other things, other people have told me. People who were close to me. People I looked up to and trusted. Thoughts I have every day, if not consciously, then subconsciously. I can barely remember what I did yesterday. But I can vividly remember every time someone called me worthless or an idiot.That made her feel guilty, and made her apologize for what she said. And I feel like I manipulated her. Like I fucked with her head to get my way, so that I do not have to change and better myself. I do not trust the way I think, I do not trust the way I look at things. Part of me thinks I should make up something to ""hope for"" in the future. Part of me thinks that is stupid and in-genuine. Part of me wants to stop being so pathetic and defeatist.I do not know what to think anymore.At least I still have my hobbies, which I am passionate about. For an hour or so every day, I can escape. I do not think I really have anything else. I am in a very weird space, I am not sure if this is depression",0

I walk down the street without looking hoping a car will just finish me and pray for an accidental death. Something that will not label me as a suicide but I am not so lucky. Nothing specifically happened, I am just tired of feeling like this. It feels like I have been drowning for the last 15+ years and am just now realizing that I drowned a long time ago. But I worry what will happen when I die. My sister has struggled with depression and suicidality for years and I have been her support. I worry that she will take her own life if I do. My mother has always been on the more delicate side and has admitted to me that she never fully recovered from my sisters past suicide attempts. I am not sure she will recover if I die. The list goes on. I have become an important support network for many and its left me with no one to talk to. Its like I am being held hostage by the people around me and I feel so stuck.

I picked up on that quiet early as I once cried as a kid around 7 ish years and got in trouble for doing that. Ever since I have never cried in front of my family. Sadly it caught on fast and I cannot cry even when I am extremely sad. I am often so depressed and just want to cry it all out and feel better afterwards, but I just cannot cry. And to add on top of that, I am in a long committed relationship and my girlfriend [F22] easily cry when she is upset or sad which makes it harder for her to understand me being sad or depressed as I do not express it by crying Anyone else not able to cry and how to get those feelings out??td;lr Depressed but can never cry.

"It has become nearly impossible for me to relate to the normal things that other people have and take for granted everyday. I do not feel human anymore because I cannot relate to or connect with anything that people say anymore. All I see is everyone elee living their lives while I have been stuck in the same position for years with no help. Whenever I see a couple togerher it really effects me because I have never had anything like that and I realized that other people do not care what you are goinf through, as long as they feel good they are content to ignore you. I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship in my life. People have always treated me differently. I watched as the years went by and everyone else in my family found a partner and got married. While other people found love I was here alone and I still am.This entire situation has had a terrible impact on my mental state. These days all I find myself doing is wasting the road at it my limited time and sleeping. When everyone else talks about their interests and hobbies all I can think of is oh that is nice, I wish I could afford to go out and do fun things. But since I do not have any money I can only have hobbies that are free such as writing and reading. It saddens me to no end how other people are held above us and used as a form of social capital. Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way, but for some reason we continue to, day after day, much to our own dismay. Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way, but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person, I do not feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while. It is great how everyone else gets to continue to live their lives and experience all these things that people take for granted, while my life declines and gets worse everyday. Every day just gets worse for me. Every day is more suffering",1

I know I am feeling extra shitty right now because I just took my medicine late but I really just want to escape.Nothing is appealing anymore except going to work because that means I get some social interaction even if it sucks. I want friends so bad but I have no idea how I am supposed to make them now without school. I just want to have a conversation with someone face to face who is not my family, therapist, or boss that is like ten years older than me. I am just so tired of being surrounded by only older people and no one my age.

Not that it is her job or anything like that. But without someone counting on me, I will be out of reasons to try at all. Honestly even having plenty of good reasons is not helping. I do not want to die; I am terrified of death. But constantly being pulled toward it and with no motivation or ability to live my life in a way that is not humiliating pathetic is fucking unbearable.

Why you get to run off and take a vacation I am going to cry myself to sleep every single day wondering what I could have done to fix things. Maybe I should not have given you that space right away, maybe I should have said sorry right away but I was doing what I thought was right. Now? I am just waiting to die. do not worry though, hopefully, I will stop being so scared and soon I will do it. What am I even scared of? who is going to take care of the animals? My Mom will give them to good homes, I am sure of it. I could just give it a week and let you be alone, let you ""think"", but I think we already know you have thought enough. that is why you are ghosting me, right? You do not want me. Nobody does, nobody can handle my bpd or my outbursts. Trust me, I cannot either. I am just waiting now for the free time, for the time when I can get away and do something. I cannot wait to be done with life. Maybe then you will cry about me, maybe then you will realize that I loved you and I tried so hard. I doubt it though, nobody cares about me after all. I am just counting down the days until I can finally dedicate myself fully to ending it. I should not be so scared. I will get over it. I guess I am going to go take even more sleeping pills now. Hopefully this time I will not wake up. Congrats! I am Dead Inside Because Of Us",1
"Its my birthday today. I am 29 now. I got up early, took a shower, and played some feel-good music. I did my nails, picked out an outfit, put on my makeup and even did my hair. All of this to try to make me feel something. I used all the tools I could to set the tone for today. But I just feel empty. I want to feel how everyone else around me feels, but I cannot. The fact that I cannot even feel good on my own birthday makes me feel like a failure. Logically, I know I am not. Logically, I know shit happens. Logically, I know there will be better days. But I do not get to choose when my brain believes logic or not. So today, I am hurting really bad. All I can think about, is wishing that I did not have to be here or feel this anymore. I will not act on those feelings, but it does not change the fact that they are stuck swimming in my head and hurting the hell out of me right now. I just need to get these words out somewhere safe. Where I do not hurt my loved ones for being honest about my pain. If anyone has any other ways or tips to help this hurt less, I would appreciate it. I am not going to, but God does this hurt.",0

"Today I helped family move some furniture from a neighbors house who is moving soon, and could not help but notice how the neighbor (M, mid 30s) was muscular. Welp guess who cannot stop feeling sorry for himself? Yup, its me. I know I am so lucky to have as fast of a metabolism that I do but it makes me so depressed being 22 years old, 510, and weighing only 120 pounds. Everytime I hit or bump into something, it just pretty much hits bone because I have very little muscle or fat to protect myself. I am starting to eat better slowly but still find myself not eating enough. I am just so lazy when it comes to cooking for myself.

"I do not want to offend anyone, so please know I am just asking for advice/wisdom/experience, not trying to be hurtful. Do you know when you are not yourself? My husband thinks everything is fine, but he is so grumpy with all of us (3 kids), short tempered and not fun to be around (usually is amazing to be around). I say that I am codependent because I Always want to be around him, but I prefer doing things without him now because of how he treats me and how little things make him explode. This is how he is when his depression is not managed, but he does not seem to know there is a difference. He thinks he is just himself, but I know and the whole family has to walk on eggshells around him. I have suggested getting back to the gym (that + meds does the trick and for 2 or 3 years, I got HIM...when he was doing that.). He will not go to the gym (or lift on our weight bench at home) and insists that he does not need to and he is fine. I cannot do this again (dealt with him in depression for 10 years. Ten hard years where he could not love me bc he did not love himself. I stuck with him, but finally put my foot down that he needed help, which is why he finally started meds) and am starting to feel depressed myself (sad, crying, do not want to get out of bed) just thinking that this is happening again. it is been going on a few months. Very bad for 2 weeks. we have been married for 18 years. I have talked to him and he just gets mad and says he does not need to work out and that I am the problem and he is normal. Thank you for any help. From a wife:",0
"I have a friend who lives in Florida. Her mom was recently diagnosed with a condition that has left her unable to work. Now their only source of income is from disability, but it is not enough to cover their rent. My friends dad was originally covering the rent for them but is no longer doing so. Now my friend tells me that her mom is thinking about moving in with another family member since its either that or homelessness. The problem is that said family member has a history of sexual abuse towards my friend when she was younger. Friend tells me she will kill herself if they end up moving there.She has attempted several times in the past and I am worried for her safety. She needs professional intervention because she is a threat to herself and I need resources for voluntary/involuntary hospitalization. I am resorting to reddit now because the local crisis hotline is totally useless. I called them and waited on hold for over an hour. Then I ended up falling asleep. When I woke up I was shocked because to my disbelief, I was still on hold with them 6 hours later into the call. I need advice on how I can help my friend",1
"I am staying in my parents' house for the summer, since I have just graduated college. I have an industrial engineering degree. I am supposed to start work at what I am told is a very good job in September. It was a very competitive position and, to my everlasting shame, I outcompeted a great number of people far more dedicated and motivated than myself simply because they did not possess the same talent for education and testing. I ought to have pursued something more mediocre to begin with, or maybe nothing at all, given that I will be a rotting corpse by September either way. What a waste.I have moved my dad's Glock 19 from his dresser into mine, and I doubt that he will notice its missing before the gunshot. Right now the sole object of my life consists in building up the courage to point it towards my head. Once I am able to do that, I assume the act of pulling the trigger will be relatively easy. To my mind, overcoming the subconscious instinct of survival by an act of conscious will might be the single most significant act of individuality it is possible for a person to undertake. that is probably not true, but I believe it anyway, since it provides an air of dignity to what is fundamentally a cowardly and disgusting action. And if I am doing it either way, what difference does it make whether I dignify it or torture myself by calling it what it is? I have grown tired of torturing myself. Although the recognition of this logical inconsistency is really self torture in its own right.I am sure my suicide will seem absolutely ridiculous to everyone I know. My life appears to be going perfectly. I just visited a good friend of mine in another state for a week, and in that entire time did not tell him anything of these feelings. I have not told my family either, or any of my other friends. I just cannot stand the thought of them actually trying to help me, actually trying to ""be there"" for me and comfort me. The thought of their empathy makes me sick to my stomach. They really have nothing to offer me, and if they did try to help me I would have to pretend that they actually were, to avoid hurting them more. The last time someone gave me the old, useless platitudes of ""things will get better"" and ""people love you"" I wanted to laugh in his face, but instead I pretended that those words had helped me, for his sake. That moment was nothing but a reminder of how wide the gap is between me and every other living person, how alone I really am.Alone. that is the root of all this. I could stomach all my uncertainty, my nihilism, my cynicism, the tangled, unnatural, unworkable psychological web I am trapped in, if there were a single living human being who could understand it. Could understand me. With whom I could share some common ground, even one idea or way of thinking. But there is not. I think I am probably insane. Some undiagnosed mental illness runs in my family, and drove my grandfather and great grandfather to paranoia, delusion, reclusively and violence later in their lives. Your response to my concern here will be to tell me to see a psychiatrist or therapist, since that suggestion is in vogue on this website right now. Well, I have seen them. Two different therapists. I even tried to be honest with them. And the response, the ideas and suggestions they gave me were so asinine, so off base, so completely missing the point that I almost could not believe it. I felt insulted. I doubt there is any help for me in the field of mental health, any more than there was for cancer patients in the days of Hippocrates.I do not know why the hell I wrote any of this. it is either a cry for help or an attempt to put something of myself into words for others to see before I cease to exist. ""non omnis moriar"". Either way, I have nothing else to say. On My Approaching Death",1

"Been depressed and suicidal since 13. Seven years of unhappiness and nothing ever makes me feel normal. Nothing and no one inspired or helped. I tried professional help, meds, and reaching out before. I do not even remember being happy when I was a child, but I remember my first attempt was at 13. Finally have the means to do it without failure and I could care less about the pain at this point. My shyness and lack of personality has left me so lonely. I have never felt as hollow and empty as I do now. It feels like there is nothing left for people to take. I am the people pleaser type because Ill be filled with too much anxiety otherwise, so now I am just exhausted to the point of giving up. cannot fix someone who is held down by themselves. there is no reason for me to be this way, I just have never had a life and never will. I have never felt truly happy, or at least okay. I tried to just go through it for a very long time, I hope you all will continue trying. I hope it really does get better for every single one of you.

"I really do not know how to describe it in intelligent ways, but it affects everything I do. It feels like as I have gotten lonelier and lonelier, there is a blanket filter applied to everything I do that takes away it is meaning, and it makes it feel cold and isolating? it is this feeling, especially when I am out in public, or driving around, or at work, that I am just completely out of place, I do not belong here, and that no one around me is a person I can connect with or trust. I feel this feeling constantly, and I want nothing but for it to go away. &amp;#x200B;it is completely draining, it makes me think in stupid ways, and it makes everything in life feel emotionless, or unreal. Sometimes it makes me feel like a passenger in a life I cannot control. I really wish I could describe it better, but I am sure some of you have felt this feeling as well. it is also totally exaggerated by architecture, I feel it the strongest during my commute through the beaten up concrete hell I live around, and the feeling is completely absent whenever I find myself in a place that just... looks cozy, a place with lots of nature and life?

"I am just going to leave this here because it will be too long a read for most, but to those that do read it thank you for listening.My family has always had a difficult time in life, my father died when I was young, leaving my mother a widow with two young children. She worked two labour jobs to keep us fed and pay bills, as we got older we helped as much as could financially. Ill skip every detail, but a few years ago my sibling had made some poor decisions and it literally bankrupted my family. We lost everything, we were living in motels/hotels, I have even slept on floors of my friends, I have starved on occasions and its been tolling on my family. As a disclaimer we are a family of three, we do not have family or relatives to help us out, we had no friends because nasty rumours had circulated about my family. In no way do I blame them for making the mistake, I accept my situation, but recently its been too much for everyone.Then it happened the strongest woman I had ever known broke down, I have seen her cry on occasion due to my sibling and I arguing and it makes my mother feel like a failure on top of all that is going on, but today was like no other. I had always been depressed and when the times got too hard for us, I am so ashamed of myself, but I actually suggested that we take our own lives. I know its shocking and unfathomable, but we were all we had and I could not see the pain and suffering any longer. They said no obviously, but today my mom said she was ready to go because she does not have the will and spirit to keep fighting. To what she said we obviously denied her and told her it would be ok, but it took a lot out of me to hear where she is mentally. Were not suicidal, just tired of the situation because if you can imagine the worst case scenario, this is what it is. We have barely any money, no credit, no car, and currently in a bad housing situation that could end with us being evicted at any moment (home of my mothers half brother and his toxic wife). The backstory to that is that he had a heart attack and no one to care for him, we were asked to look after him, his wife wanted him dead so were at odds over that. Our current financial situation does not allow us to move, no credit to top it off. We pay for food for the whole household, another 4 people on the weekend, gas for the car you name it. Oh how I wish I could tell the whole story, its incredibly sad. The saddest thing happened today",0
"Around 2017 I found myself in a really shitty situation. My friends turned out to be the worst people on the fucking planet as they had made me chase them so far for their real friendship that I was at a point that I had no one else left. I did not feel like I could ask my family for help at that point, but when I finally came to and dropped those bottom feeding shit lords, I had run out of crossroads and was frustrated. I threw myself into games, Overwatch, Minecraft, Call of Duty, it did not matter to me. I stayed in that same situation until the pandemic. I do not mean it got better, it got fucking worse as I could not go outside at all, and as a direct result of that, it became quite literally all I did. At this point, I got some records in Overwatch and a few other games which had validated in my mind that this was what I was built to do. I then met someone who I thought actually might not be a toxic cunt, but as of now I am having doubts because I think my damaged social skills and autism kind of made her turn her back to me. I do not even know at this point, but I do not want to get more stuck in than I already am, do not have anyone else I can talk to or go outside with, but I also do not want to become a lifeless living thing. I am having darker thoughts as of yet which have always lingered but have been amplified because of her sort of avoiding me. I threw myself into games and cannot get back out",1
"I think that everything with my wife is okay but really I am just in a bad dream and to get out of it I have to kill myself.

So I am ending myself today.Goodbye to this nightmare, its time to wake up. I think I am in a bad dream and have to die to wake up from it.",1
"I have been regularly cutting back drinking by large increments because I was seriously worried it might kill me if I went good turkey.One if my family members told me that I was more fun and better off drunk. Sober, I get serious and focused. I have a drive to accomplish. I am not much a socialite. When I start drinking I loosen up and become really friendly and outgoing. I absolutely become the life off the party. But I started noticing I was drinking more and more, and eventually I was getting the shakes when I was sober. Shakes, headaches, dark circles under my eyes, irritable, and I had NO coordination sober, I could not motivate myself out of bed unless I knew I could get a drink in my hands immediately because I felt just so God damn awful.Decided to cut back, and cut back, and cut back. Been doing really well. I do not actually remember the last time I had drink, I think it is been about a week now? I do not keep track I just beat myself up Everytime I break and then get right back on the wagon determined to do better.Hearing my family say I was more fun and easier to get along with though when I was drunk cut me deep, real deep. I have since decided I do not need or want them in my life, but hearing another human being say I should resume slowly killing myself because I was more entertaining and easier going. Drinking was killing me",0
"I finally bit the bullet and saw a therapist virtually today for my crippling depression. I have a lot going on. Chronic illness heading toward complete inability to walk, I feel physically terrible 24/7, unhelpful family, social isolation, child with health issues and disabilities who I will be caring for her entire life, money problems, etc. I just want some coping mechanisms, some way to find moments of happiness sometimes. Some hope. I talked to her for an hour and at the end she said, ""You definitely have depression. I would talk to your doctor about trying a different antidepressant. We can try a couple more therapy appointments but you have got a lot to deal with and I do not know how much I can do for you.""Is it truly hopeless? My life is just terrible and will remain terrible forever? I feel so much worse than before! If a professional looks at my life and sees no hope, what could the person living it possibly do?! My therapist basically told me my life sucks too much for her to help me",0

It really does. we have never slept together. we have had separate bedrooms for the past four years. he is a jehovahs witness and I am not.I love him dearly but I am beginning to resent him.My friends - who know the full, complicated story - all tell me to leave, to get a place on my own, to start fresh.How can I do that when I am unemployable? When I have no savings? When I have barely any income of my own because I have become dependant on my husband?These are all rhetorical questions because they have been asked twice before. I stayed, and look where I am. Again.The number of times I have wanted to end my life is countless. I have never attempted, because I know when I do, it will be successful. I will have no 'attempt'. I have always been talked out. Or just not told anyone.Or done this- write long, stupid posts on Internet sites and by the end I just feel so sick of myself and my conceited whining that I end up engaging in self harm instead - pain instead of oblivion. I deserved that.But there is got to come a point where I reach these crossroads, see their familiar options, and just think.. I /cannot/ go down that road again. It does not work.. I cannot make it work.I realised today that my husband never asks me how I am, or if I am okay. It took a dream of someone who cared about me in the past to make me realise this.But all those people are gone.I am so lonely. So low.I do not want to hurt anyone and I know that I will. I just hope that they will be able to find it in their hearts to realise that I have spent my lifetime hurting.. And I cannot bear to do it any more. Come to this crossroads so many, many times..",1
"Was that too fucking much to ask for? Already 2 years of college ruined going on a third, because of DeltaIf I cannot have any of the remotely good in life, why the FUCK am I obligated to go through the bad, aka the rest of life as a miserable wage slave working some shitty ass 9-5 with serf pay?

"By all rights, I should be an adult, I am 23 ffs. But I am Bipolar, anxious, and terrified of the family I am dependent on. Lying is my defense mechanism, my way to ensure that even though the future will probably suck, I can at least sleep for another night. Ironically, when I tell them the truth, I am told I am a liar, an attention whore; I am the paradoxical pathological liar. One of my major lies, something nobody else really had any business knowing, is on the cusp of being found out. In all likelihood, this will be the final straw, and I will be cut off. I cannot say I would blame them, nobody wants a family member who constantly has problems. I suppose the best way is to just accept it, and take whatever happens next. Between a rock and a hard place, the only option is to be crushed.",0
"I am not going to die from suicide. do not fucking come after me. I just fucking need. something I feel completely rejected and shut out from the world. I am gay, I am transgender, I am fat, I am insane, I am autistic, I am learning disabled. I honestly think, I honestly know most of the world wants me dead because of these things because people consistently and repeatedly show me that is true. I mean fuck, they openly fucking post it on this very website.I have agoraphobia. I dropped out of school before I even made it to high school (so I will never have an okay job, I will always suffer) because the bullying was so severe I knew I would die if I stayed in school. In 2019 I used literally every single drop of power I had to get put on anti anxiety medication. I was able to leave the house for the first time in years and get a job to save for getting my tits chopped off. But my boss was hateful and abusive so I had to quit or I would have killed myself. So I got another better job, I even got a promotion, but my bosses AND the customers were hateful and abusive, so again I had to quit or I would have killed myself. A double mastectomy by my calculations is roughly $10,000. I never even managed to save $5,000, and by now my savings are long gone.I decided in 2020 I would start attending the queer center in my city because I was so fucking alone. I was really optimistic about trying this. Then covid hit. Then I aged out of my parent's insurance and loss access to my meds. Now I am agorapbobic again. I am too afraid to leave my home to get the vaccine, I tried, which means I literally have to stay home. Except for my amazing partner, I am so fucking alone.I got caught writing a suicide note at 13 and was imprisoned against my will in a mental hospital and now I have ptsd from it. its been 13 years since that and I still struggle to shower and wake up in terror from the active, gleeful abuse by the staff. I cannot even fucking get help because its not even fucking safe. I will never, EVER trust a mental health professional again. I cannot get help.I do not know what I can possibly fucking do. I do not know how I can possibly fucking live a happy life with my partner. I cannot transition, I cannot move out of home, I cannot keep a job, I cannot keep a friend, I cannot accomplish my goals. what can I even fucking do. how can I fucking live in this world. what can I fucking do. its so fucking hopeless. how can I ever be happy with my partner. I do not fucking belong in this world, I do not understand how or why I am here. I am not even human, why am I here. title",1
"I have always struggled with my mental health. I have severe severe anxiety and paranoia, probably sprung from a decade of drug and alcohol abuse in my 20s. I was doing so well since I knocked the drugs on the head at 29. But my paranoia has never disappeared. I am in a relationship with an incredible woman, but I have started slipping back into drug abuse again, and I feel like I am being gaslighted and I am unsure how to separate reality from fiction. That makes my innate paranoia a thousand times worse. I have no real way of coping with my paranoia soI dive back into smashing the booze and the booze almost always always leads to drugs which has lead me to being suicidal again. Its just easier not to have to think. I feel like a complete and utter burden to every single person I have in my life, I am fucking rubbish, no one should have to deal with my issues because I cannot keep my shit together. I feel like I have no worth, like I cannot get anything right in the world at all, I am a constant train wreck I simply cannot function with my thoughts. I have reached out desperately for help yesterday and today and have been met with little to no support or understanding from my family and friends. The crux does seem to be the gaslighting. It is really, really, really killing me and I need to know how to just drop the thoughts that things do not add up and simply trust her. I have been told by the family I have reached out to that I am selfish for seriously considering fucking hanging myself but how is it selfish to not want to live in constant, unending mental anguish and torment. I do not know what to do. I do not know what I need to feel better. I do not know how I can cope with all the thoughts swirling around in my mind or even remotely where to start. Its going to be much simpler to kill myself because I absolutely cannot deal with this shit. I am an awful fucking human being and the world would be better off without me. I cannot keep on rallying. It gets harder and harder the olde I get. Yesterday was my 33rd birthday and I have not wanted to kill myself as much as I did yesterday morning and today.",1
"Most subs do not understand this whenever i say this, but i just cannot take it anymore. These two people I run into in one of my favorite games and modes within said game, and it is just the worst experience ever whenever I play against them. They spam laugh, they taunt, they talk shit to us in chat, and they win every single game, every single time, and I just want to slit my wrists every time. I put so much time and effort in taking the little oppurtunities i have for fun to the highest degree, but the game just gets ruined every time. I then start connecting it to my own worth and i want to just end it all, I have cut because of it in the past. These people will never understand, never stop, never get consequences, and i want to die. Running into the same people in a game and it makes me want to waste away and die.",0

"I have been depressed for so fucking long but as of right now I kind of just do not feel anything. Like I really do not give a shit what happens to anything or anyone. I do not want to die but I do not want to live. I am always sick for some reason and I am always tired, its like my body has just given up. I like the idea of hanging myself in the woods and waiting for someone to stumble across my body. I cannot do that tho. I live a boring life as well, I do not find anything interesting anymore. I do not know what happened to me. I want to just stop existing",0

"I am very embarrassed posting this, since it includes topics relating my sexuality, but i feel like i need someone to listen I am going to write my post inside: "" [()]""Because what I will write is literally a bunch of things i wrote to someone i was chatting with, and since all I wrote to them is pretty much all I am complaining about here, I will do it this way[( I am a 19yo, gay guy, I will actually turn 20 next week, and for a really long time, I have felt really unattractive.My mom says I am actually good looking, and that i only need to loose weight, honestly, this does give me a little hope, but i still have some problems even with that way of thinking. My mom says I am not ugly, but no one at school has ever felt attracted to me, I never came out at school, and I do not even know if there are other gay guys there, so it is no wonder no guy ever liked me; but i really think there is got to be a reason for no girls ever liking me, not even a single girl was interested in me in all those years, i studied in that school for 15 years, i had been classmates with the same people for 8 years, and no one showed any interest, that honestly makes me sad...and makes me doubt my mom's words)]*Side note, i posted some pics in other subs and this person saw them, they are in my profile, keep in mind it is NSFW, so if you dislike it, do not see please, continuing...*[(I think it is really obvious that I am very insecure about the size of my penis, if i had to explain it properly,( well you already saw it) i dislike it is size, and it is color, I am fine with the shape, I am fine with the glands, I am fine with the curve, I am fine with the foreskin, but I am unhappy about the size and the color, i wish it was bigger, like 6 to 7 inches, and that the color was more resembling pink.I know it is no use worrying about those two things, i know it is something out of my control, but you have no idea how much it frustrates me, i feel so ugly, so unattractive, and unlikeable.The only hope i have left is working out and loosing all this extra weight, but even if i did, 5.5 inches long, and 4.7 inches thick is all i can truly be, 5.5 is my bone pressed length, and even tho people say it is averages, honestly it is not enough; i was fine with not being as tall as i wanted, i was fine with not being as smart as i thought i was, i was fine with not being so lucky with love, i was fine with not having a boyfriend before, i was fine with so many things, i was willing to accept so many bad things i have, because, after all, no one is perfect, we all pretty much HAVE to have something not so beautiful, but why do I have to be so poorly endowed, it is so frustrating! If I am unhappy with my weight, i can change it, if I am unhappy with my height, well, I am 174cm, and even though that is not very tall, it is not very short either, not only that, but it kind of helps me feel somewhat cute...well it would help me feel cute, if i did not already feel so ugly.You know, I am not even into being some sort of playboy, and I am not into having one night stands, or fooling around having casual sex, sex has a deep meaning for me, i just want to find my true love, i just want to find someone special who loves me and who i love, I am so willing to work hard to earn someone is love, to be special to someone, but honestly, i do not feel handsome enough to be with someone, i would like to feel handsome, and sexy and beautiful for him, but when i see myself, i do not see someone attractive, handsome, sexy nor beautiful, and it depresses me so much just thinking about making someone settle for less, settle for me, i wish I could be good enough, so that being with me does not feel like he is doing me a favor, i want to be someone my loved one not only loves, but also truly desires to be with, i do not want to feel like love blinds him in order to be with me.)]*that is the end of the message i wrote to the other person*I was chatting with other people, but things did not end up very well, i ended up feeling really sad, despite their kinds words,.so I am writing here, hopefully people here do not struggle with their sexuality, that is something i would not wish to anyone, but maybe i could be understood, since other people did not understand...

My family is too conservative for me to ever even think about coming out (they would probably disown me), only some of my closest friends know this (almost all girls). I cannot count on anyone to support meI think constantly about just getting the chance to get the money and go into hrt already, probably move in with some friends just to be able to afford to get as far away as I can from family (not because I dislike them in any way, they just would never approve of my transition) but honestly each day the option of just quitting life for good seems more temptingMaybe I just have not done it because I am scared of what comes after, because I do not want to break the hearts of those who will be left behind (although sometimes I think it would be easier on my family than me trooning out)My dad and stepmom will get me a little sister this year and I am so excited to see her grow up and to be there for her, yet I do not know if I could keep living a single week of this tortureI know my family has a history of suicides, most notably my paternal grandmother just months before I was born. I do not want dad to feel the pain of losing someone so dear like this again. He says he could only carry on after his mother's death because he was about to have a kid, that I am the only reason he is still here. I could not bring myself to break the heart of someone I love so much this way, but I just genuinely cannot bear this pain and I know he would hate any path in life that I genuinely wantI just wish so, so hard that I was born cisI've tried to repress, I have tried to pray it away, I have tried to ""man up"", but nothing fucking works. I get so furious at myself because I just cannot help it. I cannot help feeling so out of place among my male peers. I cannot help acting so effeminately that I needed to be constantly corrected all my life to ""act like a boy"". I cannot help wanting so much to look and be like a normal girl my age, instead of being a mentally ill borderline insane disgusting good for nothing maleI whine so much for someone in such a privileged position as a (lower but still) middle class white teenager. I cannot even enjoy this because of my mental delusionI just wish with all my might that another person could take my place and I could stop existing. Would be so much easier on everyoneDad, mom, I am so sorry I could not be the son you wantedI cannot even stand my own self pity anymore, but I cannot even decide if it is really worth it to keep on livingDoes it really get better?

It makes me feel a bit better for a short time and then I find myself in this thought that its all fake. I am not really happy if everyday I have to convince myself of it. I am just fake smiling, pretending everything is okay because from the outside my life does look pretty good. So why do not I feel that? Is that how the next 30 years of my life will be? Saying to myself every morning, smile, life is good. When do I start believing myself? I tried throwing myself into old hobbies, seeing friends, mindfulness etc. Yet the joy is only temporary. I understand we have to have bad days to appreciate the good but the balance is far off. I cannot work out what truly makes me happy. How do I want to spend the rest of my life?

I vent on social media and I have a blog with lots of followers.But I hate that I cannot talk about happy things, whenever I am excited about something I will not tell anyone because they would ruin it or give me thousand advices that I do not need or did not ask for. I get excited for each and every interview I get, but I learned the lesson to not tell anyone about it because they ruin it.

I also have moderately severe depression and anxiety which massively fluctuates - I can be totally fine for a few months or a year, then semi-functional or dysfunctional for a few days, weeks or months. I am hoping for advice from other people with similar issues - how do you plan ahead knowing that you have a really variable work output and how to you change your scheduling when you are going through a worse, but still able to produce something, patch. I am reasonably open about my issues with the people I work with and with my manager, but there still a certain level of inflexibility, with external schedules that we all need to work to.

"Today I went to a restaurant with my family while on vacation, and it was one I had not been to since my ex and I went when we were together over 3 years ago. I cried in the restaurant and could not stop. After he dumped me with no warning, I spent 6 months crying every single day and was suicidal. I had to go to therapy but I only had 2 sessions because I could not afford it. But I am mostly better with that, although I still have my days. I will return to therapy once I get a full time job again and can hopefully afford it.So yeah -- I just started crying in the restaurant because it overwhelmed me with memories (same restaurant but different location). Guess I am still not over him. I have not tried to date since, I am not even interested in meeting anyone. I always had mild depression but I feel that break up was so traumatic that it broke something inside of me. I felt a piece of myself die. Has a traumatic event made you feel like that? Did your depression get worse? Idk the point in this or what I am asking for -- I just needed somewhere to write this and get it off my mind. Thank you everyone.

It gives me mountains of anxiety thinking of them with someone else, and I cannot stop thinking about it. I am convinced they like someone else and I just want to die. I am so jealous and so scared that they are going to leave me and stop being my friend and I am going to lose them forever. I do not see any point of living anymore.

I try hard, but I just never remember to brush them. I am finally at once a day, twice a day seems far off. I KNOW I ruined them. I know its because of my mental health.Sometimes I eat sweets, and wince. Someone asks what is wrong, and I admit its my teeth. Que the half hour lecture about how silly I am for not going to the dentist, how did I let it get this bad, once my FIL called it trashy.I am already insecure because of how they look, and even more so because of why they got so bad. When people bitch about my teeth, I feel so stupid and weak.

I have never lacked anything, I have not gone through any traumatic situation or I have depression or anything, I have no reason why I could explain to someone why I want to die.

They steal, lie, exploit others and somehow they get rewarded and live happy while I have to bust my ass for a living while suffering? You are a fucking big joke and I do not understand why people still look up to you. Your not an almighty being, your just a sick fuck who stands by watching and does NOTHING to help like EVERYONE else. Fuck the Universe or God",0
"Warning: this is going to be long asf idek It seems like I am always getting left behind. I am going into senior year and I am thinking of doing Computer science for uni but there are two problems. 1. My admission grade is off by 2% from the required grade. 2. Idek if that is what I want to do. School for me has just been a game, collect as many good grades as you can, and for a while I was rlly good at it, pretending to be passionate about science since that is said to make me more money than something like art. Since this pandemic happened my grades slipped a little. do not get me wrong, they are still good, going from 90s to 80s but not good enough apparently to get into university. I just do not like how the competition has increased. I mean, back in the day you did not need much to get in. I am stuck at a place where I cannot imagine myself doing the career ideas I have for 50 years. I know I am not the smartest, and I accept that. But its one thing to be ugly and have no close friends and its another thing to not even get into the university program you want. All my classmates seem to have it together. Its not like they are perfect either but they are over here getting jobs and learning how to drive and I lack the motivation to do anything. Rn I am doing online summer school and I am still managing to fuck that up. I did terrible on my unit exam. I know all of you all are just going to tell me to get up and work hard but honestly, I am tired of being an overachiever and not getting my results. Idek why I am posting this. Idk if I am overthinking but I just feel worthless rn. Idk even know how I feel",0

Why do I always feel so lonely to the point of wanting to be gone? Guess I can be lost for a couple of months without anyone looking for me. L O N E,0
I am really struggling today. I live alone I am old 37 F and have no kids no husband no family I am really close with. .. I have few friends and I feel like I have no reason to live. The place I live is a resort destination so people come here to celebrate holidays with their family. Its incredibly painful for me. It makes me feel worse than I would otherwise. The 4th of July in America is a big holiday for many. At one time it was for me too. Now I am just lonely and overweight and have no job or prospects of a relationship. I have no one to take care of me when I am old. I have no money saved. No credit. I have huge student loan debt. My life is too worthless to maintain. The bad is outweighing the good. I cannot pull myself out as easily this time it feels pointless. I suffer with PTSD and have flashbacks and nightmares. I wake up in the morning having suffered through a whole night of torture and it makes me days worse. I think back on the dreams throughout the day. I cannot work. I cannot be around people. I can barely leave my house for any reason. My dog is depressed. I feel worse because of that too. Its just piles of awful. When I was younger I was more resilient. I could see hope in my future. I could go through the bad and still have hope. I cannot do it anymore. I lost the love of my life because of the way I am in 2014 and I think about him still daily. He is married and had at least one kid. I know where they spend these holidays together with his family happy. I wish that was my life. I miss him terribly even still. I hate my life. I hate my life. I just want all this to end. I just want to feel numb or nothing . These holidays make me want to not be alive anymore.,0

"My father does not give a shit about my struggles. He just compares mine to his. About how he did not have a bed, no closet, no computers not even a ball to play with blah blah blah. Then he goes and says all you have to fucking worry about isthe meaning of life. that is your biggest problem I am so fucking speechless. Hes only telling that because one time, when I was young, I asked him what is the meaning of life out of curiousity. Guess he could not answer that question, so he shamed me for asking. Last night he told me that yes you have struggles and you should just own it. Own your self harm scars. FUCKING hypocrite. You never gave a fuck, did you? All of those things you said were bullshit to make you look like a good parent. Guess what? You fucking signed up for this. You signed up for a mentally ill kid. You signed up for any fucking problems. Because you fucking wanted a kid. You took the gamble and now you got one. Happy? You are not the fucking victim. This fucking hurt me. Your own father saying that. You were the one selfish enough to have a kid in the middle of a fucking war. You saw all the fucking misery and the world and decided to put me through it.

I am not going to live on for 5 minutes of happiness every few months. i cannot do this anymore. nobody cares to see my tears nobody cares to see my pain so why should i care. it would be so easy to just end it all and never come back. i would do it right now but i cannot mess up this trip. my final selfish act. i really really need help please",1

"I do not want to be happy, I do not want to die, because I wish I was never born in the first place.My parents, two ignorant people, good people, but ignorant to the fact that existing is pain. I think I am pain because"" I think too much"", but thinking too much in this case means realizing the shit I am living in, just realizing I am alive. that is not too much, that just proves my point that living and worst yet, being able to understand that you are living and all this sensation of being alive and existing, it is like multiplying a pain that was already unbearable. I thought of slashing my flesh again until all that liquid that holds me alive (absurd if you ask me, a fucking liquid, a red liquid, and that is the reason I am suffering, because this fucking liquid is pouring into my mind which is an organ with a ridiculous form and colour and details, just a mass of shit) is out of this fucking flesh, this fucking frail flesh, I cannot stand it anymore. I have been taking lexapro for a month and a half now, and this shit does not work. This fucking shit does not fucking work but the doctor insists I continue taking it.

"I have not told any family or about this, they have enough to deal with as it is and I do not want to be selfish by bringing my problems to them. I have a couple of friends but I think they would be able to get over it. I worry most for my brother, I am the only person he talks to and if I am gone then I cannot be there for him. Plus, they may think I am crazy and send my to a psychiatrist and I do not want to do that. If I could stop my existence without hurting anyone I love, I would in the blink of an eye. At the same time it is really selfish of me to want this, after all life is not about me, it is about helping my family and others. I want to become a doctor when I am older but my mind keeps chanting the mantra that I am not going to make it to adulthood, and I kind of want that to be true. it is not that I hate my life, it is that I hate myself. Please do not ask me to talk to a psychiatrist or my family about it, I am not going to, I will hide my whatever this is from them for as long as I have to, and do not give me any of that ""It will get better"" nonsense because it will not, you and I both know it is a lie. I just want ways to figure out what to do with myself and whether it is worth hurting my family to end my own suffering. I want to just stop existing, or disassociate with humanity?

"there is been a steady decline in my concern towards other people for several months and it is still getting worse. Before all this, I cared about everything and everyone. I guess it was too much. Now all I want is to be alone. To not see anyone. But unfortunately I can never have a few days to myself. it is simply not an option right now. And the more I have to interact with people the more frustrated I get and the less I care. Anyone know what this is? I care less and less every day",0
"I went to residential for 2 weeks and it was amazingly helpful. It did so much to change my outlook on things. While I was gone, my wife realized she can not keep doing this. I spent all of my momentum coming out of residential on convincing her to at least give us a chance. I was able to get a job, only one place even reached out after I applied. It is physically wrecking my body. I am in pain every day. The pay is crap. Plus I am sleeping in the guest room which has a shitty mattress. I do not know if I can make it through this. I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass, unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our, sorry *her* room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table, that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it, I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work. I can not even work up enough to care. Falling Again",0
I am scheduled for my first session of therapy but I honestly do not see the point. they are going to drug me up and trick my brain into thinking I am happy. I cannot see that possibly happening. Every day that goes by I feel like I become worse. I am tired of people feeling sorry for me and I am tired of my depression ruin the friendships I have. I just want to disappear. I tried tricking myself into doing happy things like going on a date and at the end I felt worse than before. It seems my life is a one way path to dying alone and all my friends getting sick of my existence. I do not even have the motivation to cry any more. there is a wave of anxiety and sadness constantly drowning me and I just feel dead inside. I do not see how anyone or anything can help me any more. I just feel that everyone gets sick of me at some point or another and I am at the point where I feel dead inside.,0
i feel empty and alone every day i wake up. I feel hopeless and lost. I feel afraid and trapped in my mind. I dread waking up everyday and i wish something out of my control would just kill me already. I have only one true friend anymore and even that is dying out. I have never had a girlfriend and I am still a virgin other than when i was raped by my brother. I feel so alone and I hate being alive and I am miserable everyday i live. I want to live and see the world because it has so much to offer but not like this. I feel guilty for wanting to die because there are other people that want to live but cannot. I hope my family will one day understand why i did it and will hopefully forgive me because they will acknowledge the pain i was going through. I am fighting to stay alive by this point,1
"The mornings are absolutely chilling.No matter the temperature. Now everyday she wakes up to realize no one will ever want to do that, hold her to sleep.Let alone touch her. Ever again. - me at some point. I have never wanted to be so far away in my entire life, I do not care where, anywhere but here but I cannot move and I cannot stop crying. So how do I leave without moving? I die. This week I have consoled every single person that has came to me for whatever reason specifically over one of the people I have oddly let see way too much of me so his friends they are, they do not deserve to feel pain. I do not want them to. I do not want to. But I cannot help it and it never stops. So I consider it karmic. I am just that bad.Not human, evil, always. I have not eaten in days. I am scared and alone. And I put on a facade for everyone else to make sure they are okay I have a routine every morning after this stupid dream that a singular person would hold me to sleep to text all of them and make sure they are okay and I am not okay and I have not been okay and I can scream that I am not okay at the top of my lungs;And no one hears me. This is how I know I am a real piece of shit, it will only because them more pain. If I off myself I will just be causing everyone more pain, everyday I check on them we are already missing one. Part of me does not care. I am alone. I am terrible.There has never been a good thing about me. I have been shaped by abuse and people pleasing and I am a void.On autopilot making sure everyone else is okay.Well take some time alone.Oh with my thoughts? The ones that are telling me to blow my head off? Someone said intent is all that matters and I always thought my intentions were good or justified. When I die and I already technically have before so its going to be awful but it is much better than me being me. I do not deserve anything good. that is obvious by how much harder it is to wake up everyday and I am so confused and scared. I cry for thirty seconds and wipe my tears and make sure everyone is okay If they need me to comeover if they have ate. I can feel my stomach gnawing at itself. I deserve this.

"My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep. I think it was the weed combo that did that sorry for wasting your time if you r reading this ik its a lot of writing. here is my story (15M)",0

"I am a 31 year old man and I hate myself. I hate the way my face looks, I struggle to lose weight, and I do not even like the sound of my own voice. I get such extreme anxiety when talking to people, especially for work. Started a new job that I thought I would love and that id be set for life for and I just feel like an imposter trying to fit in. My manager let me know that I am not doing good and that I am struggling to learn or communicate with others. I have never felt like I fit in anywhere either. I have tried and failed to make friends SO many times in my life that I have completely given up. I never even attempted to get into a relationship because I know when I get rejected, I am going to take it so personally that I am going to be a complete wreck. Its why I am still a virgin who has never even been kissed or been touched or been on a date before and I have a porn addiction now too. I spend hours looking at porn and edging. Now I am so afraid that I might be turning gay or bisexual because the only porn and fantasies that turn me on anymore involve sex with other men. I constantly go on grindr or omegle and sext with other men all the time because they are the only ones who i get a response from. If my parents ever found that out about me they would be so disappointed and would disown me. I do not want to off myself but I do wish sometimes i would just pass in my sleep.

"In March after a year of rejections, I finally got my dream job and I was happier than ever. Everything was going well but then I lost a few members of my family and took a week off as a result. My job acted supportive at the time so I did not think this would affect anything. Less than two weeks ago I moved to the city where the job is based, cementing this new stage in my life.And today I went into the office just to discover that they are not passing my probation and are terminating my employment immediately.This came as such a shock to me as there had been no mention of my performance in the past outside of when I was struggling because of bereavement. So it seems like they have this front that they are supportive of people with mental health issues but in reality they do not want to deal with people who have them.I am so broken and I do not know what to do. I worked so hard to get this job after the pandemic ruined my life and I cannot even get this right? My mental health always finds a way to fuck up every good thing in my life and now I am 25 and alone in a new city with no job.All the healing I have done over the last couple of months bc of my bereavement has just disappeared and I am back at square one. I feel like my life will never be good and Id rather be dead. I cannot take this anymore bc I am a disgusting failure.

"I have been thinking about it for a while and I am going to take a lot of anti-depressants causing me to have serotonin syndrome and overdose. To be honest, I am really scared but I have to do it. I cannot take it anymore. I cannot keep on pretending like everything is fine and ok. And I am sick and tired of people underestimating my depression, even my therapist. All the people I know, including my therapist, do not believe that I might actually hurt myself. They think that all I do is just whine and complain but will not actually do anything about it. do not get me wrong they do care about me and love, it just they do not think that the depression I have is severe. I need to do this. I do not want to live anymore. Also, I need to show them that when I say that I cannot take it anymore and I am going to kill myself that I am not just overreacting. I am scared and terrified of what is going to happen but I would rather do it than keep on living for one more day. On Sunday, I am going to overdose on Prozac and DULoxetine",0
"I will just introduce a bit.I am 21 years old.Currently on an internship away from home.I have struggled with depression on and off. But lately suicidal thoughts have been worse than usual.It keeps returning.Every morning I just want to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger. Every night before I go to bed. Same thing.I will be honest. If it were not for my lovely parents I would have done it. I feel lonely, I feel like there is avoid inside of me.I work in hospitality and with children.And I can smile temporarily when I can bring people a good time. But I just feel like my smile is not going to last forever.I feel like I am rotting away on the inside and I just do not know what to do with it.I have been procrastinating on my school assignments. I just want to lay in bed. But even that is starting to be invaded by my suicidal thoughts.I just do not know anymore.What do I do with it? Why does it keep returning?",1
"the suicidal thoughts are back. I feel like this is only getting worse. I tried having hope. tried therapy, three of them did not help. the fourth tried but made me feel worse. my ed just gets worse, my ocd too. I probably have bpd too. I have just gotten to a point where I believe living just is not for everyone, and happiness does not exist, atleast not for me. I am being there for my boyfriend but I am doing a shitty job at it. my parents are struggling financially and I am just worrying them and making them waste their money on me and therapy. this time, I am going to do things differently. I am going to jump so there is no backing out. I am not telling anyone so they cannot stop me or even try. I have written two out of three letters already. I do not know what to tell my boyfriend. I really do not want him to end it too because of me. I do not know how to make sure he will try to get better or atleast be strong and stay. I have planned my outfit and I know I am going to spend my last days with people so they have happy memories. I am going to bake a cake too for them. my last cake because ik that is one thing they would remember me by. I am not strong enough for this everything that is happened in my life has broken me to a point where I am just unfixable. I am sorry but this, it is happening. the thoughts are back",1
"here is my brief story :During my childhood I was very discret and I did not have a lot of friands. Until 13 girls never talked to me because I was not the cool guy who ran fast, I was rather the quiet kid. During middle school I had some friends but no girls seemed to like me. So I convince myself girls should not like me. Probably because I am ugly. But in first year of high school, I fell in love for a girl. And after 1 year, she and I started a relationship. I was really really happy, but 2 months after, she left me for no reason. And this is the beginning of my depression. During the first months, I have never gone outside my house, I have tried killing myself twice. I was totally depressed, I did not want to live anymore. A part of me has disappeared, and I have not found it yet. After 18 months, I feel better, but something is not the same since. I have no more self confidence. The self confidence I gained during my relationship disappears 2 months later. Now I am sure people cannot like me. But here is the problem. I really like a girl, but I know she is way out of my league. And I think she will reject me so I do not try anything. I do not know how. So I think I will be lonely forever, because I am too afraid. I think I will be lonely until the end",0
"Do you think that depression may because sleep disorders? -such as somnambulism- I am trying to know why is happening to me right know. I have been thinking that maybe, sleepwalking/talking is related to emotional stress or a side effect of depression (or anxiety). Any of you have had the same problem? Parasomnia (sleepwalking or talking)",0
"What can I do to escape from this feeling?I feel fear of how to be alive because I lost and I do not have any confidence to overcome any of the struggle in life. I feel like I suck at everything.I quit my job again my superviser hates me because I hate that job desperately and he figured that out. I just thought that work was like a totally waste of time I just need some amount of money. And he talked too much stuff meaningless every single day. He was the most talkative person ever I have met in my life and what he said hurts me a lot. he had the opposite perspective for everything like what is the meaningful and how to live, etc. He always tried to persuade me and urge me to agree to his opinion. I eventually lost my patience. I could not stand anymore that situation repeated everyday so I quit.I do not know why but I still feel tired. just tired and depressed because I know that I fail to deal with that difficulties again to become a person well-communicated. I failed again. I feel empty",0
"Hi guys, this is my throwaway account because I have friends on my mainI am bairly 13 years old and I want to dieEveryday I wake up I feel hopeless like there is nothing to do or I am nothing just an anoter person just living,everyday it just the same as the other feeling bad constantly saying ""sorry"" or ""excuse me"" for no reason then crying myself telling myself I am not good enough I know you guys cannot do much but I really want your help What is the point?",0
Approximately a month from now. I do not care if it gets better. I just want to end it. I thought id just slit my wrists and quietly bleed to death while I am tired in my bed. Is there any other easier ways ? Planning on taking my life for my birthday,1
Lately I have been having concerns in regards to my current mental health. A good chunk of last week was spent in an emotional numb state. I was finally able to break from that after some intense intrusive thoughts. They should have terrified me but I found myself enjoying the experience. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or has any advice? Could use some help,0
knowing how long I have had to live with people feeling that I just do not have an attractive face. Trying to discuss this with therapist made it at times damn near impossible to talk. I am a 23 year old guy discussing looks and attractiveness in therapy would always nearly bring me to tears,0
"I gave myself a year to try to be happy. But I am not. My therapist sucks and always ask the same three questions. My medication stop me from feeling anything which at first was great because anger and sadness were gone. But then I was just completely empty. I felt nothing. So I changed it to something stronger. But it' s exactly the same.Sometimes I feel great. Like, oh great today I do not want to die ! And the rest of the times I just wish things were done. Quiet, silence. No pain, no regrets, just the wonderful emptiness that is death. And in those days, I have no one to call.No one is here to give me a hug, to say I love you, and to listen to me cry. I have parents, a sister and friends but no one to call to say I need help. Please hold me. Please anyone... In those days, I just want to know what keeps me from dying. I just want to be happy for once without guilt or shame. Is that too much to ask ? And why am I still alive ? I have no one to call",1
"Hi, 25 M, this a brief story of how I went from being lonely to have great friends and then back to lonely again.I am a corporate slave. My first year at work was not that good since I did not have much responsibilities, yet in my 2nd year I become more a valuable team member. The problem is that my social life become more miserable when my professional life is getting better. I am an introverted person, I have my small circle of friends. The issue began when I traveled abroad (Work related) and come back to the company after 3 months to find out that everyone has forgotten me, not only there but my hood friends also has forgotten me too. I had very close friends, but only a 3 months separation has ended my relationship with my best friends. I become the same old lonely person I used to be, when I thought that this has been changed after I met my new friends. But I was wrong, I am by myself now. I do not have any one to share my stories, my ambitions, my daily routine. I want that simple check in question to feel that I belong to this world, to be valuable to someone at least.Adding to that, I started to like my best friend, we were very close but after the 3 month separation, our relationship become very cold, it made it harder for me to confess to her. Being alone and failing in love with my crush which does not share the same feeling with me.Just wanted to relieve my chest of this grief. Any tips would be very helpful. Lost the will to hmm ... Everything",0
"You can tell me whatever the fuck you want until you are blue in the face. Just do it. You got to start somewhere. Its not that bad I promise. do not care what people think. Just be confident. Fake it till you make it. Change your mindset. Think positive. Be grateful. Nothing does anything for me. If anything half of those things make me feel even more hopeless. I guess I just want to be this way and I am wasting peoples time pretending anyone can change that. I am a lazy, defeatist, loser piece of shit. Nothing helps",0
Basically yeah. Every relationship I have had has ended because I was not always sexual. I feel like its a momentary thing that does not need to happen all the time. Opinions ? Or am I just a flawed human. Females do not like me because I do not enjoy being sexual 24/7,0
"I have the past 5 years I have had multiple year plus sober periods but I cannot shake this depression and funk. I have tried meds, I run, write, meditate, have had great jobs, eat good, supplement. Pretty much everything they say helps and I makes me feel a bit better but some days its hard and I can barely function. I always end up going back to drinking due to frustration from never feeling better. Doc says I may have treatment resistant depression which I have no clue what that means, shock treatment or lobotomy lol? Just venting I am annoyed. I have had docs tell me I might be bi polar and others tell me no way because I am 28 and have never been manic. A few adhd diagnoses that were rescinded. I am doing every freaking thing possible I can to feel better but nothing seems to lift the dark cloud and its robbed large chunks of my adult life. I feel like I have been depressed most my adult life and I have always been told if I get sober from alcohol my depression will improve but it does not.",0
"Take your meds, exercise, stay busy. This is the only consistent advice I receive. I am not really looking for advice, I just want to die. I thought life was going decently for a little bit, I still wanted to die but at least I was being social and having some modicum of fun. But recovery is a lot of hard work, more than I can bear right now. So I will go back to wallowing in self pity and isolate myself from anyone who could show me fake love. I know they do not really care. They just do not want my death to inconvenience them.Hope some people can relate to wanting to shut themselves off from the world. I feel like I have always been crazy for this. Took all my willpower not to drive into oncoming traffic today.",1
"I am wide awake, thinking about life. A 20 years old with no concrete plan in life. No motivation to do things. I barely have any friends. I am studying a degree that my parents want me to. I have no purpose in life. I have never truly been happy. I always live in my head. This small fantasy world that I made up from the expectations that I want myself to be. I feel like a fraud. I am useless and good at literally nothing. Every time I get out of my head, the reality hits and I feel like my world is falling apart. Sometimes I just want to be okay. I do not need to be happy. 4:33am",0
"TW: Suicide, maybe eating problems &amp; body issuesI'm not attractive but I feel the need to become attractive. Although I appear quite nonchalant to people (easiest way to hide my anxiety), I have tried eating and vomiting to lose weight but that did not work in the slightest for me, I changed my hair to look better and I plan to get quite a few cosmetic surgeries in the future. In my eyes, I feel like as a Black young adult, no one ever sees me as approachable or relatable. Most first assumptions are that I am the Big, intimidating, rude kid. I did not ask to be me, I did not ask to look like this or be tall or be unattractive. I feel like for every fashion aesthetic I have tried to feel less of an outsider I feel like a poser. Furthermore, I hate my body since my body proportions mean that I cannot fit into a lot of clothes. But there is no one to vent to. I took it upon myself to get a referral to counselling and I am currently on Anti-depressants. And no matter how much my situation improves, I still feel shitty inside. I recently had a whole day where I just cried non-stop and every time I would calm down, the tiniest negative thought would bring me back to crying. Even now, I do not cry i.e. with tears, but I feel like I am breaking down and become restless.I find that I try to relate to fictional characters, music etc. I recently saw Scott Pilgrim V. The World, and I rooted for that lifestyle/aesthetic such as his sarcastic friends and his whole love triangle situation. And I will daydream, wishing that I could have such a life, rather than being bitch of a giant.I feel like no one can accept my vulnerablity. I tried to cut myself to show my classmates so they would leave me alone, but I did not have the courage to and my mum later saw it and made fun of me and compared me to a teen white girl. I want to lose weight so I seem less of a giant. I remember being younger and being seen as cute and that was genuinely one of the best feelings, because of the security I had, the fact that I was allowed to be vulnerable and cared for. But now, I feel like an outsider, an embarrassment. I continue to help myself, because realistically I would be seen as selfish if I killed myself (Also, I would hate for people who give me shit everyday to claim they cared about me and I do not think I should kill myself over other people) but deep down, I feel like this everyday. I do not want to be me. Can someone give any advice/support on my situation?",1
"I am a 15 year old kid and I have been struggling with what i believe is depression. I have so many trust issues with relationships and friendships, i hate the way my body looks even though I am working out to try and fix it but sometimes it just feels futile. My friends hate me, the reason i think this is because my one friend group they all make fun of me, call me unfunny, annoying, and one dude in there always call me an emo depressed kid who should just kill himself. I really only have my mom, and a couple of friends but i feel so embarrassed to tell them how i feel. My dad is a horrible father and contributes to how lonely and out of place i feel. And a couple weeks ago i went to my friends birthday party and me, him, and his friends smoked weed and it was the first time for me and for once in my life i actually felt something. I have been craving that high ever since but idk who i should ask to buy edibles off of, or if i should even do it. i have not tried self harm nor do i want to because i know once i go down that road ill cross the line and i do not know if ill be able to come back from that. I need advice on what to do.",0
"Please do not blame me or anyone else. In fact, I was unbelievably lucky to make it this far. My parents are and always were caring. My brother and sister have always wanted the best for me. I just have a malfunctioning brain that makes me unhappy all the time. Even when I am happy, it means that I am about to do something terribly irresponsible and stupid that will hurt those close to me. The best thing I can do for everyone involved is to bow out now. To those who say this is a selfish move, you will be over it in a couple of weeks, but you would rather condemn me to a lifetime of misery. Id just like to send a big Fuck you to those guys ;)In case you are interested, I am still in love with Tessa from high school, and a girl called Bara who I met at a drumming circle this summer. AnonymousPS to my daughters Abbey &amp; Zoey: I can never do this because of you. I love you too much and do not want you to feel like this would be your fault.

"I am not trying to be dramatic or anything but I honestly just hate life and want to die very badly. Living is constant mental pain and i hate it. I have also come to realization that life is pointless and it has no meaning, even if life did have meaning I still would not enjoy it. In my case suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem because my problem is that I hate life and that is never going to change so, suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem for me. Suicide is the only thing that will fix my problem and give me peace. I seriously do not want live anymore. 16M",1
"I believe that if you end suffering for yourself (assuming you succeed) - you will start it for your parents. If your parents have helped you or supported you in any way throughout life - do not do that to them while they are still alive.you would be creating a world of pain for people who truly do not deserve it.

The only thing I am looking forward to is death.Death is the only place where I can feel peace. If I am dead no one talks to me. If I am dead I cannot feel anything. If I am dead I will not exist on this shitty planet.Now why do people fear death so much? When it is literally an express ticket out of here.

"Last year was the low point of my life. My wife left me, I had gained a massive amount of weight, my sleep schedule was completely out of whack, I was extremely depressed, constantly felt weak, never wanted to leave the house, etc. Also worth noting I have been balding since highschool and my sex drive was at an all time low.Needless to say, I saw another post on reddit someone with low T levels describing their symptoms and it was like reading an autobiography. I went to my doctor and sure enough, my testosterones was at ground levels. The doctor got me set up on testosterones therapy and the results have been life changing.Since then I have effortlessly lost weight, I am in a waaaaaaaaay better mental state, my sex drive is through the roof, I am hitting the gym (something I thought I would never say) and I am even dating again.Seriously, if any of these symptoms describe you go see your doctor. it is way more common than people realize and nothing to be ashamed of. Getting my testosterone levels checked saved my life. [27M]",0

"I am 26. When I was a teenager, probably early teenager, I had likea prophecy slip into my head: I was going to be dead at 30.And its always made sense to me, dying by 30. In a way its a little bit of a relief: just a couple more years then natures going to pull the plug on me. But its also scary. Like what if I am in my 30s and this dumb body is chugging along??But ever since I was 21, I have only got x more years in this world can you shut the fuck upI joke to people all the time, I am going to be dead by 30. I was not built to last.And ever since I was 25, people ask where do you see yourself in 5 years. I honestly have to bullshit that. Because I REALLY think I am going to be dead. By freak illness. Or freak accident. Maybe someone will send an assassin after me!!!I think of all the creatives that die just short of 30. The forever 27 club.

My parents are very controlling and will want to call me every night. they will want me to visit every holiday. But that is not happening. I am done feeling guilty about wanting to cut ties w my famuily when all they do is make me feel like shit. I am crying right now",0

I am 15f and I have already told my mum I wanted to kill myself like a year ago surprised I did not but now I want to again I am not going to go into detail but I have nothing stopping me for one final cry for help I was going to tell my therapist that I am suicidal. I was wondering if she is just going to tell my mum and that is the end of it and nothing happens or does she actually have to call the crisis helpline and get me help because this really is my last chance and if this does not work I will kill myself. Please help Can my therapist send me to a psychiatric hospital?,1

"Does anyone else want to go because they feel life is pointless? I do not care about the simple things life has to offer. I have seen how everything can be perfect than crumble down. I do not care about being strong or fighting adversity, I just want to be at peace. I live for myself and Id be happiest not being stressed.

"So, my birthday is coming up soon, and just like every year, I am dreading it. it is one of the worst days of the year for me. it is also one of the days that I think about dying the most. Not necessarily through suicide but by any means, like, freak accidents, accidental overdose, just anything that will end my life. Nothing ever happens, but sometimes it makes me wonder what would happen if I did die. How would it affect my loved ones?Has anyone ever lost someone close on that person's birthday, and how did the passing of this person affect you and the other people close to him/her? I am mainly looking for people who died by their own choice, but if it was due to other causes you can still comment. I, like many others here, want the pain to end but do not know if I can go through with it if it will hurt those around me.please only post if you feel comfortable. Ending it on a birthday",1

"For the last two years I have struggled with hardcore depression, which was only made worse because I feel like my life has been pretty great so why do I feel so bad. Everyone else I know has been through so much and I think they look down on me for it. I dropped out of college during my first year because of it. Two months ago now me and my best friend of 9 years stopped talking for good, and while our relationship was toxic looking back I just feel worthless. I am going back to school this semester, I have been getting into old hobbies, I have a dog which probably saved my life multiple times, and my family is pretty great. But I have no friends whatsoever. I have pushed everyone away or everyone is left me, I feel like I waste my days online and I just do not know what to do. I want to make friends so badly when I go back but she will be there and everyone else who has walked out on me. I am not medicated though I have been but I do not feel like awful as I have a few months ago. But I do feel a void. I do not ever hang out with anyone and I am just lonely. I do not feel like I have anyone to do anything with, and its been making me a nervous wreck.

"Everyone has their own lives and it is dumb of me to expect people to remember when they have said they will do something for me....but is it really that bad of me to expect people to remember me? I asked my roommate last week if he would drive me to a biopsy I had this morning, and he had come back super late the night before and was asleep when I needed him. My sister who has been helping me with my car payments had said she would be able to help me with the payment today, and we even talked about it yesterday and still, she forgot. I hate being a burden and I hate asking for help, so even ASKING these things of them is so fucking hard in the first place....having to remind them is even worse. I ended up just driving myself to my biopsy because I did not want to bother my roommate by asking him if it was still OK. I do not want to bother my sister about the money even though the payment will bounce and I will be charged an extra 100 in late fees because of it. Its literally so humiliating asking for help, especially when it comes to money, and reminding people that they said they would help is even worse. I really think I would just be better off letting the cancer take its course so I do not have to bother anyone anymore. I really really REALLY hate this. I wish people remembered me",0

I do not feel like competing in the rat race anymore due to constant mindgames and people spitting on me and my ambitions... and there is no alternative for survival (from a monetary standpoint). There was a point in time when I had dreams and every time I tried for them I got shot down and destroyed by the very people in charge of being able to make said dreams possible. Every ""job"" I have had, I have either had the dickhead bully or the asshole that does not see that I even exist. Any opinion or idea I ever have is dismissed and belittled. To be honest I have contemplated just saying fuck it to work altogether and being homeless. Perhaps I would starve to death in my sleep or die from hypothermia at some point in the near future.

"Has anyone else just accepted suicide as their end? The ""Five Stages of Grief"" are often used for general sadness, but they were intended for people in terminal life situations. I think suicide is the same. I used to be so depressed thinking about dying, but now I have come to accept it. It does not even bother me anymore. I am privledged and fortunate enough to have had a great life up until this year, so I do not feel like I am missing out on anything by living; I have already gotten everything I wanted out of life and have made lots of great memories, and now is my time to go. Suicide is just the final chapter of my story, and it is not even a sad one, I imagine it will touch a lot of people and motivate them to live out their lives and seek out happiness in a way I cannot.

"I have a rather normal life. i go to school, i have friends and do stuff with them, and even if my mom is bipolar and has a heavy treatment for it and most of the time i have to Look after my brother because he has some bad anxiety, i generally feel like in a loving family. But then i still feel like shit and I really do not understand why. what is even more confusing is that i do not think about it when I am at school and around my friends, except when i say something weird/stupid or when i get a question wrong in class, in which case i then blame myself for it and really hate myself for the rest of the day, sometimes even the next day. I tell myself that I am a stupid piece of shit, that I am a monster who hurts everyone around him, that my friends like me just out of pity and that my teachers pray for me to shut the fuck up every time they see me, etc etc. there is also this weird, horrible feeling of not belonging with my friends that i get sometimes, just like when you enter the wrong classroom by accident, like i do not fit in. it is like looking at them just to see how happy and not caring and just enjoying their life they are, and how i simply cannot be like that. But then again it is a state of mind that I am not always in and realizing that makes me think that I am liying to myself and to others, like I am acting a scene just to get some attention that i do not deserve.At the end, I am just here wondering what the fuck is happening to me. People have told me that it kind of sounds like depression, hence why I am posting this here, but i really do not have a fucking clue of what is going on in my life, and I am too afraid to go see a doctor because it would mean telling everything to my mom and I feel like she would not take it seriously, plus she already has enough problems herself. I have also tried psychologists but they are either too expensive in order to be viable on the long term, or it is a cheap alternative that i do not feel comfortable with and that generally does not work for me.And still, these thoughts are killing me.If you have any advice or idea of what it could possibly be (or if it is even a real thing at all and not some random casual problem that I am just egoistically complaining about), that would help so me much.Thank you very much in advance I feel so fucking empty and I do not understand why",0

"I visualize my current scenario like a War Field. My side has lost, i cannot run and all i have is an old timey revolver and an army to fight. But, the bonus to being this near death means you no longer fear consequences, you just do things for the hell of it.I will try to condense my life, I am a school drop out, i have extreme social anxiety/body image issues due to Cervical Dystonia and i need surgery for that. That got me bullied like a black kid in a KKK gathering, i felt like killing myself as a teen as well, i barely had any friends. My dad was a self absorbed jerk and i rarely spent time with him as he was divorced and lived in an another State, my mother is emotionally unstable and resentful of me for not becoming a Man. I have an older brother, he supports me&amp;mom(South Asian Culture), he has never been emotionally cruel to me the way my mother is, if there is one thing i regret is that i could not be useful to him, he does not have anyone else close in his life but i do not want to be a burden to him anymore. Perhaps, the ironic thing is that i was born 6 months(24 weeks) premature, doctors said I would probably die without NICU(which was not affordable). I am nearing my 30s now, i have yet to learn how to socialize with people, my Open Education(equivalent to HS degrees) exams are months away and i have not even gone past the first chapter, its cus i have not opened a science book in nearly a decade. I am partially to blame here, i chose science because Art degrees are not known to lend itself to gainful employment but holy hell the stress&amp;self-doubt will not let me learn. I have done fine with all subjects but i always struggled with equations&amp;theorems and now there is really no way for me to get a degree unless i get those right. It also kind of pains me to admit to myself that my mother is very similar to the horribly overbearing school teachers.So anyway, this is my life.

Life elbow dropped me before i was even born and i had to operate in absolute loneliness for most of my life, this computer kept me company and even that is dying now.

"I feel like I am getting sick and tired of the lockdown. Feel like I need to do something more. Right now, I am waiting for an acceptance letter from a university I have been wanting to enter. At this point of increasing Covid 19 cases in my country, it is getting more likely we are going to do online learning (if I ever got accepted). I was thinking about getting a job but my mother will not let me. Not to mention, being jobless is slowly becoming a huge problem in my country. Also, the spreading Covid 19 cases makes me worried about my family members who have to work outside of the home.I feel like I am wasting my life. I am going to turn 18 this August...I am getting sick of staying at home. I do not have my own room which means I do not have any privacy for me to be alone( Slept in my mom's room do not even..). My mind feels like a mess. Sometimes, I silently cried about it. I cannot cry out loud to avoid pulling my family's attention. I have trouble sleeping, I slept way too late and excessive sleeping during the day. Just today I woke up at around 2 pm. It was horrible. I feel like slob waking up that late. When I am attempting to sleep early, I ended up passing out about 3 am (sometimes 2 if I am really tired, but it usually way later) Am I losing interest in my usual hobbies? Not that I lose interest. I am just too lazy to draw anything. My mind is blank. I tried to listen to music but I did not enjoy it as much as I usually do. I tried to read a book called ""Midnight City"" but I have trouble focusing. I tried to journaling how I am feeling every day but, every I repeat the same routine. The same emotions, the same sleepless night. So much thought inside my head yet I cannot explain it. My head is a MESS.My final choice to makes me forget about everything I cannot do; is watching Youtube. Just watching something. Although, sometimes I just stare at the screen not really listening to what I am watching. I feel horrible that I feel like this, I know there are people suffering worse than I do. I should feel privileged the fact that I got a roof over my head and a mother who cooks me good food. And of course, I am. No words can describe how grateful I am towards my mother. I need to reorganize my mind. But how should I do it? I tried my best to explain how I am feeling and sometimes I feel like I cannot take it anymore.

"I do not get it why people assume everyone else would even like to be alive. I personally have never had any reasons to be alive at all.

It was the final nail in the coffin I think. I am dreading every single day and I am soo soo miserable every time a new day arrives. I have no hope or direction in my life right now nor do I want to continue living, why would you expect me to go on fighting for my life if I myself do not even want to??Why do you put your values and expectations on us. I have experienced too much pain and horrendous shit As well that has caused me to be even less interested in life than I already was. Up until now I have been a bit scared to end myself bc I cannot seem to do it quick and painlessly. However, the fact my situation is deteriorating and I have 0 euros on my bank right now with a lot of debt ill just starve slowly I suppose.

"here is an evening ramble for you all. Not looking for help, just a friendly ear (eye?) if there is someone out there. Thanks for listening to my LONG rambling thoughts Warning: they are not in a great order. More of a stream of consciousness? First, someone tell me why prescribing some Xanax a few times a year to help someone deal with the physical symptoms of anxiety attacks is worse than the drugs I have been on since? I live a stressful life. I got that. Choices have consequences. Mine is anxiety. Prior to 2020, I would have 2-3 anxiety attacks per year (heart racing, high bp, uncontrollable crying, sweating, no sleep for days, etc.). A few Xanax would break the cycle and Id be back to myself in a day or two. 2020 was rough on everyone. My anxiety attacks became more frequent, so I was recommended to go on maintenance meds. Since November 2020, I have been prescribed a combination of Lexapro, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, Mirtazapine, Hydroxyzine, Seroquel and more. These drugs have not only NOT helped my anxiety (in fact, its so much worse), but since taking them they have caused me consistent physical ticks, involuntary muscle spasms, insomnia, tinnitus, disassociation and suicidal ideations, uncontrollable crying, headaches, blurry vision, diarrhea and other digestive issues, weight gain then weight loss, loss of coordination and balance, loss of motivation, and severe depression. Oh, and most recently, hyper sexualizationI literally humped the corner of my dining room table and I am generally a total prude (I guess some side effects are not all bad lol)Who knows what is permanent. And now I might actually be crazy (and horny) af. I have come to accept that I am going to be alone thru this process, whatever that means. I am fortunate to have people in my life that want to help. But their help does not help me breathe. I cannot breathe. I cannot seem to ever catch my breath any more. And I cannot sleep. Oh, sleep. How I miss getting more than 2 hours of true rest on a good night. And stress? The stresses that generally do not bother me just pile up on my shoulders these days. It makes even walking up a flight of stairs what I imagine climbing Mt. Everest without oxygen would feel like. Id rather lay in bed. Sometimes I have to and nap in the middle of the day. (Did I mention I was once an ultra runner? That me is very embarrassed of this me)I have called out to my doctors for help and just get passed around. No one that I have worked with yet seems to understand nor appreciate mental health, wellness, and safetyemergency and urgent care personnel, law enforcement, psychiatrists at least those I have seen so far. Even my pharmacist punted on my questions.Those side effects I brought up earlier? Every one I have brought up with my dr has been answered with either a new prescription or assurance that I need to give the medication more time to do its job. I do not trust her my psychiatrist any longer. And when referred to a different psychiatrist for a 2nd opinion that may be good to speak with, I have to wait 8 weeks before they have an available appointment. Wtf?Honestly, most of the time I do not know how to feel, how I am supposed to feel, or how I am supposed to live knowing that there is really nothing out there meaningful for me. For any of us. I should be happy. Satisfied. By all senses of the word, I have achieved someone is vision of success. do not get me wrong I am extremely thankful that my loved ones, pets, friends, colleagues, employees, and I are all healthy. I have an awesome husband, make good money, have a great family, own a home, etc. I even own and operate a successful business and fund a local non-profit.But yet I still feel like I have no purpose. I seriously feel so stupid just thinking this way. I am sorry. But every day is the same. The movements throughout are merely a distraction until the day ends and it all starts over again. I tell everyone I am fine because I do not want them to worry. I keep my problems to myself since there is no one to share them with that can relate anyway. Its easier to bottle up the feelings so they do not hurt anyone.See what happens when I let them out? This. I am a damn mess. I am better than this. But I cannot control it. Any of it. I have been thinking a lot lately. Why am I here? Why are any of us here? We are so very small in this universe and here for such a short time. Its just a distraction until we eventually die. Really? Life seems like a while lot of effort for nothing. But this understanding makes it easy not to care about anything much anymore. I know I should not be thinking this way. I should feel grateful to wake up every day to what I have. So many others have things so much worse. But I am tired of showing up and being someone else for everyone else. I am tired of simply going thru the motions without real emotion. I am tired of not being able to tell what a real emotion is. I am just tired. But sometimes my dreams are so real that I question which is the waking world versus which is the sleeping world. If it was not for these pills I am taking, I am convinced I would not be here. I did not think they were helping until I stopped taking most of them. But seriously, if I keep take them I feel like I will not be here much longer either. Maybe its the pills talking, but nothing feels fine any more. But Ill be fine. Eventually. Maybe. My husband is convinced I do not need any of it. Medicine, help, etc. Not sure that is the right answer and I am currently a fucking mess. But then again, hes usually right. If you are still here, thanks. I am a disaster and could use a friendly ear",0
Does anyone have any tips for anxiety and suicidal thoughts? Tips,1
"I often feel the only way to make people take my depression and possible underlying causes seriously is to actually kill myself. Especially family, who I feel are supportive in some ways but downplay my depression. They do not take it seriosuly when I say I cannot handle work and life. A certain family member is the worst- stating before that I just get a little down sometimes (that phrase still makes me want to punch a wall)or that he notices others inc himself feeling depressed in winter or that he had trouble keeping a job when he was younger. He gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation. That does not solve the problem of the actual job! I am sick of being minimized.I feel (and maybe I am wrong) its just minimizing my condition. I mean hes supportive in other ways. But I am still angry and I feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument I feel, having failed at anything in life the only I can have the final word or any control is to kill my self - successfully. A failed attempt will only make me more of a failure. I mean I know there has to be a better way to deal with this I just do not know how. Confrontation will not help, Ill just sound more desperate. Staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help Ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more. I can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking. Its not an solution its not even leading to one. People only take action, especially irreversible violent action, seriously. How to make people take your condition seriously without having to kill yourself ?",1
"The only people who truly understand, truly, are the ones who have been on the brink. who have dipped their toes in the unfamiliar water of death and had to fight themselves not to go back for more. The soldiers who are fighting every day to stay alive for other people, not for themselves. It is a critical, defining and monumental moment in a persons life: the actual choice whether to live or die. Most people make that choice every day without even thinking about it. They live with a careless contentment in everyday life, perhaps annoyance at the obstacles, the roadblocks that all get in our way from time to time. They have no idea what it feels like to open your eyes and feel an instant dread wash over you- clammy hands, pounding heart, sinking stomach. guilt so strong it takes your breath away and you have to remind yourself to take it one day at a time. One hour at a time. One minute at a time. Because you cannot bear the thought of sticking around for another day let alone a whole lifetime. I am 23, and it has taken everything in me to get to this point. I am at the prime of my life and I feel old and decrepid and so so tired. An exhaustion that is so all consuming, it forces me back into bed every time I try to dig my heels in stay out of it. I am a tired old dog who just wants to be put out of its misery.

"I wake up everyday with this sense of impending doom and then I lay there for a few hours until my housemates, who I avoid completely since I have lived here have left the house, then I creep out of my room to get some food then scurry back in before anyone gets home.

"that is basically my entire life! Very few pieces of dust I can actually grasp on to, and its all fleeting anyway. I am not necessarily depressed in the most classic sense, I am just so fucking bored.... everythings the same almost every day. Its just fuckin exhausting, the monotony. Same thing literally every day, especially at work. Homes the same. Drive home is the same. I would say my day off is the same, but I do not have one. Workin every fucking day, 7 days a week, all night shift.

"I have fucked everything up and let it go on so long it is irreparable. I can barely handle day to day life as it is I cannot even imagine trying to fix things on top of it. there is absolutely nothing that brings me enough joy in this world to make up for all the stupid bullshit we have to put up with just to exist. Nothing I do ever ends up making a difference. Every attempt to improve myself has left me worse off than before. I tried to go to college, that just led to me getting bullied like a bad teen drama. I worked so fucking hard and went so far out of my comfort zone and my professors did not give a shit. None of them remember me, I cannot get any references and I have not gotten a job in over 2 years of looking. I just spent three years and $16000 in absolute misery.I tried to improve my relationship with my family. But everything I do they see through a negative lense. No matter what I do, they manage to spin it so that I come out selfish, spoiled and lazy. I tried to improve my figure by working out, but now I am just skinny in places I need fat, fat in places I need to be skinny, and have unfeminine muscle mass in random places. And surprise surprise, it did not shrink my massive ribcage or reduce my hipdips or help straighten my spine. I tried hair removal, now I have unsightly strawberry legs and the hair grows back funny. I started moisturizing and wearing sunscreen, but the damage is already done so it just leaves me looking like a greasy pig. I tried taking birth control to help cope with my period, but it made it worse. And when I went off it, my boobs shrunk. I was already barely an A cup. And losing what little volume I had in the front just accentuates my kyphosis. I have always been ugly but I look so much worse, you would think I would let myself go rather than finally start taking care of myself. I am embarrassed to run into people I used to know. And it is only going to get worse with age. I am so fucking anxious about ageing. Knowing how much uglier I have steadily become over just the past 5 years, I cannot imagine what 40+ more will do.I cannot be happy living alone. I have tried but it is just too easy to spiral when there is no one to distract you. And you feel so isolated. I know if I ever committed to living alone, I would just give up completely. I will not get any sleep, then I will be too anxious and apathetic to go to leave the house, so I will just lie in bed and stare at my phone, while leaving the house gets harder and harder, and I will end up starving to death. But a relationship is not an attainable goal for me. Straight men hate my guts. They pointedly ignore me at best. Even if someone is desperate enough to give me a shot, they will never like me. I am too repulsive and awkward and cringey and annoying. I have no prospects in life. I am pretty much just bumming around my parents house til they get sick of me and kick me out. I have no prospects for a career, relationship, independence, friendship, a happy life. Everything is too hard and complicated and I have too many regrets. I am just not cut out for life. It feels too late for everything",1

"First off, I have never been officially diagnosed with anything, but after tons of research online I have concluded I definitely have MDD. Not sure about any sort of anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, or any other stuff like that. I am very frustrated because I know I can get help, but my parents will not have it. A long long time ago i tried telling them about all my stress, which was about 1/4 of what I am going through now, and they dismissed it entirely. They basically refuse to let me have any sort of independent thought that do not like. Usually just scoffing and invalidating me in similar ways. I do not want to call the the NSH, but a friend I have been talking to has suggested it. Another big issue because by my parents (and other small events over time that sortabuild up) is trust. I do not trust said friend that she actually cares, and instead feel like she is just going through some sort of checklist. Please help me guys. I am physically incapable of believing that others legitimately care. Is there any way for me to get help without my parents knowing. Yes I know this post is all over but its relatively short compared to what I am actually going through and I am just really confused rn. I have parents that prevent me from getting help for my MDD",0
"The memories I suppressed for so long suddenly triggered today. I remembered how I used to feel like I was trapped in my own world and how i was suicidal in junior school, at around age 10. I remember how my mum used to go into rage at mistakes i would make or me being annoying. I remembered how mum would tell me to put my arm out for her to hit me, and if i pulled my arm back in fear, she would threaten to hit me even harder. I was really fucked up back then. Every other night Id think about running away, never having to face anyone who would hurt me or berate me or make fun of me like my classmates and teachers at school would or like my mum would at home. I think today was the day my old self that i had abandoned to heal finally came back to haunt me. Just needed to write this down. I just needed to write this down",0
"I do not know how posts on this subreddit are normally structured, so apologies in advance if I am doing anything wrong here. I just started dating this girl that I have known for awhile, albeit not super well. We hung out at prom back on the second to last Friday in April, but over this previous weekend she told me some stuff that only a few others know. Apparently, she has a very painful memory from back when she was 3. And apparently, that memory is truly traumatic. She cut her hair even though she hated it, she cut her wrists horizontally to feel physical pain to try to block out her emotional pain. She apparently decided that at the end of April, she was going to commit suicide. Thankfully she did not because her friend needed to talk to her and she missed the deadline of 11:59 April 30th. she is been going to therapy since then. However, she says it is not helping. She still tries to cut herself but since she moved to her grandparents' house and their knives are dull, she has to resort to other methods like scratching herself or using rubberbands or starving herself. She never told anyone what the trauma was, only that she tried to kill herself. She says she does not plan on telling anyone, and that she wants to keep it bottled up and hidden forever, and that she does not want to feel anything anymore. She refuses to tell her therapist about it, and when i asked her last night for the detail of ""did someone do something to you"" she said yes and had to scratch her wrist with her fingernails to find an escape. I do not want to keep causing her pain like that, but I am terrified that she may try to commit suicide again, and that this time no one will happen to need her help. She is adamant about not talking about the memory, but seems to be willing to answer minor questions i have, but when she answers them she has to hurt herself to get through it. So... could someone give me an idea of how to help her? How Do I Help My Girlfriend",0
"Like basically every night I think about whether or not I should do it and the main reason that I do not is that if I do not die I will probably go to the hospital and go to like a psych ward or something and I just do not want to go through that. But I also vaguely like the thought of trying and not actually dying. Would it be somehow cathartic to do something that almost definitely will not kill me but feels like I am killing myself just to see if I would do it? I used to live in a place where I could just off the building, but now my only real option is to take a bunch of pills. I collected a bunch of pills from around my house and have them in my room. I have a glass of water rn. I could take them. I do not think I want to die right now. Idk. Every single day feels exactly the same. Last time I made a real plan to do it, it felt final. That day I felt that feeling of *today, today, today* (I never actually attempted). I feel like I am just waiting for something to happen, for a day to feel different from the others so I can feel that feeling of finality, and just come upstairs and take all these pills. I guess if I actually wanted to do it, I would have stopped trying to do my schoolwork by now. I am so scared of attempting and not dying. It would make everything so much shittier. Risk of Not dying is the main thing stopping me",1
How helpful have you found support groups - whether online or in-person to be? What are the pros? What are the cons? Can you find them to be draining/depressing/terrifying?

"For the billionth time, it feels like, I am getting ghosted by a girl I was seeing. This one hurts a lot. This is the 2nd longest continuous hook-up I had with someone and the most 2nd most dates. She seems to have lost interest in talking to me or hanging out. I am not certain what will happen with this but it does not really matter. I do not think I live for myself. I do not enjoy most aspects of my life and if I could end my life and reboot or wipe myself from existence and my family and friends would forget about me I would. I would do it without hesitation. I do not want to keep on living. I do not think I will ever be happy and it seems like all I might settle for one day is just not being miserable. I hate my therapist. Not because she is mean or anything, but nothing she says ever makes me feel better. The skills coaching she always makes me practice does not work. It feels very dismissive. I do not get any relief from my anxiety or anything like that. I only do not kill myself because my friends would be sad or because of my parents. I am beginning to resent them for loving me and wanting me alive. I see them succeeding and moving forward with their lives and I just feel like everything I do is a chore and is so painful. All the happiness I experience is temporary. I know how I would kill myself. If I have 3 different things going to kill me with high rates of success then there is virtually no way I would survive. I just wish I could be anyone else. That I could brush off heartbreak. That I did not get attached, or that my luck was good enough that I did not have to worry about these things. But I cannot fix any of these things. I cannot change who I am and erase all this bad luck and pain. So I should just kill myself. I am not living for myself anymore",1

I have closed myself off and hid my feelings for so long that i really do not even know how to use my voice anymore. not for things that matter, anyways. I attempted to tell my friend I attempted",1

Alcohol and mental illness stole my life from me. I should have graduated university a couple months ago. Instead I am on day 8 of not calling or going to work at all because I woke up too hungover and withdrawing last Monday to even put in the effort to call in. It would have been fine too; they would have probably seen it as a positive that I called at all. My bosses are incredibly understanding and know I am struggling. I have pulled this shit like 3 times in the last 4 months. I should have been fired a dozen times. I just keep disappointing everyone. I am the black sheep of my family and I just want it to fucking end I really need someone to talk to. I have not wished for death this much in a long time,1

I feel like our future is fucked with corrupt government, AI that decides we suck, or some other horrible end such as our energy grid going bye bye. Pretty damn close to just cashing out my investments and savings, going to pay for hookers and try and get myself as fucked up as one can be.

"I moved to his country a year ago after I finished my education (Msc in computer science). it is really on the countryside and it turned out that there is zero need for my skill set. Nobody here cares about software, they do not know what they should put me to and everyone tells me to ""just work with something else"". After applying for jobs and being in a foreign country for eight months hearing about how I should work with something else than software; the depression hit like a hammer. I have take a software job now in my home country and I am going to move back in two months. But right now those two months feel like....... Never ending. I love my bf deeply but I honestly do not know what I am saying anymore. I just want to get away. I want to be alone so I do not hurt him more. I just say something. I say ""sorry"" even I do not truly mean it because I know that is what I am supposed to say. I say ""I do not care about your mother or your family"" and ""I do not care about how you feel"". it is completely fucked up. I am shocked about myself saying these words when I think back. Everyday I am angry at him, everyday something is wrong, everyday is negativity. Yet, he is just loving and caring. I just do not feel anything. Everything is numb. I cry all the time.

Next week we are travelling to see my family and it is going to be the same: ""What happened to her?""How do I survive those two months?

After dealing with this disease since 2006 I attempted to hang myself. I tied it off around the doorknob and leaned forwards. I guess I did not far enough though because as I started to blackout my legs caught the weight. Now idk what to do. Should I try again? It finally happened,0

"I do not want to give you all some BS motivation, say you can do it, or life is hard. I want to give you guys a story of mine.I am not going to bore anyone with details, but from a young age, I was basically physically tortured as a child. I thought it was all normal until one night I had a major epiphany on an acid trip/deep conversation at 6 am.After this realization, I became majorly depressed. No money, no friends, no energy, no thoughts, and just drugs.I spent a month in my dorm room (freshmen year) doing absolutely nothing. I slept 12 hours a day (9 am to 9 pm). Pissed in bottles to avoid leaving my room, ate 1 sandwich a day, got high, and listened to music. I did not care about anything. I eventually moved back in with my parents (stayed depressed for another 5 months), stayed in school, worked, and eventually graduated. I now live with my gf and our dog. I still have some issues but nothing I cannot handle.I just want to let everyone know that story and I hope everyone finds their own way. Tell your story here and I will read it with a genuine reply because I know what it is like. It never goes away, it is a cycle that keeps us awake some nights.For those of you that are in the situation that I was in, try to do 1 or 2 things a day that are good for you. Whether it is brushing your teeth, or eating one more meal than normal.. &lt;3 Depression Community Story.. sparking hope?",0
"I know people talk about how much we hate ourselves a lot here because it is very common for depressed people. I was wondering though if others feel this; A rational part of my brain knows I should not hate myself as much as I do, because the level of hate i have for myself is the same as the level I have for the worst people. Now I might be kind of a worthless piece of shit but also I am not that bad. I do not get violent with people, I have never sexually assaulted or done something really fucked up to people. Probably the worst I have done is say some hurtful things and lie. Even though the rational part of my brain can look through all this and go 'well i guess you are not the worst piece of shit, it dosent really effect how I feel about myself. I still hate everything about me from my stupid body to my stupid mind. I know its probably a bit much for what I am but god fucking hate me. Hate myself vehemently even though I know in the grand scheme of things I am not that bad.",0

"It is almost time for my final tour. It kind of reminds of when I inititially tried to do this vacation almost 18 months ago. I was supposed to go on this trip in March of 2020. I was to leave on a Saturday, and on Friday I had to cancel because everything, including the hotels shut down. I had to cancel the day before my trip, actually day of, as I was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything. Now, here I am, about to head on the tour I was supposed to have, and 2 days before I am about to leave, all mandates are back on. I am not against this at all. It is just funny, that the eve I am about to go again, and all things are on the verge of being cancelled. I waited till everything opened, to make sure I could do everything, and what do I get for my patience. The eve before I am to go, mandates back on.I think I said this in the first post, but regardless of whether this trip happens or not, I am killing myself. And if I cannot go, it makes sense, since it will be exactly how my entire life has been, with dissapointment. If I can go, I guess I can just sit in my hotel room alot. Go out get food, to bring back to my room, and eat it cold. Makes sense actually. Fits my life.So close, but never quite there. If I go, if I do not, by the end of August, I would say read my obituary, but there will not be one, or if there is, it will just be, he lived... and now he is not. I cannot begin to tell you how angry, unhappy and frustrated this news makes me. Maybe a good time would get me out of my funk, bit its just more dissapointment. Think I would be used to it by now. This one just stings me alot more. My whole body feels empty now. it is like, you know when you are really hungry, and you stomach feels like it is sucking inside you, my whole body feels like that. My arms, legs, toes, fingertips. Everything on me feels empty, and it is a weird and uncomfortable sensation. I am almost tingling, but not good tingling, tingling that is excruciating. And it is not painful. it is all in my head.Fuck my life man. Fuck my fucking life. Forever unhappy .04",1

A regular apartment flat with no special amenities whatsoever (basically the basic basic house) is easily over half a million.

How am I ever going to save a 5-figure to get plastic surgery. I also want to ride a motorbike, costs money. Moving out, costs money.I am also still a student so I have to live in a way I fucking detest for at least another year. I am already 20, I wasted a quarter of my life and I would not be surprised if all of it is wasted and it is why I just want to kill myself.

"Hi I am new here, I actually created this account because I have no one to talk to.Last October 2020 I quit my tech job due to burnout. I had a boyfriend then and he was really supportive. Earlier this year I keep on getting sick, I had chronic sinusitis. Now, my boyfriend and I broke up and he already moved on. He looked so happy, I have never seen him that happy during the entire 6 years we have been together.I feel so alone and such a failure. I lost everything that gave my life meaning. I do not want anyone to tell me it will get better or I should try harder, because I already did.Every night I am praying and wishing that I will not live so see another day.

"I have been bullied by classmates and teachers alike for about 10 years. Although I mostly remembered my classmates making fun of me, insulting me, pulling my hair and god knows what else, with time I realised it was the teachers and my parents that had the biggest impact. I have had teachers that would often make fun of me in front of the whole class if I gave the wrong answer or did not know how to do something. Either that or just screaming at me. One of them would often tell me I am a failure and I will forever be a disappointment to my parents because I, the daughter of two engineers, was not great at math. My parents suggested I move schools at some point but the thought of being thrown into a new class with people who already knew each other scared me even more so...they did nothing else. Whenever my dad tried helping me out with my maths homework, he would sooner or later lose his patience and scream at me as well. he would sometimes throw my notebooks in anger as well. I was so terrified I did not have the courage to say anything at all, being convinced that none of the answers I could come up with was right. I thought it would be better to just not say anything, but that just made him angrier. And the same happened at school. I just became too scared to say anything at all. We never really talk about this. Whenever the subject comes up, they of it as if it is just another funny story from my childhood. it is very hard for me to talk about it; whenever I try to explain how I felt they just brush it off and act as if it was not all that serious. they would often make jokes about me being rather introverted and quiet, often in front of other people - and they still do it, to this day. My mum especially likes to ""excuse"" my quietness in front of other people as if it is this terrible flaw that just needs to be explained away. I have asked her not to do that, explained why it upsets me, and every time it seems like she gets it...until the next time when she does it again.Luckily I do not live with them anymore, but whenever I do go back for more than a week, something like this always happens. I wish they could just understand and accept it. My experiences and feelings are still being invalidated to this day",0

I hate the way I look, the way I think, how I behave, I also feel so invalid, everything in my life works, I have a gf, friends that care about me family that would do anything for me, but I do not know why every time I lay in my bad, I can only think about how I kill myself, I feel so alone, even though I am surrounded with love, in my head nothing matters.

Of course, there are some instances where I am happy for family members and friends who have positive things happen to them, but if its someone who has either ignored me (especially if the opposite sex), I get an especiallyyy good feeling when I see bad shit happen to them.

A meaningless investment, nothing more. it is better for them if do not exist. At least they are going to save some resources. My existence does not mean shit.

"A little while and you will no longer see me; again a little while and you will see me.Then some of his disciples said to one another, What is this hes telling us: A little while and you will not see me; again a little while and you will see me and, because I am going to the Father? They said, What is this he is saying, A little while? We do not know what hes talking about. Jesus knew they wanted to ask him, and so he said to them, Are you asking one another about what I said, A little while and you will not see me; again a little while and you will see me? Truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy. When a woman is in labor, she has pain because her time has come. But when she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the suffering because of the joy that a person has been born into the world. So you also have sorrowfn now. But I will see you again. Your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you. In that day you will not ask me anything. Truly I tell you, anything you ask the Father in my name, he will give you. Until now you have asked for nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. Sorrow Turned to Joy",0

"I am in my bf's room and I am going to go to my new job in 6 hrs. I needed comfort and hugs to feel secure and lessen my anxiety. I explain my worries and how I feel useless, then later, I tell him I wanted to get food from downstairs with him. I wanted some food to ease my anxiety. I ask him if he was hungry. He tells me no, then I quickly change my decision bc I did not want to make him go down with me if he was not going to eat. He snaps at me and tells me hates when I get like this. I ask him if he was annoyed w me. He tells me yes, bc you are not like this and you would normally go down for food if you were not feeling so anxious. I get extremely saddened by what he said, I think because I was already not feeling so good and him saying that made my tears well up. I get quiet and look away because I did not want to choke on my tears. He asks me what is wrong and why I am not saying anything and he sounded more annoyed when I was quiet and shaky with my responses. I just wish he would be empathetic rather than trying to fix things and be logical all the time. How hard is it to give someone a hug and comfort them and tell them everything will be okay. Whoever reads this, please, any words of comfort will make me feel better. Thank you. I just want comfort",0
"earlier yesterday, i heard my mother on the phone with a potential therapist of mine. getting to know her. not asking me to talk to her to see if i felt comfortable. for context, i said that i felt suicidal to a therapist and they told my school &gt; told my mom, had me sent home for the rest of the year. due to that, i cannot go back without getting cleared by a doctor because they do not want to deal with students with mental health issues. anyways, I have always been the third-wheel in my own recovery. i never know what is happening with my medication, my status as a student at my school, or the therapists i might see. on the phone, my mom is trying to explain to the [new] therapist why I am feeling this way:its because of covid, you know, all teenagers are depressed now.i do not think she fully understands the fact that I have been struggling with this for years. in middle school, i was lazy and not motivated to do anything at all. i constantly missed school and did poor with everything. sophomore year, before covid hit, i was seeing a therapist and breaking down every session because i really did not want to live with myself. i got a really bad ankle sprain, my social anxiety took over me and i did not eat for weeks. this is not new, but she is acting like it is. my close friend passed because of suicide and i think she magically wants me to realize that it is not the answer.I am in no way complaining about my mom trying to get help for me, but it feels like she is being forced to do it (which she is). she constantly tells me, do you want them to kick you out of school? and prioritizes me being at the school i am over my mental health. all of this pressure to not say the wrong thing while I am meeting with the therapist only makes it harder to be alive, knowing I am disappointing so many people. invalidated",1

"This is a lengthy post but its a summary of my life so far. The time line is a little jagged but that is only because I am in so much pain and I just want to put this out, I apologize if its a bit messy with typos, punctuation and grammatical errors. Depending on who reads this, this might seem like an anonymous post ...or not. I am in my 30's and I am just not in a happy place right now, actually I have not been for a while now. A brief insight into my life. I have not had one. I come from a poor background and also from a poor country. As a kid I grew up in a religious household, that is not to say there is anything wrong with being religious as I am a christian myself but in this case my family thought it would be our way out of poverty, it was not. My father became a pastor and I had to maintain a certain code of holiness from a very young age, I could not express myself as I wanted as I had to maintain this ""code"". My mother made home made pastries locally and I aided in the production of the pastries as well as supplying the products within the neighbourhood, so my early years was basically going to school, making the rounds to supply pastries and then going to Church, after a while the church closed down as we could not handle the financial demands to keep up with the Church, my father was a good pastor and a good man and never thought of taking advantage of his members for financial reasons. I graduated from high school and I had hopes of my family coming together to support me with my plans of getting a higher education because deep down I knew very well that as a family they could if they wanted to, but they did not, I figured it was down to me to raise the money required to go to college, I managed to do this at about 18/19 years old, I raised some money which I intended to use for my education but I could not use it for that purpose and here is why - At the early age of 19, I started providing for my family- paid the house rent, food etc you name it, I provided it, it was not just me though I had some assistance from my immediate elder brother. Now make no mistake, this is a large family and I am the last child. So basically I did not have a life as an adolescent and I did not have a life as a teenager as I became some sort of ""family man"" or ""bread winner"" at the age of 19. This made me skip my entire teenage life completely as I was more concerned with helping out with in the family naively looking for a pat on the back and the occasional prayer and well wishes from my family, this made me ignore my plans of going to the university. Somewhere at around the age of 25 years old, I had planned to move rent my own apartment and apply for college but the guilt of being on my own while my family struggled to pay for the rent stopped me from doing that. I was afraid they would think of me as someone who was selfish and uncaring (they eventually went on to think of me that way anyway, I once caught my mother and one of my brothers talking about how frugal I was and how I was a ""wicked"" person). I decided to stay with my family, I paid the rent from when I was 19 till I when I turned 30, when I turned 30, my parents decided to move back to the family home in the country area (I also financed most of the developments in this country home but that is a long story). I was now left in the apartment with my immediate elder brother, during this time I remembered my plan for college and started asking myself why I never acted on it, I had totally depleted my funds by this time so going to college seemed impossible as I still had to contribute to the house rent, my immediate elder brother contributed as well. Along the line I made some investment in digital currency , nothing much but just a decent amount, fast forward some years later and the boom happened, I got a good return on my investment and I decided to give even more to my family (again), I sent some money to my parents, My elder sister was due in a few months so I also gave her some substantial amount of money and then I gave my brother who I shared he apartment with some of the money so he could invest in himself and start a business. and I gave him some money to buy a used car and together we decided to move into a better apartment. After a while, we had a little argument, a very silly little argument,my brother became very angry and then he told me that he has been keeping this information away from me but the entire family have been talking behind my back and they ALL wanted me to move or travel away so they could move on and be happy, he told me my sister (the same one I gave some financial help for her kids) he told I had no friends and I was socially inept and this really hurt me because I felt betrayed by my family. This is the same family I literally sacrificed my entire life for - I lost contacts with my friends when they all went to college and I stayed back helping with the needs of my family, I never had the time or privacy to have a relationship or a girlfriend, I never had my own apartment, I never had the chance to learn how to drive a car, I never had the chance to go to college and looking back, I never had a birthday party despite the fact that my older siblings have had numerous ones, the excuse my parents made was that I was born when when the financial situation of the family got worse and to some extent I get where they are coming from and I hate to sound selfish or insensitive but surely somewhere between when I was one year old to my age currently, there could have been some sort of birthday party or at least something that the family could do to show some kind of appreciation and gratitude..... maybe i am just being silly. I would admit I might have seemed down and sad sometimes but that was only because I was depressed, sometimes I find myself day dreaming about the changes I could make if I had a time machine, yes its silly but that is just how I feel about my life and how I totally messed it up by forgetting myself and my needs. I neglected all these things because I prioritized the needs of my family over that of myself and to hear that my family now think of me as a source of negativity or as someone who they need to get rid off totally broke me, I am stronger than hurting myself and I know that is not an option and would never be an option for me but it just seems a lot right now. I have not been able to sleep for days as I have been wondering how it all went wrong for me. I thought about leaving my properties - clothes, laptop, phone (these are all I have anyway) and just walk away to a totally different place for months, just so I could make my family know how I feel, maybe make them think something happened to me but I decided against that as my parents are old right now and I would not want to because some kind of health issues for them. I had a phone conversation with my mom and I told her what I had planned to do and why I decided against it and she was crying on the phone, I stopped myself from crying but she has been calling since I told her, when I ask why she keeps calling she says she just wants to talk but I know she is worried that I might hurt myself, this made me feel so much pain that I had tears running down my eye while I was on the phone with her but I really held back so she would not hear the pain in my voice. I am really not sure what to do now. I would be deleting this very soon as this is very personal for me and I do not want it out there, my brother also visits reddit sometimes and I do not want him to see this, I do not want this out there but I had to talk about it. What would you recommend I do now? How do I heal? what do I do now?",0
I am planning on hanging myself here shortly. I am a 18 year old guy who has fought with depression all my life. I have never been good enough for any friends or girls in my life. My parents just separated. And I have no plan for the future. My life consists of sitting alone in the dark playing all the memories of when I was happy. I am convinced it will never get better. I would rather try and shoot myself in the head because I feel like there is much less time to think but I am to lazy to get a gun so a rope will have to do. Hello and goodbye !

And then this bomb dropped on me. I think they are not going to stop until they can watch me completely crumble and die. I do not want to give them that. But I am starting to worry that I will never be free of them and that I will never feel safe. I will always have to protect myself from them. they will try to get to me any way they can. that is not a life I want to endure. My abusive ex is lying about me sexually assaulting them to get revenge for outing their abuse and I am thinking of killing myself.",1

Nothing is really causing that spark anymore and for the past few months its been quite hard to focus on anything or feel any real drive to pursue anything.

My life is similar with most peoples lives, full of ups and downs, but somehow I just have so much hatred, guilt and anger inside me.

I want to be able to wake up early and sleep early and even though I can sometimes keep that schedule going for a few weeks at a time, I always end up staying up late one random day and ruining it for myself. I am currently unemployed and sometimes I find my days completely flipped to the point where I am sleeping at like 8 AM and waking up at like 4 PM. It gets annoying because I wake up feeling like the day is already over and I do not have time to get anything done. When I was working I was always sleep-deprived and running on like 4 hours of sleep because no matter how early I went to bed or how tired I was I could not sleep till 4 AM. Why do I have such a hard time falling asleep at a normal hour, regardless of my commitments and activity level, and how can I fix that (and maintain it)? How do I permanently maintain a good sleep schedule?",0

What is the point ?I am a 33 year old female who gets laughed off because her problems are not seriously enough. I have borderline personality disorder and as much I habe fought it has take over every aspect of my life. I basically quit/got fired form my job when I chose to show my overdose. One of who I thought was my friends completely hates me because I threatened to hurt a guy who lead me on at work and lead to my bosses finding out that I have a problem living life. I would have been described to be given everything. My dad did so much to even come to North America and my mom did the same . All I needed to do was live up to their ideals and I could not even do that. Instead of being the nurse like everyone else I knew I was different and I was such a burden to my parents. I did end up becoming that nurse but all it caused was piano because i never did well and always had a panic attack or a freak outburst at work.m I have always thought of myself as a loser the only thing that has changed was the title. The only real suicidal plan I had was taking a bunch of lorazepam but that was caught . Truly I want to die and I do t know why society forces you to live What is the point,1

I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time.

"The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall. ~ Marcus AureliusHow many of us, do I wonder, have felt the physical thrill of playful fighting with another as a child? Testing your strength against your father, perhaps your mother, as a child? Or play fighting with friends using sticks as magnificent swords of truthiness, and imagining the jungle gyms as your castles?As a child we all desire to be someone magnificent, no? Someone grand, who can fight the monsters and demons life throws at us, and be a beacon of hope and love for our fellows. Or mayhaps that might just be me?Because, as a child, there comes a time when we realize we are not so magnificent, we are not so powerful and full of divine strength and wisdom. We as children are faced with many moments where we are utterly helpless, and must rely on the love and kindness of others to get us through the day. I would say that we are children still, and always will be, until death teaches us our last lesson. I have come to realize that not one of the so called ""adults"" that surround me, truly know what they are doing. And I say that in a sense of, what they are doing with life, more so than what they are doing in their field of work or with their hobbies. I say that we are all still children, struggling our way through something that no one knows about, for what truly is life? What truly is the reason we have come into being?Have you ever had a child ask you question after question? Why is the sky blue? Why is the grass green? Why do I breathe? Why do I eat? Why am I alive? Why? Why? Why? it is like they are wrestling your mind this time, instead of testing their strength against yours. I worked, for a time, in a children's rehabilitation center for those who had been sexually assaulted, had sexually assaulted others, were addicted to drugs, had anger issues and have murdered. Children. Some were adolescents, some were only 12 in age and had been passed through the system because their mothers and fathers could care less about them. Why does not my mother love me, I heard once. I had not an answer. I did not know who this child's mother was because she never bothered to come visit. All I knew was that she had issues of her own, nothing excusable mind you. The child clung to me because I had answered so many of their questions before, but I had no answer then. It was only days later he was begging me not to let the police take him away. It broke me, because I did not have an answer then either. I digress, I live in a past moment. I state this because these children were wrestling their demons, but no one had taught them how too. No one had cared enough, it seemed to me, because no one wanted to, or truly knew how to, handle them. Granted there were maybe two others besides myself that wanted to do their best for the children, but its easy to burn out against a system that only cares about the money these troubled youths bring them. I do not ignore their transgressions, never that. But these were children. They were wrestling against traumas no one bothered to show them how to handle. They were mimicking the so called ""adults"" in their life they were told to trust. They were doing what was done to them. It made me truly understand that every other human being might be wrestling against their own demons, and with no one in their corner, how can one expect them to face the hundreds of opponents and circumstances that life always throws at us?Do you wrestle without knowing how to wrestle? Yes, that is how you learn. Is it easier when someone that you can trust helps you, teaches you, and shows you how to wrestle? Yes. What I am saying is there are a thousand, thousand ways to fight something. You learn alot of that on your own, and you may not know there is a better way to do it, until someone comes along and bothers to show you.My final point, is, as Marcus Aurelius states, humans, animals, organisms, will wrestle with many things in their attempt at life. Or in other terms, to live is to struggle. Knowing that, should we not all attempt to make it easier on others? Knowing that you yourself have been through many matches where you were outnumbered, with no one in your corner, can you truly blame yourself for just trying? For when the bell tolls, it signals your match is at its end. So Live. Struggle and survive. Wrestle, fight, war against life. Do not fall , stand tall and rage, rage against the machine.And stop being so damn hard on yourself For whom the Bell tolls, the wrestler, the pacifist, the young and the old, the struggling, the peaceful, the villain and the bold.",1

"Because of my anxiety (and depression?) I live in constant fear and sadness. I am so afraid especially with everything related to my 2 year old son. I fear that I cannot control myself when he makes me angry, I will hurt him and traumatize him for life, just like I have been hurt and traumatized in the past by my own parents.I fear that when he accidentally hurts himself, I cannot help. When he was a baby, he almost choked on his food and I froze completely. Thankfully his mother did not freeze. That incident haunts me every day. It makes me so sad that my little boy had bad luck in life and he was born with me as his dad. He deserves better. My wife deserves better. I deserve better. Because of my anxiety I cannot even drive a car and every social contact scares me shitless. I do not have any friends and I try to avoid social contacts as much as I can, that includes all my relatives too. As a man I am a complete failure. I cannot fix anything, I am not socially competent, I am poor, uneducated, a bad father and a lousy husband. Complete and utter loser and a total failure. I am too coward to seek or ask any help and no one knows how I feel. Everyone thinks that I am just a cold-hearted asshole, but that is so far from the truth. It hurts me so much that I cannot show my loved ones how much I truly love them. Only times my life is somewhat tolerable is when I am alone, but I cannot be alone all the time because I have to work and take care of my family as best as I can. When I am alone at least I can cry freely. I feel completely exhausted all the time and no amount of sleep fixes that. My heart feels like it will come out of my chest, I feel like I am suffocating and I feel like that I am about to faint. My mind is dull, like I am in somekind of fog. I do not feel any joy, just sadness and apathy. I do not have energy to play with my son or treat my wife with the affection she deserves. Every time I am alone with my son I am so afraid that I almost cry, and when he is especially difficult I sometimes just cannot help myself and I openly cry and yell to him. I am such a piece of shit and he deserves better. I know that killing myself will hurt my loved ones, but I just do not care anymore. It will be better for them in the long run. I do not want to ruin my son's life anymore. His life will be better without a mentally unstable parent. My life would have been too. I just do not want to be always afraid, unhappy and exhausted anymore. I tried my best, but I just do not have the strenght to live anymore. I just do not have the strenght to live anymore",1
"Even when I try to do homework, I just stare at it for hours. It does not help that it is somewhat hard and I am behind already. I am pretty much looking for anything I can readily get/use.

"I would like to start by introducing myself, my name is Zen. And I have dealt with suicidal thoughts my entire life as long as I could remember. In my earlier years, I never really had a reason for them, but I still had them. It was not until high school that I started understanding the thoughts I was having more. I was never able to get them to go away, but when I would feel them I would feel like I had my own reason why behind it. It was not until after high school that the thoughts grew into more serious and detailed descriptions of acts that my brain would actively play for me as I would think about them. And it is not until now that I begin to truly ask myself the RIGHT question.Is it more important to live and percieve well OrIs it more important to HAVE lived and percieved well. Is it okay?",1
I have started a new job after being unemployed for 6 months but its going horribly.

I always tell myself ill move out of my parents house and get a apartment to keep me going. But i keep saying to myself i want to end it. Fuck life Just want to die,1

"Once I post here, I feel terrible. After a while, I just have to do it because I cannot get it off my mind. It makes me feel like an attention seeker. that is why most of the time I write ""just a vent post"". While I want someone to see, I do not want them as well. it is odd. I do not want to be an attention seeker so I delete it after a while. I am probably going to delete this after a while. I wanted to post this because I saw a post a couple (week, days?) ago, and one of the comments mentioned people deleting their posts after a while so I wanted to see if you can relate before I feel the urge to delete it again. I sometimes think as if I should not post here and feel guilty when someone responds because they could be responding to someone who is actually struggling and needs help but they are wasting their time on me and feel the necessity to apologize. The friends that I have are online and I am kind of scared that they would think I am an attention seeker or something similar. Maybe they would hate me if they saw it so that kind of plays into the role of me deleting it. I am unsure of most things and often think I am faking it so I want to beat myself to a pulp. that is about it. If you stuck around then thank you for reading. Hey, just a question. People that delete their posts after a while. Is your thought process the same as mine?",1
I am closer than ever to doing it. I keep imagining how my parents will feel and how my sister will feel. I keep reflecting on my life. I keep thinking about how tragic my death would be. I keep trying to talk myself down every day and imagine a better future but none of it feels realistic and everything just seems to be getting worse for everyone collectively and I have no desire to move forward. I do not see a good future with me in it. I feel like I want to die every day. I am at 30 seconds to midnight but I cannot do it. I have been crying all month,1

I was originally rejected from this offer and it was literally the straw that broke the camels back. I was so fucking done.

I cannot feed my family, all my bills are late, family is calling me a loser and a disappointment. I was so drained. I still am and I still want to die but I have to cancel my august plans to kill myself because FINALLY I have a chance.

"I was diagnosed with major chronic depression 10 years ago, but I have been struggling with it for pretty much my whole life.I have tried so many things to try to correct it. Counseling, medications, change of diet, exercise, CBT, IPT, meditation, moving, spending time with family and friends, hobbies, art, etc. There are ebbs and flows, and some of these things have helped, but I still feel broken, lost, hopeless. They keep saying, ""depression is very treatable. We will get it figured out."" But I am still depressed. I have PTSD, anxiety, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, and chronic fatigue also, so I just feel like this hopelessly broken misfit.I keep trying. And every time something new is introduced, I get optimistic this will be the answer, but I do not know anymore.I feel like a burden, a disappointment, and a failure. I want to give up",0

"I have been trying different antidepressants recently (mostly SSRIs) and everytime I quit taking them in the first week or so. I just cannot handle the side effects - severe dizziness and this overwhelming feeling of inner unrest. So after doing some research I found St. John's Wort which according to one meta analysis I found, is as effective as common antidepressants but with much less side effects. ""Thirty-five studies examining 6993 patients ... evaluated St. Johannes Wort (SJW). The herb SJW was associated with more treatment responders than placebo. Compared to antidepressants, SJW participants were less likely to experience adverse events with no difference in treatment effectiveness in mild and moderate depression."" [Study]( looks really promising to me. I am currently taking about 700mg a day and I only experience very mild inner unrest here and there but nothing major. I hope to God that this will finally help me a bit. I will definitely update you guys if you wish. St. John's Wort is severely underestimated in my opinion",0
"Hey you all. I just discharged from the psych unit today after about 4 days of voluntary hold. it is hard to sum the experience up fully, but to put it simply, it was beautiful. I met some amazing people who were struggling right along side me. These people will forever precious to me. I was prescribed medication and I am feeling a bit better already (going through the weird/getting-used-to-it phase). Overall I feel that the visit gave me a new perspective and a renewed desire to live. To anyone feeling like they are at the end of what they have, do not be afraid to reach out for help. We can get through this tunnel together. Your life is precious and honestly it is worth a trip to the ER if you are feeling ready to give up. There is hope, and there are people who care about you and want to help you. Please do not be afraid of getting help. Thank you guys for always being there throughout these years, shit has been rough but I feel like I am finally on the path to crawling my way out of this. A small spark of hope",0

"So I am a week into taking Wellbutrin. About day 5 I had a few hours where I literally FELT things. Happiness, my surroundings, everything felt magical. And then the next day I am just irritable and anxious. The first two days were pretty awesome as well minus the odd dreams. And I notice I sleep longer than normal on wellbutrin as well so far. But yeah. Right now I am anxious. Depression is kind of worse. Abd I have the odd feeling in my right abdomen. does not hurt to touch but I can feel it flare up occasionally. Not painful. But definitely worried it is messing up my liver or something dangerous. Anyhow. I have been dealing with a pretty gnarly depression since having covid last year and I was hoping that this would help since SSRIs do not agree with me. Also, I have not noticed any improvement in libido. In fact, sometimes cannot even sustain an erection while taking this.

And all my mind keeps saying is just kill yourself to avoid it how does it make any sense, kill myself to avoid the panic, the worry, the thoughts? Sounds great but, I will not do it. That still will not stop me from feeling like I have to for the next few days. Its going to be another struggle for this period of the month.I just wish we really did not celebrate birthdays anyways, has always been terrible for me. Never had many friends growing up so it was always stressful. I really hate it. But happy rotation around the sun day you guys. Hope you all continue to rotate with me. Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Another rotation",1

"Well here it goes since this is my first post here and just looking for a positive comment or maybe some advice. I will start off by saying that I am 21 and unemployed. I have a GF and we are great together. I have family that is within an hour drive. I have a decent support system in my life. But lately I have just felt bland about everything. Any hobbies I enjoyed have kind of died and I do not have much hobbies other than gaming. While I have been unemployed for the last few months I have been trying to get my head straight, I quit my E-Cigarette mid May. Used to smoke alot of weed. Now I have cut back and using that as a reward instead of a nightly ritual. Since I have been off work I have been trying to figure out what my interests are and what I could see myself doing in the future as a steady career. I will be honest... I am a lazy guy. I go for walks sometimes to get me out of the house. Listen to podcasts. Apply for jobs. Gaming seems to be the only thing that I slightly enjoy simply because all the action is happening infront of me, I am not physically moving but I am controlling what is happening in the game so that is entertaining for me. I have gotten job offers and I always find something wrong with them, whether it be the commute, the pay, or the hours (too early or too late). I just cannot seem to get any traction, any motivation. I just do not really know what to do. I look at our planet and hate it because it is dying and we HAVE to do something but big company's are not doing anything. Society is breaking down slowly but surely. I do have a doomsday mindset I will admit and I am trying to kick it, but it is hard when there is so much negativity and so little positivity in the world. Everyone just keeps saying to me ""you will be back on your feet and feeling better once you get a job"". For some reason I do not believe them. I feel like I do not fit in this world sometimes, that I am a wasted space. That I do not want to live, but I do not want to die either. I just simply exist and I am not enjoying it as much as I once did. So what is a good stepping stone to start with? A rant about myself",0

I really do not want to die, I have too much to live for... people who need me, and I need them too. But sometimes it feels like the only escape. I want to tell them so much, and ask for their help, but I just do not know how. I am so tired of this... Rant/How can I ask for help?",0

I just checked my account I have less then 200 so I guess tomorrow will likely be my last day on this earth.I do not know why I am making this post guess I am feeling emotional today so many years of not crying and now my eyes start to water up now. I remember as a kid thinking if all goes to crap I can kill myself.Idk if I even feel bad I just feel so disappointed I myself because I bought myself to this I had so many opportunities to be successful or happy. But for whatever reason I did not go for any of them. Guess its only fair that I ended up here I know the kind of pos I am instead I hurt people around me to the point where in the last 9 months nobody has contacted me.It was my birthday last month nobody messaged me I am not saying this for sympathy because I definitely do not deserve it just to show I am pretty dead to the world soon I will actually be dead Tomorrow rant idk,1

"Hey guys,I have been very recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have been struggling with problems for around 1.5 year, and only now it came to light that it is psychologically, not physical.

When I get the attack, I have problems with speech, I talk slowly, struggle with saying/pronouncing certain words/letters. Can anxiety/depression because this during the attack?

"I am 23 years old. I just need a reset on life. I messed up this life too much. The more I live the worse it WILL get. I am not even depressed, I am in a pit, a bottomless pit. Which is way worse then a depression. Each day that pit just sinks deeper and deeper and the light just fades away. I am introverted but when I need to, Id play a character out in social settings. I am self destructing myself everyday. I am a predator, I prey on people, even my own family members. Mentally I am insane, psychically I am deteriorating, I am just losing. 2020-2021 is the year I have been the most suicidal. Probably because that is when most of the problems started. Honestly feel like its karma. I have done a lot of bad, bad stuff that just eats me alive. I deserve all the pain. If anything fucked up has to happen to someone,it should happen to me. there is nothing going on for me right now. Got money stolen from multiple times after I busted my ass to work for it, its just crazy. Why did I have to be put into this? I worked so hard to getting the thing that would ease my mind, and it got taken away.. there is no reason for this prolonged suffering. The more this goes on the more impulsive and psychotic I am getting !I am sorry to my younger self. I am sorry I neglected you. I wish I could have stopped doing those horrible things to you, unfortunately you had a monster growing inside you. Poor kid never had a chance. Self pleasure is the only thing keeping me alive, its the only thing that brings me euphoria. I am too apathetic for this lol. I am also possibly undiagnosed with a lot of shit, oh well I could care less. I also often listen to aiding audios every night that do help a bit. God forbid I get my hands on a gun! let us all just jump into a suicide pit! Fuck my life fuck my life up! But on the contrary who knows, I may one day find the light and come to consensus, as in the next 10 mins, but then bipolar comes back and I am right back into this pit. I am surrounded by so many people yet I still feel alone. I am not expecting anyone to relate with me. I am too far out of the loop. WTFFFFFFFFF. God is a cunt.

"they drag me along everywhere just so i can sit and watch them talk to each other, and every once in awhile will ask me the most basic questions ever like so how you feeling? so what do you think?, god people make me feel so unimportant, i hate my life and myself how did people get to the point of treating me like this? i thought i made it clear to people in my family that its HARD for me to bring myself into conversations but i guess people can never understand how hard it is. maybe they would understand more if they knew how much depression affects you and everything you do, because that is why its gotten worse for me but no one seems to take that possibility into consideration ever. and they leave me out while i hate my life wishing it could be easy for me too. and i can tell they do not want to invite me but do anyway to seem nice or something. though they act two faced and extra nice to me in public like I am a token depressed person or something. just because its hard for me and i cannot interact and i close myself off from everyone when they are talking in a group, and i do that because i cannot keep up with what they are talking about and have no knowledge about anything because I have isolated myself because of my depression for SO LONG that i cannot socialize nor look people in the eyes nor function anymore. anyway people in my family should know i have a hard time with talking and functioning now because i even cry in public but they probably call it me being attention seeking and twist it but oh well! everyone in my life just feels two faced towards me with fake niceness but will just talk down on me when they thing I am not hearing instead of addressing how i feel with ME. just tired of people having problems with people but never addressing anything everything in my life is a illusion. my family treats me like a liability and like i cannot understand anything",0

"I have no idea what to do at this point. I have had sleeping problems for years, but it was never TOO crippling, just falling asleep would take me 2-3 hours sometimes, so ""only some"" time wasted, but I would usually temporarily fix it every few weeks. But For the past 4 or 5 months it got so bad that most of my time was spent in bed, falling asleep would take 4/5 hours and sometimes I would not even get any sleep at all, at times 2 nights in a row, and during the day I would feel like a zombie. And absolutely no method worked. Tried meditation, exercises, changing my diet, meds, drugs, even getting drunk to sleep where I typically never drink. Would have completely botched my university semester if not for online lessons and cheating on exams like crazy. Fixing the sleep schedule was my main goal for those past months and since a week ago I actually did it. Regularly going to sleep and waking up at consistent hours for 6-8 hours of sleep. Problem is, I still feel just as tired and lethargic. Starting to suspect it is really just the stress and me being unable to deal with insecurities and past traumas. Everything I do either fails or frustrates and tires me. I would often draw to relax and try working on creating my own video game since it is been my dream for years but I am absolutely unable to focus on either. I do not even have anyone to talk to about it. My family never understood me and we are on bad terms for some years anyway. The friends I have had for years are only called friends because I dislike the word ""buddies"". Recently I got closer to a group of people online who I care for deeply and do my best to support when they have it hard, but I realized it is not a mutual feeling and whenever I would bring up some of my issues they would often get dismissed or met with a ""lol"" or the attention would go to someone else mentioning their problem. At this point I do not really care though. I just want to be able to focus on stuff I am doing. I am sick of wasting time doing nothing. I tried various non-prescription meds to help concentrate but nothing works and when I would ask a doc to give me strong stuff (back when I was looking for sleeping pills or the like) he would refuse, saying that I will only get addicted and ruin my health. My passions and pastimes no longer give me any joy and I cannot do them. Can medicine help? What kind? What to do?",0

I already know I am stupid, and at this point I am not even sure if my friends like me at all, the other day they went on a five minute tirade about how unfunny and annoying I am, What makes it worse is that I actually try to be a good person, and even with my best efforts I am still a piece of shit. I do not even know why I am here, maybe I am just begging for attention, I do not know, I am too much of a coward to actually go through with anything bigger than cutting, I have considered just driving away, but I cannot just make myself do it.

"i just cannot do it anymore. i do not want to live i just want to fade away but I am too much of a coward to do anything. I am a bastard, my biological father was never in my life. he never reached out or even tried to talk to me. i found out that in the December of 2019 that he has had other families and kids after me even though I am his first son and child. I have never even seen his face but i still want to have this man in front of me. not as a father, a person too talk to, or even just for clarity. no, i want him in front of me so i can finally put all my anger, depression, and anxiety that hes given me into punches, kicks, and slaps that will bring the world to an end. i hate this man with every cell of my being, and i always will. he was nothing but a drunk that would abuse and manipulate my mother while i was still in her womb. i still have very subtle but still somewhat noticeable deformities from this, like how an eye is above the other or how i have a dent in the back of my head. when i was younger we moved at least once a year to a different state. i could never make any friends because i would just leave them in a couple months. i felt alienated from everyone mentally at just 4. only person i could really connect to was and still is my mom. finally in 2010 we stopped moving around and lived in this blue complex. we lived on the middle floor while we had neighbors downstairs and upstairs. then in September my little brother was born. apparently something happened to him and this lead to him being underdeveloped mentally. this led to things like him almost dying multiple times. he did not even officially learn how to read properly until the third grade. in 2011 though, we had to move out just as things were somewhat getting comfortable. apparently a company in the nearby area had bought the land and area from the owner and they were kicking us out. luckily though we found a home a few months later. and we have been living here ever since. as i got a little bit older i started to be depressed by thoughts of my father and things i can never mention to anyone until i am very comfortable presenting them. this resulted in me having to go to the counselors office every week in 5th grade and having to act happy every grade after that. as time went on i started to lash out at people and started to develop anger issues that would and still result in me yelling, screaming, punching, and throwing things. i joined the wrestling team in 2019 during the beginning of 8th grade but i quite it this January because of how unhappy i am with myself. i would always go into weightlifting, practice, and tournaments thinking and having the mentality that i can achieve whatever i want and that things get better. sadly though i always left those events with the mindset that I am a worthless fat pig that cannot even run 5 minutes without whining. i did everything i could to the point where i would go in there and just yell at myself every time i waned to stop and give up. i would sit there stone faced pushing myself trying to prove myself worthy to my own mind and conscious. in the end though, that did not help at all because all i could see in the mirror was a fat kid that is considered a failure of a student, a failure of a athlete, a failure of a friend, a failure of son, and a failure of a human being. things did not get better after i quite though as those thoughts only got more powerful seeing as how i quite a sport after a year just because of my own mentality and thoughts. i started to become somewhat of shut in. i gained almost all of the weight that i lost back. i have been kind of skimming and passing through the days after that because nothing matters much anymore. especially seeing as how last month i was hit with the bombshell that my mother might be diagnosed with cancer and probably has it. i was not always a good son, but this is too much. i cannot have anything properly in this world in which i do not want to live in the first pace. my depression and anxiety have all be undermined or put to the side by others to the point that i do not even talk to my friends or family as much as i used to anymore unless i have to. whenever i try and improve my life either by exercise or anything else, it always gets taken away from me or i just run my own self into the ground mentally because i cannot see myself as nothing but a fat, worthless, unlovable, idiot who was not even loved enough to have seen his own biological father. i cannot and do not want to go on with this life, but I am too much of a wimp to do anything. i even tried running away but my weakness got the better of me and i returned hours later. why does it have to be me that has been dealt this hand. i want to die but i cannot do anything. i do not want to go on. I have had 15 yrs of life and do not want anymore",0

Memories of carefree hangouts I got to have with old friends only make me think about how I have got no one, how I do not talk to any of those people anymore, how I ruined the best friendship I have ever had, how even if I could somehow be back around all those people again it would not be the same because I cannot be carefree like that anymore, I am too riddled with guilt and shame about doing things like drinking.Its been two years since I have had anything positive at all to commit to memory, life has just been dragging on and as depressing as its been, I think its actually better than the alternative. I have lost every single good thing I had, I just do not think its worth the trade any more. Seems to me that if you do get something good, you are more likely than not to just lose it and leave you feeling worse than you ever have before.My memories have become a minefield, stepping into any one of them is destructive for me. My brain has become my own personal circle of hell. My good memories have become worse than my than my bad ones",0

"I do not know know if any of you do this but my mind always goes back to the past because modern times is a nightmare. I miss the old world before social media, smart phones, selfies and digital media.The late 90's and some of the early 00's is what I miss the most. Nostalgia is a doubled edged sword though because you can dream about it all you want but know you can never can go back which makes the nostalgia so damn painful it hurts my heart. it is like missing a home you can never go back to and now you are stuck in some horrible neighborhood where everything feels fake and shallow and people around you seem like aliens.

"The past month (if not the past decade) has been a rollercoaster and I feel like I am so on edge and close to going crazy all the time. I might not be as bad as I was a couple weeks ago, but it feels like hell trying to control my brain and stop all the thoughts that are so strong in my head. I have had my mental health assessment appointment cancelled on me that was supposed to be today, so I feel so lost even though I have been actually trying to get help. It feels like no matter what I do, the services that are actually supposed to help me do not even what to know.I cannot believe I am going to turn 26 tomorrow and I feel like shit and like everything in my life has gone back to square one. Why do I even try when so much of this world has gone to shit, or has always been shit? Its my birthday tomorrow",1

"Hi everyone. I am here as a last resort kind of thing, I simply do not know where else to turn. I am thankful that this platform exists, I am not sure if anyone will even read this, but I have reached my capacity and I need help. To the average person you could think my life is pretty normal. I have a home, I have a car, I have a family who cares for me. But I am completely lost in life. I am 23, and when I graduated high school in 2016, I had no idea what to do with my life. My dad, who was my best friend and greatest ally, died unexpectedly of a heart attack in October of 2016. I was not only lost, I was devastated. Still am. My family still is. Anyways, I never thought I had the determination or courage to go to college, so I stayed at my restaurant job I had. I had been there for 6 years, then in May this year, I quit. No two weeks or anything. I was so tired of the same routine that happened there and the toxicity of the place, so I left. I have never thought of myself with any high regard. I do not think I am pretty, or smart, or fun. I have always seen myself as a burden on anyone who comes near me. This has proven to be true time and time again. I had a 3 year relationship with a man I love deeply, but he left me for someone else in November of 2020. He always told me I was crazy, needed help he could not provide, and so on. When that happened, I was fully convinced that I ws better off dead. i knew i did not want to be alone with my intrusive thoughts. but i kept on. kept working. kept trying. i met a few other men after that, all who further proved the fact that i am not worthy of love. All left me. I am now unemployed with rent due at the end of the month. i have a roommate who is counting on me. i tried to make it work at another job, but it became clear after my first week that i was not in a healthy enough mental space to work there. all the friends i have are too busy with their significant others to lend me some help.i feel no hope for myself. this feels like the universe telling me that i am not needed here. i want to live. i want to feel the happiness that i know might be possible for me. but i have no clue how to get there. it feels like i have no guidance. my motivation is constantly outweighed by my doubts and anxiety. i just want to have a place in the world. any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated, and it just might save my life. I have no money, no guidance, and no idea. If you read this, I love you and thank you. Please reach out. Julia Every day feels hopeless",1

Does anyone here know anyone with psoriasis? its driving me crazy I started being shy and self conscious I am middle/high school but I did not have psoriasis which is weird. I started getting psoriasis at like age 16 and I feel like it traumatized me. Going to glass with a hoodie and the teacher telling me to take it off. Just a lot of embarrassment and shame. Not being able to talk to girls and if I would hang out with girls I would go straight to the friend zone on purpose. I have trauma from being toddler too. My mom used to tell me I am just like my biological father and at the time I could not understand but then my step dad came along and that is when I started the pieces together. I feel like Ill never be as smart as him. Over all I have a lot of child hood trauma plus the psoriasis makes it even worse I do not want to meet new people I am venting sorry but does anyone know anyone with psoriasis that got rid of it I feel like getting rid of it will help a lot. will not solve all my problems but at least I can be my self again. I do not know anymore,1

I know that you are supposed to find ways to cope and feel better. My family is helping the best way they can. But it is hard when I considered them my family, my life. My brain just will not let go. I just hate it. They act like getting fed up with me and not being my friend was going to magically stop the depression. I also do not use the internet a lot.

"So my roommate is one of my best friends and has been for some time. Today she told me she feels like she cannot talk to me about things because when I express my annoyance to her about not cleaning up after herself, it hurts her feelings. I can totally understand where she is coming from and I am trying to do better, but its hard. I have been telling her for some time that I expect her to clean up after herself in common areas after a reasonable span of time (several hours to a day). This means cleaning the kitchen after cooking, throwing out old food in the fridge, vacuuming the dining room if the floor is dirty, cleaning up the ash from her bong (she self medicates with weed instead of going on antidepressants and seeking therapy), etc. it just feels like I am the only one making an effort to clean and she only cleans if I ask her to. The problem is, she says that executive functioning like cleaning is extremely difficult for her because she has depression and adhd. I can sympathize with her because I have OCD and mood regulation issues, but I have no trouble keeping the common areas clean and prefer to do so. I just cannot be the only one doing it. I have tried explaining to her that I love living with her, but its just frustrating being the only one who makes an effort to keep things clean. She takes this as me calling her lazy and disgusting, even though I have never called her those things. She has this idea that everyone secretly hates her and will grow tired and abandon her, and me being annoyed at her not cleaning is just a sign this is true. What can I do to make doing household chores easier on her, aside from just doing them for her? I want to continue living with her, but I cannot be her maid. Help with a depressed roommate",0

Since I recovered from the hospital I have had a severe depression. I became obsessed with death the more and more I read about transplants online, the mortality rate, life expectancy, etc, nobody even mentioned any of this to me before I got the transplant. In my country the person who has lived longer with a heart transplant it is been 21 years and is all can think about. I am not a good person and I have drank a lot in the last few years since it was the only thing that helped me forget about everything for some time, right now I just cannot do anything, I just cannot get out of the bed I cannot fake it anymore and smile like I everything is going to be okay. I do not want to go through a transplant again neither die in pain, I just want to die in peace, I wish I would have died in that bed before I took this heart from someone else, it could have been of better use.

I hate going outside because invariably something happens where someone ridicules or thinks I am worthless, and I hate people because I know they think I am worthless and am a loser.

"I used to struggle with suicidal thoughts when I was really heavy, they went away for a bit when I lost all the weight, but now they have returned...The few friends I had stopped hanging out when I quit smoking weed. Thank you Controlled Substances Act for turning me into an alcoholic. I cannot go a week without binge drinking at least twice now, or a couple days without having a few brews, always feeling anxious and shitty the next day. But wait, coke does not show up in a drug test nearly as long, so now I have that demon to battle as well.My moms been sick, she will not tell anyone the specifics, that hurts. My dads fighting with his wife (separated parents), I have not talked to them very much in months because every time I visit they just complain about each other. My stepdads a bigoted piece of shit that has not said more than a few sentences to me since I came out and wants me out of the house. My siblings are busy with their own lives, which I am apparently not a part of anymore.I would pack up and leave too, but all my money is tied up in medical bills, student loans, credit card debt (I am a fucking idiot I know), and a car note. I do not know how I am supposed to save over a grand for a down payment, or who will even take me without spending at least a year at the job first, considering my current employer is booting me out at the end of the week to outsource my position...But hey I lost a couple hundred pounds, so that is cool. Too bad it is severely fucked up my skin leaving me to look like a lumpy potato sack, and corrective surgery is not covered by insurance because it is considered ""cOsMEtiC"". Guess I will just have to live with it. I thought it would make me happy, and sure walking up stairs without getting out of breath is nice, but my dopamine levels have not really changed...I spent 4 years neglecting my social life to rack up debt for a piece of paper. Work and school both full time, too busy to really meet anyone or do anything fun for myself. Not that my social skills are great either, I never knew what having confidence was like when I was a big guy, so I cannot hold a conversation for shit, I just grin like an idiot and sound like a dumb robot, occasionally making some stupid joke or captain obvious type comment. Maybe it will help me find a new job, I do not know anymore, the markets not great for my career field even though I was told it should be. Guess once employers realized they can remotely hire anyone around the world they stopped giving a fuck about the locals. Is what it is I guess. I keep waiting for a call, but none ever come...Thought the added free time would be nice, but without friends there is not much to do. I have spent so much time watching stuff on Netflix and YouTube that I do not even know what else I can search, and video games are dull to me now. Just the same endless gameplay loop for some reward that feels nice to obtain for a few minutes before feeling like the same repetitive shit over again. None of that even feels like fun to me anymore...I would talk to my boyfriend but he is probably sexting with someone else right now. Oh yeah, he drunkenly admitted to that last night. that is going to be a fun conversation for tonight. I do not know how he is he going to react, and honestly, he was the only reason I even wanted to wake up in the mornings anymore. If shit goes south later, I do not think I am going to continue this game anymore, I want out. I have no reason nor will to keep playing anymore... The thoughts are coming back again",1

"i have no idea how to stop constantly thinking about every little thing to myself, especially when I was desperately ready to kill myself. I am not as suicidal as I used to be but I have not had much of an escape to release some of my feelings. recently I have been developing moments very often where I would understand there is something wrong with me but **not understand** what it was that bothering me and making me feel that way. its honestly a terrible reminder and makes me feel like I am digging myself a hole back to where I was rescued from in a way and I am sick of it. its hard to stop thinking to yourself all the time.",1
"I have recently looked into reddit and found that this place is actually quite healthy and supportive... I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

"I think I am done with being alive. My life has been pretty rough since birth. No real need to dive into that. But now I am nearly 30. Nothing has gotten better. No friends, dead end job, cannot get over a relationship that ended 5+ years ago, not close to my family, soon to be homeless bc I do not make enough to afford to live on my own. I really have tried to turn things around. I have hobbies but I just do not care about them anymore. I do not care about my job, and I have 0 skills so there is no way I can find a better one. I have tried meds but I am always berated by doctors and people I look to for help bc they assume I only want drugs? Idk. Plus I am just broke and cannot afford that stuff.

"When I am depressed, which I am right now because of a long term relationship coming to an abrupt end I tend to turn into a methodical robot. I do not know how to act. I know it is a trauma response but it cannot be healthy. it is been one day and I have already made lists of items that need to get done, sort out the logistics of the seperation and contacting my lawyer in regards to paperwork. I do not even know if it is too soon. I do not want to be a cold monster. I do not know how else to cope however. Not with any conflict. I immediately go into survival mode and make checklists of what needs to get done.What is worse? What is better? I do not even feel human right now.

"I enjoy writing and being by myself. I have some projects lined up that should release in the next year or two. I do not expect to become rich, what I hope is that these projects will perform well enough to allow me to quit my job. If not, I think I will live off any remaining savings for a month or so, enjoying final moments, then death.In the United States, apparently none of us have the capability to produce thoughts. If you stand around in silence, people will be bothered by it. Have to always talk and smile. For my entire life, I have been talked to as if I am a complete idiot. To be smart, have to always talk and never think... Tired of being talked down to. Tired of living in such a grossly ignorant country. Tough to find fulfilling work. I like my mind and I like to think and feed my varied curiosity. Writing seems like the only joy to fulfill these desires. Though, I once tried a job that at least provided physical fulfillment: landscaping. Basically get paid to work out in the sun, be surrounded by nature. I applied landscaping maintenance but they ended up placing me on landscape construction, which is currently out of my capabilities due to such immense heavy lifting. Tried telling HR about this, ended spending an hour with two higher-ups telling me that I should not be disruptive. When I had went into the job interview, I told the higher-up that I am a little reluctant, 30 pounds is probably my lifting limit. He responds ""Oh you will just be planting flowers"". A 50 pound slab is quite the flower.Job that I currently do is not horrendous, but four or five constant 12 hour shifts is a bit of a drag. And while it is unintional, having my coworkers talk to me as if I am a complete idiot, just because I am quiet, not an existence I want to keep living. I have lived pretty well, and I have given, and will give a few more shots for a worthwhile life. does not seem to make sense to perform unfullfiling work. Or to live in a country that likes to promote individuality yet will expect everyone to constantly talk. I dread humans",1

"My depression is not actually a disorder. I am just a fundamentally fucked up horrible piece of trash that genuinely was not meant to accomplish anything. This is the universe's way of punishing me. I do not even have 'depression' I am just a weak sensitive pussy that was not meant to make it in this world.Everyone has given up on me because of how much I wallow in my own misery. it is like I do not want to get better. I want to stay exactly where I am and stay in this state because I do not deserve to get better. I bet everyone around me thinks I am a pathetic loser using the term ""depression"" as an excuse as to why I am such a failure. Everybody hates me and most people want nothing to do with me. And do not tell me I am overthinking and it is not the reality but it is true. I have always been a recluse growing up and was never able to connect with people emotionally. I had a small group of friends throughout my childhood but I never actually felt like I fit in with them. I got bullied throughout middle school, high school and even college which traumatized me when it comes to trusting people.I am a very weird creepy person. People have either suggested it or have said it right to my face. I have a weird voice, weird shaped body, a huge head, scrawny. Everyone can sense that there is something not right about me and stay away. I know I am done for emotionally when one or both of my parents passes away. They are the only people I can trust. I have two sisters that are around my age but even they know that I am an embarrassment of a brother that should not have been born.I have been seeing psychiatrists for three years and tried all kinds of medications but nothing has actually worked. I have a lot of turmoil building up inside of me and I am not able to get rid of it.

They expressed they feel sad and worried but the emphasis was to seek out a health professional as soon as possible. And I feel that such response does not even acknowledge any of my feelings why I even feel this way or what has been the triggers and so. There is this new friend of mine who received my note as well and has responded, it is what is, goodbye and I will never forget you. And that just makes me want to kill myself soon.

"I have struggled with depression suicidal thoughts for years now, and my husband knows this. He has been very supportive when I started therapy and medication, and continues to be there for me. However we had a fight and rather than telling me he needed a break from the discussion he just walked away from me (we later discussed it, and he did not want to start yelling, so he chose to remove himself from the situation, communication is a separate thing that we are working on). At a certain point I seriously considered hanging myself from our weight lifting cage. I went so far as to toss a a belt over the chin up bars. I do not really know why I stopped. Maybe realizing that it was not tall enough for the belt, or that I did not know how to secure it properly. From there I just had a series of thoughts about how long it would take for him to come down and check on me, how he would react, what would happen if it failed. So I went back upstairs and told him that I needed help. I do not think he realizes how close I was to going through with it, and I do not know how to approach it. He also struggles with depression, so I do not want to put blame on him. He may have upset me, but I have an illness that does not let me think or process emotions rationally in times of stress. Right now I am thinking about writing a letter so I can get my thoughts ordered, and give it to him, but that feels.. immature? Weak? I do not know, just not right. Advice on how to approach this would be helpful. Side note: My doctor and I agreed to increase my antidepressant dose, and I have an appointment with my therapist scheduled for next week. So, some steps have already been taken to prevent this from happening again. How to talk about how close I was to going through with it my husband",1

"- Number of Mental Breakdowns: 0- Number of Near Mental Breakdowns: 0Thankfully, nothing significant happened today...School is boring though... Entry Log 2: Day 2 (26/07/21)",1
"Sorry for the millionth post of the night, I am just writing for me....people would say I was given a good life, would not they? But I chose to destroy it. Every day I live the exact opposite of how I want. I could change but I just do not. Depression is not an excuse. I am the one who ruined my life over and over and over and over. Me. I am the one who will keep ruining my life forever. Some people never get better and I am one of them. This is how it looks. I am thinking the streets might not be so bad because at least then I wln't have to pay bills. And I might have the comradery of other people who are as sick as me. I cannot exist among normals. I used to have goals and dreams and shit but I realized I do not give two fucks what happens to me in this life. I guess a better person would carpe diem and all that but I am a bad person. I do not exist anymore. I am just depression",0
"I have never behaved like this. I have no clue what is happening to me and I am really scared. My mind is spiraling down to a really dark place and I am beginning to overthink about everything. Nothing makes sense anymore. I am the most useless and boring human being that ever existed on this planet. I feel so fucking isolated from everyone and everything, like I am not even really here, I feel like someone is living my life instead of me. Everyone pretends to care when they really do not give a fuck. How could I trust people when I cannot even trust myself? When I am sabotaging my own happiness and making things worse for myself with my own fucking thoughts. When I promised I would never try to hurt myself again and yet here I am, with a knife in my hand, cuts and bruises all over my body. I feel like I am turning completely fucking insane and idk what to do. Idk how to distract myself, how to make them stop. I just want to stop thinking. I miss being numb. I think I am turning insane",0
"Yeah, I want to live until I am 100. I want to suffer forever, why not. The pain gets worse with age...",0
"I just feel so alone. That stupid because ppl see me as a girl that seems happy, a little introverted maybe but joyful and all. I tried to take some meds because I am so tired of thinking. I just want to stop thinking. Never saw a therapist or a psychiatrist because it is complicated where I live and I do not have the money for it.Rn I am drinking bc I know that if I took a med my mother would notice itI'm just so tired because sometimes it actually get better. Like I do not feel sad, not really happy but not sad and it is so much better than feeling nothing or just infinite sadness. Not going to lie, first I was coming there because I was hopping someone could help me find something that could get me high enough to stop thinking. it is against the rules apparently so yeah instead I am just venting. I do not even know if someone will answer me. I just want to disappear. Still do not know why I am alive. Every year just keep getting worse. But in the same times I meet new people that seems to like me, but each time they leave. Now I am starting to think I am the problem.I wish I could help all the people there, maybe it could give some meaning to my life. But like I said before I did not even come for that, just for myself. I do not even know why I am going to post but I have the impression that it will help me? Anyway, good luck you all. do not know if it will get better but I guess we only have one way to find out, even if it is so hard to stay around. Not a interesting title",0
"I do not feel anything anymore, i can cut my wrist and not even feel it. I see no meaning with my life. People telling me it will get better and that i will not feel like this forever just makes it worse. I am not seeking help here, i do not want people to try to help me no more. This is more like a last goodbye. Thanks to anyone that genuinely cared about how I actually felt. Nothing except suicide can help me anymore. Goodbye. I do not feel anything",0

"hi all,i want to start by saying i have a good support system at the moment and am utilizing all of my resources to push through this. but I have made an observation about myself and my thoughts recently. lately i have not been drinking much. and that is good. but when i do, i indulge. subsequently, i feel painfully depressed for DAYS after. the physical symptoms of my hangovers are bad, but the mental symptoms are much, much worse. i struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts when sober, but have a regimented self care method to manage it. and i manage quite well. so the spiral i feel after one single night of drinking is distressing.i know alcohol is a depressant, and i know that it does not particularly make anyone feel good. but i was wondering if anyone else feels this way after a night of drinking, where you cannot shake suicidal thoughts and feelings for up to a week. my friends are normal in that they obviously feel shitty the day after drinking, but not for multiple days. so I am feeling alone. evidently the solution is to probably stop drinking altogether, but i just wanted to see if anyone else has felt such intensity from a single night of drinking, and if anyone has any advice. from alcohol, to sex, to social media consumption: normal human experiences never feel normal. i either feel things too intensely, or i feel completely numb. i just want to be able to enjoy things normally, and to react to setbacks (like hangovers) in a perceivably normal way. but i cannot. but I am going to keep trying.thank you i just need a place to talk about this",1
"Thinking of it since 3 years now. Need to wrap this up. Humanity is filled with selfish morons who place their beliefs before their reasons. The fact religions are still a thing is one of the many things that shows of lost we are. With global warming and all this shit humanity is dead in less than 50 years.I, personally, have no reason to live. I have no friends since more than a year because I blocked them, because they turned to be just as dumb as the others. I have no motivation to do anything. I am bored studying (19,M). have not drawn in more than a year altho I am studying in an art class (not exactly but you get the idea and I do not have the translation).I do not even know why I post here because you guys are just humans too. And are just like everyone else I hate. I do not search any ""do not do it blabla"" bullshit. Decision has been taken since more than 3 years (haha and ""friends"" did not take it seriously kakskz). I am in France so no fire arms. And I am a pussy.So here is my question : what is the quickest way/easiest way to die? I do not give a fuck if that implies annoying anyone in the process.

How every bit of stress sends me into another panic attack?And then fucking what? THEN WHAT? They tell you how to deal with it, what you mean fucking breathing? Counting back from 10? drawing? Going for a walk? Talking about it?How are any of those things supposed to stop me from killing myself? HOW IS SUPPORT GOING TO STOP THIS?Talking about it does nothing. I still feel everything. It still happens every day. Talking does nothing to stop it.They prescribe you with meds, you still have to go and talk to them. what is the fucking point? Therapists and therapy are all bullshit",0

"Do any of you just that this feeling that, if someone held you for a bit, maybe everything will be okay?I mean like, holding you as you cry and mumble about your troubles. Maybe rubbing your back or patting your head reassuringly. Never discouraging you from your emotions, only letting you and your saddness exist with them. Maybe whispering ""let it out"", or ""its okay"", or even ""it is all going to be okay"", without ever shushing you. Maybe I am just that bad, though, I would be lying if I said I did not find comfort in this pathetic fantasy.God, this just makes me feel more ashamed of my feelings. I have never attempted to yet, but I cannot help feeling like I do not want to exist anymore. Surely, I do not really have a right to complain, when I have never fought the battle, right?Either way, I guess it would just be nice to be with someone who wanted me around. Who maybe was not repulsed by me, at least once.That might help me avoid the inevitable.. at this point. Loneliness really does feel like a slow-acting poison",1

"Hi. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in January this year. I took antidepressants for like 3 months, but then stopped because I did not have it in me to be dilligent about it.At the same time, I started having a crush on a friend of the same major (online school, our cities are 400 km apart). We talk almost every day. Since then, I do not know if these are correlated or not, but I began feeling like I do not need my SSRI anymore.Nowadays, I do not really talk to him again and begin to feel the need of taking antidepressants again to function.Is this valid? Might there be any correlation at all between those two things? This is ridiculous but can having a crush be a substitution to antidepressants?",0

I do not know where to askI've been struggling with suicide thoughts lately (I get professional help so I am okay) Yesterday when I was cleaning my apartment I found an note where I wrote about my suicide thoughts and an suicide letter to it as well. Somehow I got scared when I read it. I know it was my thoughts I wrote and I was in a very dark place when I wrote that. But it scared me somehow. I threw the note away and the letter.

I have no friends because I drive them all away, as I did with my best friend today. I have a disease that is going to kill me one day and I am getting tired of waiting because it is fucking with my brain. I am tired of the pain. I am tired of the cold. I am tired of the darkness. I am tired of the nightmares. I am tired of the sad music. I am tired of being FUCKING TIRED!!! I have nothing left and I am sitting here wanting to just eat a fucking bullet.

And to be honest, it would make hell of a book or a movie script.To tell these stories one day, I must live.I must live to tell little girls, they are not alone. I must live to let go of all these secrets one day.I must live to get the justice I deserve.I must live to sleep without crying one day.I must live to live a life I want.So, next time whenever Ill ask myself why am I alive..Ill know the answer too Why am I alive?

"I am so depressed.The thing is, growing up I had high dreams for myself.Really high dreams.I was lucky in the sense that I was born with talents. I could sing and grew up being praised for my voice. I was a fabulous writer who thrived off books and poetry. As I got into my teen years I began to love fashion. I could have been a singer, or a writer or even a fashion designer.I could have had friends. Fun, hilarious and artistic friends like me. And instead, I became none of those things I so desperately loved. I do not have any friends because I am pretty different and I do not find it easy to click with people that often, especially in the town I ended up living in.I am 31 and I have a daughter who I adore and love more than life itself. But I still cannot help but feel cheated out of the life I felt I knew I was meant to have.When I hear music, sometimes I cry just thinking about how I wanted to do that. If I see a woman thriving in her writing career,Well.. you guessed it!

"First off I am not trans or anything, I was born a man.I am skinny, weak, unathletic, and have a very weak jawline. Pretty much everything that can be weak about a person besides height, I have it. My entire life I have been dominated, physically and/or socially and I am fucking tired of it. I dream about a life where I do not have to take shit because I could kick anyone ass. Looking back throughout my entire life, most of the big problems I had were more or less because of things I could not change. Even the short kids would give me shit because I was weaker than them and was not good socially.I know that the alpha/beta male thing is a myth, but goddamn do I feel beta in most things I do. Even if its fake it sums up pretty well what I have felt my entire life. Before anyone says go to the gym I do. And I do see improvements. But its disheartening seeing people who have never lifted lifting more than me during their first session. I just want to be good at a sport. I played basketball for 7 years and was still worse than all my friends who did not play. Being naturally athletic sucks. I wish I looked more like a man",0

I have lied to almost everyone I know about it. At first, I felt so confident that if I kept trying I would reach my goal, but nothing. The guilt feels like it is overpowering me.

I have gone through most of my life just waiting for something to push me over the edge so that I can finally die. But unfortunately, I am still here. And even worse is that I have done nothing of value or meaning. I have wasted my time and missed out on opportunities with friends.. I have not been living. I have been waiting for death. I feel so useless and empty, that I do not have a goal, or a plan, or anything. I am just kind of floating through life without direction and I do not know how to handle that realization anymore.

"I stood atop a condo balcony to think to myself whether it seemed like something I could mentally go through with, but damn that is scary...

I threw away all my drugs when i became sober though and I am wondering if anyone would know what drug would be the most pleasant to go out with? in the time it would take for me to get it I will have made up my mind one way or another i guess. I have thought about everything I might miss in the future, I wanted to travel everywhere and see as much as i could before my time was up but tbh, my drive has been teetering on empty for a long time now. i could give my miserable life story but i doubt anyone would care for that, I have wallowed in enough self pity I am surprised i have not drowned, or that my heart has not given out. i cannot eat solid foods without gagging, I am sleep deprived, i have nowhere to go, i have no real friends, my gf of 4 years left me for her co-worker, I am an anxious mess. I just realized i said i would not tell my life story but there I go again, poor o'l me. I am scared of death but I do not want to keep on living",1
"TLDR: they got worse but at least plan c is gone Basically I made a post at one point saying I had three separate plans and a whole lotta bad thoughts, so check that first for context.Good news is: plan c is no longer a plan. I cannot interact with people well enough to get a date in the first placeBad news: mostly bad news. The thoughts are still there and boy oh boy are they growing. So during a few meltdowns I have done a real bad thing where I just walk out and go as far away as possible, remembering plan A in the process. Now they have been nagging me to do it more outside of meltdowns - mall, grocery store, park; hell, we got in a car crash a few weeks ago (dw everyone is ok) and I thought to just start walking and hope no one notices. Literally the only thing that stopped me was the cops sowing up to assess the damage. Speaking of plan a, that is also been nagging more. Not much to elaborate there.Another thoughts been growing, the one that I have had it too good. Been noticing my appetites going down cuz I feel like I do not deserve whatever I am eating. More commonly with meltdowns Ill try to get rid of clothes, jewelry, phone, etc thinking only good kids get to have it. I hardly even want to go anywhere anymore cuz all the fun places are good kid things and I should not have that. Even the bed I am laying in while typing feels wrong to sleep in.I have lorazepam in case they get too bad but I always refused and threatened to take the whole bottle, and now I am legit afraid to take it in case I decide to go through with it 2am update on the thoughts and plans",1

"Really need help here, I have struggled with feeling this way for weeks now.For the past month or so I have had little to no motivation to do anything anymore. Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall. I HATE living with my father, who is even more depressed/lonely/pathetic/miserable than I am. he is an incredibly toxic person to be around, and I know once I am gone and away from him I will begin to feel better.I do not know anyone where I live. I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore. Everything is a chore and requires a tremendous amount of effort to do.I just want to feel productive again, but I am not sure what to do. I do not want to waste the remainder of my summer doing nothing.Has anyone felt the same way? What did you do to resolve this? Thanks for your help! No Motivation, No Desire, Please Help",0
"I have read so many peoples experience on Reddit with depression and it always makes me feel whole again. Like oh that is it! This person was just lacking self esteem! that is my problem too, If I study the six pillars Ill be back to normal. So I do and for a day or two I feel great. But the cycle always seems to start again. I am not even sure if its depression, but I sure feel different these days. I am 18 and when I was sixteen I felt so on top of everything, even looking back at texts I was smart funny, clever and arrogant . I had hobbies and never avoided people. Now I am isolated and anxious around friends and coworkers. Constantly thinking how to say things, what tone to use, is this an appropriate answer to this persons question and incredibly frustrated at my lack of real connection with anybody. Even my cognitive function I feel has gotten weaker, like a bon fire that has simmered down To a candle light. I started blaming the isolation with my family and now I think it was marijuana use. I hate going to my retail job, my mind blanks so often in conversation and worst of all my boss is a nice to me for the wrong reasons. He thinks I have a learning disability. My questions s where do I get help? And does anyone think I needs medication, I am fighting my dad because he does not think I need any meds and that I just have low self esteem? I think hes right about the self esteem , but maybe there is more problems like adhd or depression? Confused and frustrated needed to rant.",0
"When you feel depressed, or know that you are, you cannot help it. You cannot help yourself from feeling a certain way. It changes the way you think, the way you act. When you are depressed, people do not usually treat you with much compassion or understanding. They do, however, become sympathetic when you die by suicide. that is how it is. Once you take your life, people start to post your photos with captioned stories of how amazing you were when you were alive and how much they will miss you. The sad truth is, the same people who do this are the same people who saw you at your lowest and ignored it. I have been having a difficult time to feel constant happiness. I have been having suicide thoughts for a long time. I just do not want to live anymore. There are times that I have tried but to be honest, during the times that I tried I guess I always knew that it was not going to kill me I guess it was a call for help? But what if it actually does kill me. What if I went to far and actually end up dying.. Its not even the fact that I could die that scares my but what does is not knowing what happens after. What happens after I die? do I really go to hell for killing myself? Will i just be a ghost roaming around earth? Will I have another life? Will nothing happen and Ill just cease to exist? What if nobody cares that I am gone? What if things will get better one day and I would not know since I killed myself? At this point I do not think its a question of whether or not ill kill myself but rather its a question of when I am going to kill myself. I know that things eventually get better but fucking shit its taking a hella long time. Thoughts",1
"I am sorry to everyone that I have hurt by doing this. I cannot take it anymore, every day just blends into the next with this looming sense of I am just wasting my fucking life and this voice inside me constantly putting me down. Everywhere I go and have been I have been surrounded by wonderful, supportive people and yet I have never felt more alone during those moments. In these 23 years of life I have spent the past 9 just wishing and waiting for the sweet embrace of death. I just want to no longer feel alienated from the world, a robot operating a meat machine, completely devoid of purpose and emotion just living each day like clockwork. A feeling reminiscent of being a background character in a movie while the protagonists continue on their grand adventure. There honestly is no point in continuing on at this point because I cannot stand another day of If you kill yourself now then you will not get to see what the future holds! I have seen my future and there is no happy ending for myself, just images of my cold lifeless body hanging from a rafter somewhere or floating down a river, the next John Doe to be discovered by a passerby and just another statistic. So to all who saw some glimmer of potential in me or somehow found the strength to love me. Thank you, I love you and please keep continuing to spread good into this world. But there is nothing that will fix this broken soul. Goodbye",0
My parents admitted me to a hospital because they assumed I was going through a nervous breakdown. I had to stay there for a week and it was hell. My stay at the hospital triggered a psychotic episode. They would pin me down and give me an injection in my buttcheek. They saw me naked and they were also physically aggressive. The body language of the male staff was very threatening and triggered a lot of paranoia in me. They also gave me so many pills. I feel like my brain has become mush now. I genuinely do not want to live anymore I lost any positive trait I had left. I have been crying non stop now. I feel like I am doomed for eternity and there is nothing left for me in this world. I feel like the only good trait I had was my intelligence but now it is gone due to all the drugs I was given. I have not even graduated high school yet My stay at a hospital made me worse,0
"I have been feeling so shitty for over a year now, I get suicidal thoughts everyday yet I am such a pussy. I have been struggling a lot with my gender and sexuality. I fucking hate school and I am starting college soon and I just know I cannot handle it. My parents are always on my back, I got really drunk one night and came out to my mum as bigender, I do not really know if I am but at the time it felt right, she freaked out and the next day both my parents were in my room screaming at me. My parents are divorced and I explicitly told my mum not to tell my dad. We do not get on and never have.They then got me tested for autism as apparently gender identity issues and autism are linked, regardless if they are got diagnosed but apparently I am really high functioning so it should not affect me much in life, they then blamed it all on that and we never spoke about it again. I am also pansexual but that last coming out ordeal has taught me my parents are not trustworthy or very supportive so fuck coming out again. I have been self harming for about 2 months now, I do not know wot it is about it but its the only time I feel anything. I have also been wanting to try girls clothes, I was born a guy and I have got no idea about my gender anymore but I know that I do like girls clothes however I have no way to get any, and my parents would definitely kick me out if I started wearing them. My friends are pretty supportive but i know they just do not get me, I do not blame them I do not either, it makes me feel so alone. The one positive as of late tho happened the other day when I was coming home from being out with my friends, I decided to run home instead of getting the bus, it was pitch black and I was just blasting my music and it actually felt pretty good. Anyway this was more of a rant I just really do not know wot tf to do I do not even know what to do anymore",1
"I am so tired of trying to spread myself thin and make sure everyone is alright when I feel like inside I am fucking screaming for help myself!!!!! I just wish people would realise I need a break too and leave me the fuck alone!!!!!The folk i want to be around me leave me and the ones I do not want hang around like a bad smell bringing me further and further down and I just cannot bare this shit anymore. I just want someone to cuddle me and tell me shit is going to be alright, instead of push me away because I am no ones priority! Heart broken!!!",0
"So yeah, I do not know any of you but, I feel like i got to tell someone at least. I lost my best friend recently due to a miscommunication, and I really do not have anyone else. I have a family, but ever since I came out as trans, things have been rocky. I am not very scared anymore about ending it all, feels nice thinking about it. I lost my job due to covid, still been trying to finda notehr one ever sicne, I have had chronic headaches that would not go away unless i took 6 aspirins a day. I know I am not perfect, and putting everyone and everything above meis annoying and discouraging for others. I am 30 y/o andI have nothing to look forward to, never had. Finally going through with it after years of thinking about it",1
"I have felt this way for so long I have always assumed it was normal- not so much that I was necessarily sad, but more often just numb? Like I never really feel joy or excitement, although occasionally (I distinctly remember the occasions) I have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. I am not sure if this depression, and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. I think I am having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled, or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events (previous abuse, climate change, corruption, realizing you likely will not grow up to be what you thought you would be, the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc), or if that is a distinction that even matters? Depressed?",0
"after a lot of therapy, there is no help for people like me, people with my problemsYou have painful emotions? The answer is therapy. You tell a therapist what would help, and they tell you that is not what therapy is for. OK, then what is the profession that will give me that help called? Oh, that does not exist. But, also, still do not kill yourself, no matter how much you are suffering. Also, I will not do anything to help you not suffer.Then they tell me to just stop being a human, stop finding enjoyment in what is well established as what people enjoy. See the research on happiness. The only ""help"" therapy offers is to tell me ""you should not kill yourself even if you do not get what you want."" OK??? So you will apply that to yourself too, and keep giving me therapy if I stop paying you? No? Then why should not I exit my life early, just like you would exit the therapy relationship, when it stops working? The default option is suicide, your job is to present me with a better option, but you will not do your job.that is basically my experience with therapy.Edit: do not tell me to call a suicide hotline, they will not help me either, I already tried that. I am actually blocked from the crisis text number that reddit sends in their automated messages. If you report me, and I try to contact them, they will tell me I have ""abused their system"" and no messages will go through. So do not even bother. post deleted from r/talktherapy, they told me to go here",1
I do not think the life I have is worth fighting for. The only thing that is keeping me from ending myself is the pain factor of death.I am just waiting for the pain and agony in my life to be greater than the fear of pain of dying and I will be happy to do it.I will not bore you with my life story and please do not tell me I matter. I know you mean well and probably really mean it as well but I do not believe someone you have not even known for a minute matters. The truth is no one would care if I dropped dead tomorrow. Sure my mum and sister would be sad but they will get over it. And I am not some sad troubled soul. I am weak and pathetic beacuse I cannot even get through simple life which other people seem to be doing fine at.As I said before it is just not worth it. I am just waiting for the day the pain irl to get so bad that the pain of killing myself would not scare me that much. I am 18 and I just do not think it is worth it anymore.,0
"Lots of things have been building up recently and are making me feel like shit. I struggle to cry properly, I do not know what it is I just cannot.

So how can I release and feel better in a healthy way? How do i release sadness in a healthy way",0
"Today is the death anniversary for my nephew. We lost him to a tragic drowning accident 9 years ago. He was two when he passed away and I was the only one in my family that ever got to meet him and be with him. I helped my sister raise him for the first few months of his life. it is hits me soo hard every single year. It never gets easy. Usually around this fine I have mt bestest friend that I have known since I was 18, would be here to talk with me and keep mt head sane. Sadly it is been 2 year on the 20th that I also lost her to a tragic health condition that stole her away. Last year I ended up coming off the deep end, being the first year I did not have her to be the ground I needed. This year does not feel much different. All I want to do is see his face again and hear her voice. I do not want to break down, I do not want this year to be like every other year but I already have not slept in days. All I can think about is all the people I have lost and how I need them now more than ever. I just want them back. This is the week I struggle the most.",0

"where do i even start?well first of all my crush basically used me bc she knew she did not want a relationship but thought she should fool around with me to see if she did. then decided to tell my bestfriend that she still wanted to do that. so then my friend decided to tell me while we were out partying. that is prolly where the frustration stems but then... my dad decides to finally tell me that we are leaving for washington dc on saturday for 6 days. which ik sounds bad to be upset about but i have my reasons.... 1 i just got back from a 8 day trip for a student led organization and it was a very challenging experience for me and i just wanted to be at home for a bit bc i went with literally no one i know. 2 he did not communicate this to anyone....(my parents are divorced) my mom did not even know, and the issue is i have been at his house for most of the week and if i would have known i would have gone over to her house for more days this week (we do not have a schedule at all) 3 i am a very anxious person...i like to be able to know about my trips so i can pack...i like trips on a whim but they have to be shorter...not 6 days. and with the short notice i did not have time to plan at all. the other thing that is not going well is i have noticed my depression again. i have just lost all interest in life. i just want to lay in bed all day and feel nothing. i have even thought about cutting myself again....i just do not have anything right now everyone is just treating me like shit....and i want to cry about it but i cannot. (also i have seen that i have been spilling water a lot lately which is annoying because i know the universe is trying to tell me to get all my emotions out but i do not want to.) &amp;#x200B;BASICALLY FUCK EVERYONE. i am very mad rn and i do not know why.",0

this is about my ex girlfriend. i broke up with her two days ago because things with our relationship just were not working out anymore and it was starting to become a little toxic and damaging my mental health. but she is suicidal. we were long distance. she lives in the uk and i live in the us and I am worried because there is not much i can do to help for that reason. i still care about her more than anything and i would not be able to live the rest of my life if she did commit. us being broken up just gives her more of a reason to do it because i was all she had. are you able to still call the police in the uk if you are in the us? and will it be on the bill? or maybe there is something i can fill out online if so please send links or something i need to help her i need some help,1

All I do is consume I cannot create anything. I have no skills. I have no money to go to school. I have no support structure. there is so many more people more deserving and more valuable then me.

"How do you live with depression? Even more so, how do you live with depression as an empath? How do you manage to wake in the morn and pull yourself from the comfort of nothingness?

How do you find the courage to keep one foot in front of the other, albeit I bet, with head down...how do you love someone so fucking much, when all you want to do is not be here anymore. Hypocrisy?

"Warning: this is long. I am basically describing all my problems. I am 23. I am supposed to have finished my first year at this really good law school. I have told everyone that I am. Instead, I have actually been a graduate student with my masters in legal science at a less reputed college near me, while actually applying now. I have lied to everyone. I left my hometown to go to law school. I moved into an apartment with my high school/college bestie. She works a LOT as an engineer. Moving in with her was a great idea, I do not regret it and I still love her. she is a good roommate, but honestly she just talks a LOT about herself and her life, I feel like she never asks me. I am also very good at deflecting but I wish she would push a little harder to ask how I am. So I tend to avoid her and chill in my room a lot. I also need time to relax. I also smoke weed almost every day and lie about it. I have a vaping problem that is so hard to quit but I am trying. I lost my gramps earlier this year and its been difficult because he was my favorite man on this planet.I was diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder, bordering depression. Was also prescribed medication I never kept up with. I was going to my psychiatrist then she moved to a different clinic that did not take my insurance. Its been like 6 months since and I still have not gone to another. here is the issue that I think triggered me to become the asshole. My cousin had this graduation extravaganza party. I did a lot, I worked a lot, I fucking cleaned up vomit and managed t o send 30 teenagers home after 1am and ubers were closed. I worked my ass off and just never felt appreciated through the whole moment. Even worse I feel like I annoyed everyone. So, it triggered me real bad and I pushed away everyone. Now I am stuck with no one I can talk to. I have some really good friends I just completely stopped talking to. By the time I realized Id pushed everyone away and stopped talking, I could not figure out how to respond and they all STILL to this day have been trying to get me to talk to them. But a group of friends (two of whom I stopped talking to and the rest people I was t close with) and I had planned a trip months ago. The hotel reservation was under my name and I had a discount. If I did not go, they would not be able to stay there. So I went, felt like everyone hated me the whole trip. The last day was super bad and I cried many times secretly through the day in the bathrooms lmao. Then, I got super wasted and cried for hours in front of 3 of them. No one cared to really talk to me because we had a 9 hour drive that day. So, right before that trip I was ready to apologize to all my friends. Then the trip happened and I no longer really want to talk to anyone. I am not suicidal, I just do not want to live. The only reason I am still on this planet is my mom. I could never kill myself because I cannot fail her. But I imagine myself dying or getting cancer all the time. I do not want to do anything, I have lost passion is everything. I know I am for real depressed. I lie about EVERYTHING because I do not want anyone to think negatively about me bc I already have severe body image issues and I cannot stand to let others thinks there is more wrong with me besides the fact that I am clinically obese. I push everything off. I am pretty sure I have a rotting tooth that could probably get infected and kill me at any time but I have not gone to the dentist because I do not have the energy and now I am scared and also I do not want to. I need to know if I am an asshole to my friends but also advice on how to get out of this rut. In the last 3 days, I have not been smoking, I have not been vaping. I go to coffee shops and work super hard on my applications (also helps that I have some left over ADHD meds.) I finally started to feel some hope and light. My diet is good I no longer binge eat like I used to everyday. I also go the gym like 3 times a week. Something feels different this time but I need any and all advice on how to forward with all my problems. Loser and asshole and sad",1

"It feels like everything is just a blur now. it is there and then it is gone like it is nothing. It feels never-ending and way too short at the same time. I have not felt like this until the last 2 years. I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, but it is never been this bad. It really sucks cus I feel like I cannot truly appreciate the time I have with others. I have been suffering for a long time. I have honestly given up at this point, and the only reason I still try to push myself and progress is for other people. I know I need to love myself and treat myself better, I am trying, really. I have been trying, but I have never tried so hard in my life. it is so hard. I only ever talk to 4 people, which I do not have a problem with at all, but despite having these people in my life, I feel so alone in this world. Not the sense of loneliness in my room late at night, or loneliness from lack of love or affection, but just this lonely feeling. I feel so much pain and yet I feel nothing at the same time. I do not know what to do, and I do not know why I am posting this really. I have been trying to keep it to myself. When it gets bad I hold the gun in my hand, look at it, and just think. I do not know exactly what I am thinking in those moments, there is so much running through my head. I wonder, if there was no one on this earth I loved or cared for, would I be able to do it? There are so many beautiful things in life but this dark cloud takes over and distorts my vision, almost literally. It feels like it controls all of my body. I am not sure how to explain it.

"We broke up. She was my first and will be my last. Never went into relationship before because I knew how much I would fall for the person. I know compromises in a relationship should be for all the good causes of our personal wellbeings. I do not think I am any good but I always encouraged her to be better than me personally, academically and pure from the influence of drugs, booze and people with negative energy and maintain a better social media hygiene etc. Despite all the hurtful things I have endured, all I wanted in return were to influence me in a positive way for me to give up smoking, control myself when got cranky at times etc. so that it becomes a two way street. She meant the world to me. The world where great things would happen. We made so many memories and planned our future together. But in the end I lost her, lost my world and I have nothing left. No reason for me to stay in the world anymore",1

Maybe if I had spoken up a few years ago then maybe I would not have had to have gone through puberty but no, testosterone has destroyed and ruined my body, and I can never change that I will always look like an ugly man to people no matter how hard I try, I cannot deal with this anymore I am killing myself, hopefully within the next few months or sooner, because I cannot live like this anymore I am an ugly stupid failure",1

"tw: suicidal thoughts and drug usea couple nights ago, i was on lsd just to have a bit of an exploration and have some fun. my trip was fine for the most part but towards the end of the night, I was just lying in bed, face down into my pillow, and my mind made me feel as if I was dying. it was as if i was given a choice to just pass away and in the (seemingly) final moments, i thought about loved ones and people who loved me and all the happy and good things i had going in life. despite the fact that i knew i had so much to live for, i chose to let go. i think i just went to sleep so i woke up a couple minutes after. instead of feeling relieved that i did not die, i was extremely overwhelmed by the fact that i had chosen to willingly let go, and also by the fact that i did not actually pass away. i just cried for awhile, for multiple reasons. i feel guilty for what happened but i also feel a range of other emotions. i know what i need to do (seek help again) and i wanted to tell my bf and close friends about this but i just could not bear the thought of worrying them about what happened so i came here to vent a bit. tldr; used lsd and confronted the severity of the suicidal thoughts periodically come and go need to vent a bit/hear some thoughts",0

"Just reread this post and it is a little over the place, but it is late and I want to go to sleep so I will just post it like this.Even as a little kid I did not have interests. My mom used to get me to try different hobbies but I did not like any of them. Maybe that was an early sign of what was to come.it is sad to see someone as young as me not doing anything other than going to school and to the gym. By the way, I have not seen any progress in my body for years now despite lifting often, I just cannot bring myself to eat 3000 calories a day because I do not have discipline. I have only gotten physically stronger, so I guess I am the skinny guy lifting comically high weight at the gym. And while I am lifting, I am thinking of how I do not enjoy doing it.I just do not feel joy from doing anything. I have not been happy since I was a child, and even then I had my dark times. it is a shame, my parents have spent a lot of time, effort and money on me. So far, I have managed to stay alive for them.let us talk about friends, shall we? I do not have many.I live in a small city of around 150000 people. It seems like everybody knows each other except for me. Every time I go out with the little friends I have (who are, I believe, catching on to the fact that I only like hanging out when there is alcohol involved) they greet so many people, and I am the dumbass that is just standing there being sad.I do want to get better, but I am in 4th year of secondary school (11th grade) and I think it may be too late to start building a personality. I am just a she will without interests or hobbies. I guess I can be kind of funny when I am drunk, so that is why my friends keep me around.I am the only virgin in my friend group, which can get horribly depressing sometimes. I play it as a byproduct of being gay in a small city, but it is really just because I have no social skills and I do not enjoy being alive. I have never had any hobbies or interests. I know no one outside of school. How do I build a personality?",0
You have all of eternity to not exist. So exist for as long as you can. If you die from other causes besides suicide its the same. Your gone for eternity. Why rush to it? I understand that your life can be horrible and unfair. You are not your family and you are not your situation. there is a chemical imbalance in your head telling you you want to die. I have experienced mental pain and its horrific how your own mind can try to convince you to die. You are your own person regardless of where your from and who you came from. This experience we call life is fascinating and exciting. Just take a moment to feel your body and your breathing. We are the only animal to realize what death is. Its ceasing to exist in this reality. Regardless of what your life entails its amazing that we get to see what the universe has created and experience it for good or bad. do not off yourself.,1
"I am sorry I cannot be there in person to help, and I am not sure if I would know how if I could. I just wish I could absorb the pain of others for a while so they could have a break and so you could relax for a while. I am sorry life is unfair and people get dealt very unequal hands. I do not know how to help but I really wish I could. Anyway, I do not know you, but you matter to me. Hey if you are struggling out there, just know I am thinking about you.",1
"I have tried therapy, meds, and even removing toxic people, but its only downhill from here. So why September 24th? On September 25th my 10 year class reunion is going down as well as my induction into my schools hall of fame. there is this sick part of me that likes to imagine how everyone will respond. Knowing they could have saved me makes it that much better. September 24th will be my last day on earth.",1

My mind and body is overwhelmed with everything and it wants to end it all. I have tried almost everything that the internet told me to. I have exercised, made a journal, followed a balanced diet, slept early. Yet those things only distracted me from the sadness of life. I was not happier, I was just caught up with the things that distracted me, and in the end, it overwhelmed me. How do you guys do it",0

I am feeling probably the most suicidal I have ever felt and i need someone to talk to can anyone talk right now?,1

I am so numb even after trying to explain my feelings I get told I understand you and that is it. I am so broken Help,1
"I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time ""it will be fine, you can talk to me!"". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ ""friends"" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end, there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this, odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself. I only ever needed comfort, not cops",1
Does anyone else have situational depression? I have been homesick for years and my wife will not allow us to mive back to our homestate where all of our family is. We have a 7 year old daughter who is not growing up with any family surrounding her. The homesick turned into depression so i went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with situational depression with no real cure for it other than to somehow move back home.Anyone else share a similar situation? Situational Depression,0
"I have just last week started a new job, after being signed off sick for 2 years. Its been really hard so far, i had a panic attack on the drive in last week, and this week i just feel unwell mentally a lot of the time.I really do not want to quit, because i feel if i do, that is it for me, I have tried and failed too many times.But i keep feeling like i want to hurt myself so i do not have to go in, not like to kill myself. But stuff like crashing my car, punching a wall and breaking a bone, or just something so i have an excuse. I have avoided it so far, but there is just such a loud voice in my head telling me i should and that i should just give up on a job, or anything in life. I have spoke to my doctor and therapist and its not been that helpful. I just do not know what to do really. Wanting to hurt myself to avoid work",0
"Trigger warning: possible sexual abuse Last year I was having dreams and thoughts that I molested my little sister. When I was around 5/6 yo a boy the same age as me made me rub my p3nis against his and kissed me with tongues. Was this abuse? Or is it normal sexual development? Also I remember kissing my little sister on the mouth and calling her my gf when I was around the same age. (5/6, she was around 3/4)I also remember lying next to her on the bed when we both had no clothes on. Around the same age. I did not touch her and it was only these two incidents (that I can remember anyway). Are these things normal or are the abuse? Should I feel bad about it? Is it just my depression / anxiety trying to convince me that something I did was worse than it actually was? I feel like a monster sometimes and other times I feel like its admissible because I was a kid? Idk just very confused about the whole situation Have I done anything wrong?",0
"I am going to pull away. Act like everything is fine. I am not going to talk to anyone, I am going to be in my own bubble until they stop asking. Then Ill leave them to their lives.they will all forget, quickly. Ill wait until my last commitment is seen through then take the step I am meant for, ending it away from home so my mom will not have to see. she will move on, she will be free of having me as a burden. Everyone else would not bat an eye. I am already close to gone to them.I will die forgotten by all. I cannot see past 25 anyways. Ill be fulfilling my duty to this dump of a planet that will only get worse as time goes on. Me not being here is my gift to all. After all, if I cannot see me getting my simple joys in life, what is to keep me motivated to stick around? Every climb up and only made me fall further into the hole.I want them to keep going without me, to know Ill fade away from memory in an instant. Is that so bad? Is it so bad to want to be forgotten?",0

"I am 19M, almost 20. I have never dated anyone, never had my first kiss, and avoided all of the main high school social events such as prom and parties because I thought I was physically inferior to everyone else. It is worth noting that I have attempted to date, but have been rejected and hurt every single time I have tried. I still do and it has put me into a horrible depressive state emotionally. I do not have many friends and when I see all the people at work who do and who have many people who they talk to on Snapchat and stuff, it makes me hate myself and my life even more. I do not understand how they get all those people to talk to on Snapchat and where they get the confidence to even ask for someone is Snapchat unless they are like best friends or family. Asking for someone is Snapchat or Instagram may be something super simple for everything else but for me, it requires days, sometimes weeks of planning and going over every single scenario where I could casually ask someone for it without it being random and weird. I find myself, my face especially, utterly repulsive and ugly. For instance, for my employment I am a manager and I work with high schoolers. The girls there like to take pictures of us (the managers) for some reason. I ask them why and they say because it is ""funny."" My work environment is really relaxed and we like to have fun while at work. So this is why this is acceptable to every other manager. But I tell them that I do not want my picture taken, and they keep trying to do it. I do not tell them why, but my I tell them not to because I feel really ugly and I just hate the way I look and I believe that they do too. I am in therapy but it is not working and I feel like my mind cannot be changed. I want it to be changed but it feels like I cannot and that I will feel like this forever. I have no idea what to do or where to turn from here. Thanks for your advice in advance. How do I get out of this self degrading mindset?",0
"I do not know what to do. I think I will make it another few months. I have a few goals that I want to reach by the time I am 32 (new place, goal weight and shape, few adventures) I am going to do everything I can to make my goals happen. I going to make it the best year that I can so that on my next birthday my choice will be clear. Maybe this is my last year that I will be here. Maybe this is the start to something amazing. I honestly do not know. I love everyone in my life and I do not want them to be sad, but if things do not work out I cannot stay. it is stupid, but I do not want to grow old alone, I know I joke about being the crazy old guy in the woods but I do not want that. I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids (whether they are ours or adopted) grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100% or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you. I feel like my chances are all but gone and I do not want to be here if they are. Whenever I hang out with my friends I feel like the creepy old guy. I feel like I am intruding on the fun that everyone is having and they keep me around because they feel bad. I have become socially awkward, I cannot keep eye contact with people like I used to. I do not want to feel like this anymore. Idk if I am legit autistic or I have some sort of developmental issue in my brain because I have always had friends younger than me and maybe I am stupid or something and my brain is stunted so I cannot relate to people my age. I do not want to live a life where I am the dude always tagging along to friends events or camping trips alone. I feel broken. I know something is wrong with me and I do not know if I can fix it. Idk even how I was able to to trick my ex into being with me but I know why she cheated. It was me. I was not a good husband even though I tried and I do not think I will ever get another chance. I do not want to die alone but I think I might have to and it is better to do it earlier rather than waiting around till I am 35 or 40. it will give people time to forget about me. This is all stupid as fuck. It all comes down to being alone and my brain not being able to handle it. Maybe I am being punished for the horrible shit I have done, whether it is a God, or the universe or something else I really do not know. I just know I will not let myself live alone forever Opened up to a friend tonight. I am not okay and she knows that an is encouraging me to tell another friend so they can both help. I am trying to get better but my brain is telling me I am being manipulative and to just end it anyway. I only have a few friends my own age most are younger by 5 years",1
"I am 16 and I have had a horrible life so far (never had a friend, homeschooled until 14, not seriously poor but definitely poor-er than 80% of my peers). I had early access to the internet so I was not unaware of real life, I have just felt like an adult from maybe age 8 since my parents always involved me in all adult dramas and problems. My mom is chronically ill and bipolar (except not manic-depressive, more like calm-rage). My dad is an emotionally dead husk. My parents have never let me go out on my own except for my internship this summer, like literally i never saw someone my own age until I was 14. They will not let me work, will not let me do anything for myself (will not even let me make my own lunch). it is fucking insane. I have tried killing myself a couple times but it did not work. But I was a little bitch and did not make a real effort, i tried to strangle myself but it did not work. I usually just try to bury myself in reading or watching something, and lately I have been reading a lot of science fiction which just makes me feel horrible. My life is so boring and I get zero independence, I am a nerd who likes things nobody else i know likes (case in point: SCP Foundation). SciFi is horrible because I will be just enjoying an SCP video and it will end and lo and behold, a fat (not morbidly but somewhat) loser sitting in his room staring into a screen, with three windows: YouTube, Google docs for my internship, and CS:GO which I will play for 15 minutes, rage to the point at which I have literally either cried or punched a wall because I suck at that too like everything else, quit CSGO for an hour, watch an SCP video, do sub-par work, play csgo, restart the Ouroboring cycle. Life is just so boring. I am going to be honest, i enjoyed watching the Ww3 scare last year, watching the capitol siege. Even when it is horrible things nobody wants it feels good just to see something interesting happen for me. But 99% of days I will read my stupid nerd shit and go look at Twitter only to see the trends filled with stupid boring shit everyone likes except me. 16 years old... Reading fiction makes it worse",1

"I am not vegan at all but I have been thinking about this for a while, how we just eat other creatures. Imagine if aliens came to earth and were absolutely horrified to see us all eating each other with 0 thought or remorse, and despite not even needing to. We seriously measure an animals worth by how intelligent they are and we think were better than them and worthy of killing and eating them because we were born more intelligent. If I suggested eating a human people would be disgusted but I do not understand how its any different. If a cow or a pig is food then that means were also just food. The reality is that there is 0 difference. The only difference is the lack of empathy we have for animals compared to other humans because were selfish and ignorant as fuck as long as it benefits us. Were destroying the planet and killing off many species and we still continue to think we are the best because were somewhat intelligent. If there was an animal bigger and more intelligant than us, and they wanted to eat us, we would not like that. We would beg them for mercy and that is what these animals would do to but they cannot speak for themselves and literally do not know any better. But we sentence millions of animals to that when they are just existing and trying to enjoy life.I just think there is a lot about the world that is so fucked up but nobody sees it.

"When I was a little kid I thought life was all about fun and excitement. As I got older I slowly came to the realization that modern life is mostly just a boring and mindless rat race. The majority of people spend most of their time working and doing a bunch of boring shit just to get by. If this is what existence as a conscious being is all about, then I would rather just put a bullet in my head. I hate the idea of being stuck in the monotonous cycle of modern life. I would rather just skip to the end.",1
"So i first posted here back when i was 19, and a few years and a pandemic later here I am, 22 years old and tbh still struggling with a lot. I do not lash out anymore or self harm or really abuse alcohol or drugs or various other things to feel something like I used to, but if i was an emotional wreck back then I am now an emotionless one. The sometimes overwhelming and always constant feelings of loneliness never left me but that is about all I feel nowadays, and even though I used to do some fucked up shit I still felt something, whether it be pain or sadness or a whole range of emotions. Now i just feel empty, and when I decided to change my life and take me off a path which was inevitably leading to suicide, I sure did not think this is where Id be today. My insecurities about being alone and having no one who cares whether it be family or friends have grown massively to the point where I have sorta just accepted that this is how its going to be. In a post I wrote back then I said i was afraid of eventually pushing everyone away, now I am afraid they are just gunna leave. People who know me see me as being better because I am no longer the guy who would get black out drunk and end up hurting himself or the ones around him, but tbh I have not sorted my issues out at all, I am just better at hiding them even better than before. Its not that I want to die, trust me I have been there and I know i never want to go back to that, but I do not want to feel like this but the thing I have no idea what to do. Back at the start I had clear issues which I could deal with better (e.g do not abuse alcohol at every opportunity), but now I have more different issues which are just as painful and make me just as sad. I know I am just in my own head and its not real but honestly I do not even know anymore. I think I am pretty good at picking up on things and that coupled with my fucked up thoughts all in my head create scenarios and illusions, but it gets harder and harder to tell what is real and what is not, and so ultimately I guess I have been through so much pain and hurt that i just automatically have accepted I am alone and no one truly cares about me just to end that suffering, and it just sucks a lot. Sometimes i wonder if life was better back when i was too fucked up and unstable to care about who loves me or whatever, because I did not plan on living much longer, or if I actually successfully killed myself, then none of this would matter. But suicide is not an option and its not like i do not want to feel better and feel loved but i do not see any light at the end of this tunnel just empty, lonely darkness. Lost Soul",1
"For years I have been struggling with constantly feeling sad and never feeling like enough. I have never reached out for any help but I have talked to close friends and my bf about these feelings. Before the pandemic I was feeling slightly better, but something else replaced the constant sadness I used to feel. Now I feel like I am never doing enough; not quite sad but just empty. This summer I have been feeling extremely lazy. I have so much free time I must be using it to find a way to make money. My bf started a new job, all of my friends are employed full time. But me? I am sitting doing nothing. Everyday feels like time wasted. I have talked to my bf about these feelings and he says its ok for me to relax, that its healthy. But I cannot help feeling lazy! I have so many ideas yet I can hardly wake up before noon. Summer is honestly the worst time of year for me. Summer makes me lazy",0
"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why",0
"Every morning I wake up an hour before my alarm and toss and turn dreading the day of work to come. I get to work and almost cry some mornings wishing I was anywhere else. Sometimes I feel ok most times I feel like crap. My brain is constantly running and I always feel tired even though I sleep fairly well. When work is over my thoughts instantly go to my next shift and the dread starts over. I lie in bed all day thinking about the job I have to do the next day. My job is not exactly stressful or that bad honestly. There is some manual labor and I stay busy there. I enjoyed it for the first year or so but now every task I am given feels like an overwhelming obstacle. I constantly worry about making mistakes and screwing something up. I have been told numerous times by my bosses and coworkers That I do a great job but I just cannot shake these thoughts. I recently started lexapro 5 mg and it feels like its making it worse so far. I also binge drink heavily on the weekends and I believe that is part of my anxiety too.I have not been eating as much as I used to. I just want to be able to function again, I was fine for so long and all of the sudden a few months ago I started to spiral. I wish I could find a way to fix this. I cannot shut my brain off.",0
25 years old with literally nobody in my life. I keep cutting social ties because of anxiety and depression. Ill probably waste my entire youth away to my mental health. Ill never have a girlfriend or a best friend to do things with. At least I have myself I am severely depressed and alone,0
"This is a a vent. I (29M) really do not know what I am looking for here other than I have nowhere to release the negative energy actively drowning my brain. I am so lost. Heartbroken. Exhausted.I have been in therapy for years and I struggle with major depression, PTSD, and ADHD. I was left a lone a lot as a child and raised by two alcoholics. My Father abused me. I am what you might consider to be a hyper-vigilant overachiever in my family. I create structure in my life to feed my need for validation from others and self-worth (stable house, job, kids). I am Married (Wife is 30F) and we are really struggling. I spent the last ten years working to leave the toxic relationship with my Father. My wife is not an emotional person and I have put my needs on hold for the last four years. We have a daughter (2 years old) and when she was born my wife went through Postpartum Depression and was hospitalized 3 times in 6 months. We struggled to conceive before that and it just feels like we barely know each other anymore, despite trying to make it work and doing the best to keep the ship afloat. I have struggled with suicidal ideation since childhood, and things turned really sour last year when I actively planned to die. I was working from home for nearly a year and could not take the isolation of being at home all day alone. I was actively seeing a therapist, taking meds, and doing everything in my power to keep things balanced. But I just could not do it. I ended up checking myself into the hospital and stayed in a psych ward for two weeks. When I was released I caught COVID and was back in bed for another two weeks. I ended up being out of work for two months by doctors order for mental health issues.Now, the last six/seven months have been up and down, but do include a lot of positive steps forward. I changed therapists and was referred to someone who specializes in co-occurring disorders and trauma. We did a lot of EMDR and that seemed to relieve my nightmares and panic attacks/flashbacks. we have done a lot of CBT as well and our therapeutic relationship is good... I guess? (I will come back to that point). I have worked with a lot of therapists and quite honestly she is the most qualified person I have ever worked with I am going to (or maybe the best fit, given the progress I have made).that is a bit of my background. At this moment I am feeling really discouraged and frustrated with my life and health. there is so much ""good"" around me and on the surface everything should be fine, but I feel like I am dying inside again, and again, and again. I have had a strong stretch of progress over the last three months. I even lost 13 pounds and started eating decent foods again. I journal, meditate, and attend support groups.What I am struggling right now with, speaking honestly, is the lack of affection in my marriage. As I said before, I have been on auto-pilot just trying to keep things afloat the last 4 years. My wife had a surgery, had PPD, we had a baby. I love her dearly, but we are so lost at sea right now. I carry the emotional weight of the marriage. She is mostly not affectionate and I have to chase her (and I have, so many times) to meet even the smallest emotional connection (like a hug). I am a very emotional person and I am feeling starved of love, if that makes sense. We have very open conversations, and she has started trying to change (as have I to meet her halfway, by being appreciative and available), but I am just so exhausted. And frankly, frustrated. It just does not feel organic (it feels forced). She can also be very controlling (OCPD, if you know what that is) and I find myself fighting the urge to do things her way simply for validation. it is a real cluster f&amp;\*k. Back to the therapeutic relationship I have (we will call her T). I was referred to her upon leaving the hospital last December. And I am going to be honest here, because it matters, I crushed on her almost immediately. Despite knowing little to nothing about her (which is a very important boundary), our personalities just clicked. I think that is a big part of why I have been able to make some progress. Despite our difference in age (she is early 40s), I just see a lot of me in her. We like the same music and are generally emotional creatures (think two enneagram 4s, if you know about enneagram). Two tortured souls. Anyway, I brushed this off (I would never felt this way about a therapist) and just moved a long with the sessions each week for months. Despite ignoring it, I felt that our connection grew stronger and stronger as she showed me what it is like to have someone who cares for you completely. This turned into a hot case of transference (read up on that one) driven by the disconnect I have at home with my wife. I fell madly in love with T (or whatever that one-sided relationship is).Now, I eventually told T about how I was feeling. Not to expect anything, but because I really want to recover and did not want it to hinder my progress. I wanted therapy to be about my healing and not about her. She was grateful, caring, and we processed a lot with that (about my childhood, abandonment, etc). I even began to detach (from thinking about her) and feel more self-confident. Things started feeling more balanced at home and at work. I was proud of myself. But something was still missing. Last weekend I just became so overwhelmed with sadness. Like the deep deep deep sadness of an unrequited love. It had not been on my mind for while, but then all the sudden it was. I could not sleep. My nightmares came back. I could not cry and I have become so emotionally numb. it is excruciating. I have put a lot of work in to make my days busy and fruitful, but whenever I go to bed I feel like I am surrounded by vulnerability. I feel so f\*\*ing vulnerable. I am exhausted and frustrated with my life. I am happy that I can get this level of care and support in therapy, which is changing my confidence. But at the same time my marriage is so hollow and lost at sea. We are very caring and dedicated parents (my wife and I), but it is just very much a black and white routine. And I am exhausted from trying to be that emotional plug in our relationship that carries the bag all the time. it is great that she is trying now, but I feel so frustrated with it as well (kind of like I feel that it is not genuine). Couples therapy or marriage counseling is a must at this point, but my Wife avoids therapy and generally views it as unable to help her. I have pushed in the past to start marriage counseling and it always results in her shutting me out (this happens frequently with other things). she will change the way she treats me for a few weeks then goes back to being unavailable and obsessed with work. She is a medical professional and frequently martyrs herself by never taking time off or covering for her co-workers all the time, etc. Her job and career are amazing and I could never do what she does. And I have told her that. I do my best to listen but much of the time she comes home drained and goes right to sleep after we spend some time with our daughter. She deals with intense anxiety and goes through phases of constantly trying to make things more efficient to feed a need for control. it is exhausting, despite my best efforts to understand her and accept it. She refuses therapy (individual sessions for her) and frequently cancels or pushes the subject away. She views her stoicism as strength (which it is) but does not mind that she is wrecked from work 24/7. I often feel like I am married to the medical center and I am her therapist. And it is exceedingly hard to have an equivalent conversation about my job (corporate) where she will listen actively. I have planned nearly all of our family vacations the last 7 years and she has found something wrong with each of them and never wants to go back or enjoy it in the moment. I am frustrated, like I am taken for granted.So how have I handled this? I guess I am projecting all of this onto my therapist. T has my back and we have worked on SO many new skills and tools that have created a foundation for my future growth. she is the right fit for me as a therapist (just by progress alone), but the transference is so hard to process right now. Right now she is probably the only person who is ever accepted me for who I am completely and does not abandon me. And I love her for it. And I cannot break the feelings, despite my best effort to tell myself it is not real. For all intensive purposes the relationship is artificial and one-sided, but it feels so real to me. And it breaks my heart because I will never really have her in my life. Let me rephrase that, it breaks my heart because I feel stuck and unhappy in my marriage for going on 6 years. I feel used and unappreciated at home. My daughter is my world and I am working hard to break the generational cycle of abuse in my family. I am a good, loving father and a loving husband. But I feel so incredibly unhappy, especially all of the sudden. I do not want to quit on my life, but as with my past the pain can become very unbearable. I cannot keep spending my nights alone, on the couch, or out driving a lone just to get some air. I want to feel loved so badly. I am trying to love myself. that is hard. But I am really frustrated with constantly having these cycles of progress then hitting a depressive episode. I cannot tell if it is me or the world I am living in that is the problem. I am a gentle, caring man, who wants the best and I am trying so hard to do all the right things. But I cannot live like this. I am dying inside and it is making me shrewd and aggravated with the world around me. I am fighting the urge to end things and end my pain. I am fighting to not abandon my daughter. But I feel like I cannot do this anymore. I am self sabotaging (taking a break from sessions). I messaged T with what was going on, and gave more clarity on the transference. She was grateful, professional and offered to get some extra sessions in. But the processing is exhausting (examining my childhood) and I have been at it intensively for months. I am so tired and so heartbroken. I asked her to take a break for a month or two (avoidance) because I feel like I am digging inside the pandora's box of my soul each week. I do not want to find another T and I really (REALLY) do not want to start over again. I just feel so discouraged and I feel stuck. And I feel worthless, because the only genuine care I am finding beyond my two year old daughter is in this invisible relationship I have with a stranger. And while that is boosting my confidence, it is also validating the lack of care and support I have outside of the 4 walls of the therapy room. I do not know what to do, but I am trying to not hurt myself. I just wish my brain would shut off for once so I could finally rest. That was a lot and all over the place, so thanks for reading. I appreciate your empathy in advance. I did not know where else to share it. My Mental Health is Flatlining",1

The way he said stuff against me, forced me to say things in favor of him.He tells me stop playing the victim and thinks my suicide is a way to display my ego.I want to end my life since I feel ugly, unwanted, worthless, and insignificant. I have attachment issues too and i constantly feel alone.I do not want my suicide to show myself off as a superior being. He thinks its to display moral superiority which I have no clue what that is.

I even try to stay home and avoid women as much as possible, but that leads to other things that remind me of them.there is just no way out of this. I cannot even kill myself because there is always the carrot of tomorrow, maybe tomorrow I will meet the one, but deep down I know there is no hope, I cannot compete with other dudes.

"Hello everyone, I am going to move out soon to a new house , and when I was visiting it the previous owner kept pointing out that it was well lit all day , now that is a plus for energy consumption but it could also help my mood and energy.I have been living with my parents for some years and at first my bedroom was in the only room that got directly reached by the sun, and I remember back then I did not have any depression at all.It all went downhill when I moved to this room, which is never directly hit by the sun.Its actually the first time that I think about it, but that could be part of the because.I usually feel great during the summer, when I travel and go outside a lot and get esposed for long periods to the sun, but this summer I have been mostly inside and did not feel any better, looking forward to my vacation.What do you guys think?

"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well. TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon",0

"Hi all,I have had depression since I was a kid. I have a long family history of bipolar, borderline. It was talked about and my parents have mental health issues, but the only thing I was ever treated for is ADHD.In the past, I used to have pretty bad GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and had a lot of panic attacks. I would also have some really severe points of depression where I was pretty debilitated for 1-2 weeks, but I have found for the most part my more severe points of anxiety/depression have diminished.I do have some substance issues, mainly drinking which is not a daily thing but once i start i cannot stop, just heavy binge drinking. I did used to use quite a bit of c\*ke which was a big personal and financial issue, but I have curbed that for the most part. A few of my friends actually had an intervention with me about my drinking, when I get past the point of no return with alcohol I get extremely depressive and just talk about dark stuff in my past and just want to take any and all drugs. My friends were basically like every time you drink you do this and its too much for us etc, we cannot deal w this and you need to stop. so severer depression recently has manifested itself more in substances than in my day to day.however, my day to day is meaningless and empty. I do well at work because its the one thing I am a perfectionist about, but the way I live is so depressing. I have nothing to look forward to, I wake up, go to work, go home, watch tv, sleep. Sometimes have friends over for drinks.I cannot take care of myself, I can barely maintain personal hygiene like showering or doing laundry, i have garbage all over my apartment. I have no energy or motivation to do anything. Something traumatic happened to me about 5 years ago, since then I have gained 100 pounds just with binge eating.I cannot even look at myself in the mirror, let people take photos of me. Before I had insecurities, but I still wanted to be seen. My friends do not even invite me out for day activities because on my days off I am in bed till like 5pm.I am an artist, that is the only thing i care about. i have not been able to make work in almost 2 years because the burden of it feels like too much. I feel like a fraud, like i do not even know where to start.I am not majorly depressed right now, I have been there where all I want is to die, but its more just like day in and day out meaninglessness. I dissociate a lot, always going through the motions and i feel like I am wasting my life.I am really uncomfortable with doctors, i have not been to one since 2012 lol because of a bad experience. Overall though I can barely take care of myself so scheduling appointments is something I have been delaying for years.but for those in a similar situationon antidepressants, ssris etc -has this helped you deal with the day to day? I know i should make a lifestyle change and put more effort into being happier, but it just feels so daunting. I am wondering if beginning with a prescription will get me to the point where i can begin to address the areas of my life i need to work on. pls share your medication experience/how it impacted you! i feel like its the only way for me to get somewhere because i feel like I have been completely stagnant. will antidepressants help me, or do i need to make a lifestyle change?",0

"My little brother has been and will always be my world. He grew up privileged with two loving parents who did everything for him. I grew up with the same parents. My mom and I no longer get along, but we used to be very close. My dad was emotional, verbally and physically abusive towards me all throughout my teen years. My brother told me I should not talk about it to people because it tarnished my parents name. That they took care of me, fed me, clothes me, took me on vacation. While I recognize my father feels guilty for how he treated me, he has NEVER apologized, and has not made any effort to be in my life. I do not see why I need to protect someone who never really protected me. I feel like once again I am being considered as overemotional and that my feelings, pain or my experience is not valid. Yes my father is not the same person, but that does not change my nightmares about him, nor my PTSD. Today is the first night in a while I felt worthless And did not want to fight any longer. I have my loving husband in my corner, but that is it. I love so deeply. Why cannot others love me. One person I never expected",0
"I have had chronic ideations my whole life so this is nothing new but I thought Id finally gotten to a financial place where I could find someone to talk to. My husband gets annoyed when I ask for help, I work from home, we only have 1 car and all my friends/people who give a single shit about me are hours and hours away. Bit isolated. I am tired. there is no out. There will never be. I cannot keep asking my friends to listen to me complain about the same shit over and over, they have their own shit that is more important. I do not want to work 2 jobs and do all the cooking and housework but that is just my life. Husband has a spending problem so I am looking to pick up a third job after he quits his (I support this, he was a kind man until he started this job) so I do not have to go back to noodles once a day as sustenance and selling anything of any value. Although I do not think I own anything that cost more than $50 at this point. Maybe job 3 will be what does me in. Girl can hope. I am sorry, Ill probably get rid of this soon, its not like I can be helped. that small hit in my finances did a lot of damage and I have no one I can talk to so I hoped getting it out, even just somewhere would relieve a little bit of the tension in my brain.

I have been sorta contemplating if I should talk here or not so I decided to just fuck it and do it. Lately life has been a bitch and has not been quite nice to me. I sorta carry around other peers issues in my head and they sorta become my own and it makes me suicidal and depressed whenever it bothers me. Most of the issues are from my ex and my current girl too. They just act like its nothing and they push it onto me. It breaks me slowly. I try to put boundaries up but either way they break past it. I realized that I got to live with others issues for the rest of my life. I already have my own issues but they have worsened. I have been having thoughts of suicide for the last month or so. Everything just seems to crash down on me randomly. Hello this is my first time here,0
Just kind of want to let it out and text some one for the first time in awhile preferably some one in there teens and going for a hard time aswell Looking for somebody to talk to,1
"I am not much of a reader, but I have recently wanted to give it a shot, I just do not know what book/books to start with. Most posts on here seem to be about dark or tragic topics and situations, so I thought I could offer a more positive topic that could benefit everyone here. What books have helped you cope or change your mindset while dealing with depression? Are there any books that you would recommend for someone who was/is battling depression?",0
We are already dead inside. Every day we rot a little more. I pray God puts a end to all of our suffering. We are too weak to end it ourselves or overcome whatever curse keeps us on this earth. Most of us are zombies,1
"I am so fucking fed up with everything.I have been depressed for 5 years now. I have tried everything, therapy, medication, acupuncture, chinese medicine or whatever it is. Everything. I am so done. My boyfriend fucking left me a couple months ago, i do not have any friends anymore and my family is tired of all my problems. I am just done honestly, I have been fighting this bullshit for 5 fucking years and I am so fucking tired of it. I am crying as I am typing this and I just took some lorazepam to calm down. I have autism as well and a whole list of other issues that I am dealing with every fucking day. i just called the emergency services and this dude I had on the phone did not even listen to me so I am feeling fucking terrible. I am so suicidal and it takes every single bit of strength that I have left in me not to fucking kill myself right now, because honestly, I do not see the point in keeping going. its the same stuff every day and I am just tired of it all. I guess that was my rant.Bye. I am done",0
"Does someone else have it, that they do not want to die, but also do not want to live?Like if i would het killed. I would be fine with it. I would not care. If i did not get killed, i would not mind it eighter. And you selfharm. But without a real reason? Just out of no where, you cut yourself. While you do not feel like sad sad. But also not happy ? Not wanting to die. But also not wanting to live.",0
I cannot get anywhere. Every time I try and explain how I feel I always get cut off by someone saying something that completely invalidates it. Everything makes me want to kill myself. I even tried to explain to the love of my life how I want to get better but the constant pain of dealing with this shit makes me not want to continue living. I want help. but I cannot pull myself to get it. I feel like a child still. all I want is to die and have peace. :(,1
"I am not insecure I just type in micro penis in the sex sub or others and its just men facing rejection/disappointment , becoming swingers, cucks ( not trying to kink shame) or enjoying humiliation because of something that was out of their control. I faced suicidal thoughts about this at some point but I do not care about it anymore and people will say I am overreacting but I seen and read about this I would master other things in the such as oral,fingering, dirty talk but then you hear comments like at least he made myself useful with oral you just die inside I do not know if I want to be alone by myself or not. Maybe I was a evil person in my past life and have to deal with this burden and I cannot even speak up about it because of the stigma and everyone will see as less than as a person or man because of the standards they set man to be. I already know this might be ban or block I just needed a place to vent instead of sdpI also know sex is not the end all be all but still. It affects me that guys including myself are/ will be trashed by for a piece of flesh and blood. I do not know if I want to have sex anymore if I am just going to face rejection/disappointment or humiliation",1
"Sometimes when strong feelings overwhelm my mind I feel like multiple people.Person 1: you are overreactingPerson 2: your feelings are valid but you should still disappear Person 3: you are a fucking retarded cunt that deserves pain, hurt yourselfPerson 4: you have finally delivered a child into this world after losing so many, you deserve life as much as your son Person 5: fucking disappointment I feel like I am going crazy I feel like I have alter egos",0
"I am a joke, no friends, everyone thinks I am weird, cannot talk to girls, porn addict since 6th grade ) I am in 11th now) I have lost friends, my own family probably hates me too, they think I am weird because all i do i listen to sad music and they think I am depressed and all this shit, they also think I am a Nazi because, i Just watch videos about Hitler all day because I do not know what else to fuckin' do, (No, I am not a Nazi, I just like history btw) I just stay inside and my parents get mad at me because i do not go out the house and that i need a job and i should socialize more, but i have asthma and I am scared to get covid because then I will probably die and i do not want to go out like that, but yeah just a quick rant :/ cannot take it anymore",1
"Middle school fucked me up really badly mentally. Last year I took an antidepressant and when I came off it in December (8 months ago), my sex drive went to nothing. I have only had sex with one person in my life and never really got to experience hook up culture. I have missed out on so much since I have had such low self esteem since I was 13. Now it feels like I might have a chance to recover from that after so long but now it feels like there is this other issue that just ruins everything. I feel so shitty man. I feel like my life is just a wash. I try to be positive but living without a normal sexlife is something I cannot do. I am not meant to be a monk. It feels like I just got hit with some really bad luck in life and I just need to call it at this point. Feel like I missed out on the best parts of life and now I am 26 and my sex drive is fucked I will never get to experience that I should just end it",1
"i do not know how much of it is really chemical. sometimes i think depressions one way of coping with the world. like, some people get drunk, some people do drugs, some people get depressed. because there is so much stuff out there that you have to do something to deal with it. a quote i like",1
One of my friends who was in my class keeps discussing the how they are going to commit in two days.Idk what to do and I am shaking so much out of fear...they are so content on going and I tried and tried to talk them out of it but they will not listen- I am only 14 and I cannot even process what is going to happen.Idk who to do to because school is shut for the summer and idk who to call and my parents will get mad at me for talking to them in the first place.What do I do?Who do I go to? What do I say? I need help I have never been in this situation before- please help me.... My friend keeps talking to me about suicide and told me today that they are going to commit in a few days :,1
"i feel like there is more than one of me. in me. how the fuck do i say this alright, alright. there is the first one, which is pretty much just me. the one that talks, the one that thinks, the one that is writing this. the main one i guess. then there is the second one. the one that tells me to shut the fuck up whenever i say something. the one that insults me every time i do something. the one that digs my fingernails into my palm whenever i annoy him. the one that hates me. he is also the one that calms me down if i get too angry. the one that just tells me to take deep breaths if I am shaking. he yells at me, but if i yell at myself he will calm me down. i have literal conversations with him. with myself. with the fucking mirror. i do not know why. i do not know if it is just normal or if I am fucked in the head. i do not have multiple personality disorder (probably, I am almost sure i do not). i have no idea what is going on with me. i do not know what is wrong with me, if anything",0
"I am a male in my late 20s. I use to be okay. Not perfect but I reminisce about who I use to be. I use to be proud of myself, I use to think I was attractive, I use to be ambitious. I have been in a relationship for several years. At first it was fun, we connected in odd ways. The first year. Over the years its destroyed me. I have not felt desired in years, were in a dead bedroom, I absolutely hate myself because the only way I can see her naked is her old content that was online that everyone else could see, I am made to feel inadequate even though I am the sole income and have a good career, I am told I do not help out enough even when I do, there is always backhanded comments meant to be a joke, over the years I have been worn down. My self esteem is so bad now that she said I smelled today(I shower daily and do not work a labor job where I sweat), and I literally cried in the shower as nearly a 30 year old man over something that would have never bothered me before. My self esteem and self worth is so bad that I cannot even bring myself to leave this situation anymore. This has made me pathetic for literally no reason, I have not done anything wrong. The only thing that helps is an obsessive thought that Ill always be too pathetic to act on to end my life. Its the only comforting enough thought when I am laying down that let us me fall asleep. I do not have any plans nor am I actively suicidal but its the only thought that helps. Thinking about suicide is my only release.",1
"At the beginning of last year I was employed, married, had great credit, had an apartment, a car, and a computer for entertainment. Events that followed;1. My wife let the insurance lap on our car and I got ticketed after being crashed into.2. This happened right after I came out as trans. 3. Wife could not and would not take me to physical therapy.4. Out of work, because I have to be according to doctor and lawyer. 5. Lawyer tell me I cannot move forward with lawsuit until I get medical bills and tests, which I cannot get to or pay for.6. Wife aborts planned child because I am trans while out at work.7. My job fires me because I cannot come into work because wifes car is totalled and I was a driver8. In moment of distress and grief I try to kill myself.9. I got baker acted in the hospital and not allowed to have phone or connection to outside.10. While I am inside the hospital against my will for a month my wife refused to pay any of my bills, forfeited our apartment, threw away everything that I owned including multi thousand dollar computer and trashed my truck.11. Wife withdrew all money from my bank accounts and police and bank say its legal because she had my pin.So, now I am homeless, Transportationless, moneyless, clotheless and with no credit.It seems like everyone here would tell me that things will get better, I just need to sleep on a couch or at a homeless shelter and put inordinate amounts of effort into building my life back up to less than what I started with, even though I have a shit ton of mental health issues not being treated that make it nearly impossible to keep putting in effort.People will carelessly tell me to go get help at places that I cannot get to reliably, or tell me to do this or that, even though they do not have to do those things themselves.I cannot even reliably get a job because of my credit and lack of Transportation in the USA.I am constantly in a loop of being at my lowest and I need a fucking handout and I cannot even say that without people thinking I am greedy or entitled to money I did not earn, but I am also stuck not being able to earn any money. I do not have internet and I will not even have the phone I am typing this on soon.Does anyone have any recommendations that will actually help me other than just telling me to keep going?I am really getting sick of being at such a low point and truly think of non-existence as being so much better.I have no friends and no family. I am alone. I hate that society is hypocritical and careless about suicide prevention.",1
I have pretty much always been depressed. Like since I could remember. When I was little I was always a little sad but never to that extreme but as I got older every day gets harder and harder. I am a teen and online schooled. Whenever I get out of bed (if i do at all) getting work done is the last thing on my mind. I just have this terrible brain fog and I have trouble processing everything around me. My room is so messy I can barely walk through it. It is not dirty like gross or anything but everything I own is scattered across my floor. I am to tired to take care of myself and I cannot even hold a conversation without getting angry. I am on medication that actually helps quite a bit so I have no clue what it would be like without it. I try to find a therapist but whenever I go it is like I temporarily trick myself into thinking that I am fine and completely refuse to go. Many of my friends are going off to college and I do not have the energy to maintain a long distance friendship or make new ones. I am falling behind in every aspect of my life. I try to make systems to help myself out but I wish I could just have someone come and put my pieces back together so that I can resume life. I have lost all my ambition and I do not know what to do anymore. Does anyone know what I can do. My life is a mess,0
My mum is constantly controlling and emotionally abusive. I just need to leave home. How to run away at 24. Please talk to me.,1
"Hello, I want to apologize for the very low level of English I have, I am not a native English speaker. I have been diagnosed with depression and have had TBIs with a psychiatrist since 2017. It has been very episodic as it is depression that starts through trauma or PTSD. I come to seek help here because my appointments are too short and distant from each other. I am looking for advice / discussion about this, although I have done this a lot in the past and feel like I have heard it all. Currently in my life it is rather quiet. No big event for 3 weeks, things are stable at this level. In fact, I want to completely detach myself from human relationships and even emotionally from things, already that I am ultra jaded and bored by everyone (music, sport, video games, literature, animated, ...) my passions do not stimulate me not as much as before. I also have all the things that I like + my ""Madeleine de Proust"" which fall, become null or stop lately. I am an only child and have a great relationship with my parents, but having to see their health deteriorate and the fact that my mother almost died of illness recently plays a big role. I have also experienced a lot of relationship disappointments, even I have hardly experienced that. Recently I have seen the true thoughts of my rare strong relationships. It hurts me but I accepted that deep down I get too attached and that all relationships are led to an end. Time erodes them and if it is not time it will be weariness. I have heard everything at this level, I have introspected a lot, applied advice but I only come to one conclusion: I have to detach myself emotionally from things. Everything ended up going badly in my life, hope made me suffer and I literally have no purpose in life anymore. I do not feel like killing myself, but I am tired and jaded with life. Literally everything is bad, everything sucks and it does not even make me want to try something new because things go wrong every time. Level of relationships, in love it is too complex and it causes more problems than good things and in friendship I believe that the true friendship that we see in the works does not exist. I have a strong relationship but I think I got too attached and I make the same mistakes over and over. In short what do you think? I no longer have faith in human relationships",0
"Nothing in my life is even going wrong but I feel so hopeless. Not even sad, just apathetic and disillusioned. Like there is no point to any of this. I go to work and I come home, sometimes I visit my mom and my childhood pets. I hate that my childhood is over; I do not know how to move on to another life. I think when my mom passes away I am going to commit suicide. I do not have anyone else that will ever love me as much as she does. That and I do not want to live to watch the Earth die. Everything about life now is exhausting. Social media has ruined everyone is brainnobody is authentic and everyone does everything for scraps of attention on the internet. The people who matter do not care about the Earth or people suffering. I do not want to get old and lose my youth and beauty. I do not want to exist in the world as it is and I will not want to exist without the people I love. Fun moments are fleeting and scarce yet I am too tired to seek out new experiences. I am so disappointed that this is just what life is. The same nothingness every day until one day you realize that you have wasted it waiting for your life to finally begin. what is the point. Hopelessness",1
"I asked him how it was different. Why taking a thyroid medication for the rest of my life to correct a chemical imbalance was better than taking an antidepressant to correct a chemical imbalance. He did not have an answer. My husband, who ""does not like"" antidepressants, was very excited at the idea that if my depression is related to low thyroid I could take thyroid medication to help it",0
"I have struggled with suicidal thoughts on and off for years and they have come back recently... on top of that all of my friends except the 1 toxic one have been ghosting/ignoring me, my laptop broke a few days ago, i gained weight, my mom has been fighting with me a lot more, and much much more... its making it really hard to stay but i know suicide help lines are almost always shit so I am asking you guys I need help.",1

"Four years of treatment and nothing works. Meds are only good for a few months and that is if they are any good at all. I have no use for therapy. I am pretty sure that I am doing worse than I was before I would started treatment. So, I am done. No meds. No therapy. I will just have to accept that this depression will not go away. At least I will not have to deal with side effects and condescending psychiatrists and therapists. I Quit",0
"As a person with depression, did you have much awareness during an episode as to how badly you were treating your significant other? My partner has been slowly withdrawing for a few months now - we are at the point where the only words spoken to one another are good morning and good night. It is like living with a complete stranger. Prior to this, we had always been very close, affectionate and in sync. We were not only in love, but best friends. I hate using the word 'were' but I really do not know where we stand anymore.Should I be concerned that he seems to be acting relatively 'normal' around his family and friends but completely shuts down when we are alone? He has admitted he is depressed but the fact that I am the only one seeing it makes me think I am the because. He assured me that it was not, but I still have some doubt. Awareness while depressed?",0
"I have wanted to die for a long period of my life but the truth is is that I am actually terrified to die and i think I tell myself I want to die to make myself think I am not afraid of deathI'm not really sure who I am , I constantly need to be around others who give me some sort of insight of who I am in order to feel like myself. Because I really have no idea. I could not tell you what I like or what I do not like I am constantly anxious , scared , worried , sad but I always tell people I am okayI tell people okay because I do not feel that I deserve any empathy or sorrow. I have zero confidence in myself. I usually end up quitting my job because I do not think I do good enough at work or even deserve to make money to take care of myself. I am addicted to nicotine , alcohol and adult films on the internet. I do not necessarily really know how I am actually feeling all the time, sometimes I think I am not actually awake or alive even. I broke up with my ex because I thought she deserved better. I hate being alone, but only because I like being alone when i should not be. A dream of mine since I was a kid was to be known , to have some sort of legacy but I honestly do not think I will ever achieve that. I tell people I do not believe in God when I actually do but think that I am not worthy of a God. I am struggling with identity crisis. But I have zero motivation to solve this problem. I am constantly unmotivated when it comes to things that are good for me , but when it is bad for me I will stop at nothing to get it. I put myself in shitty situations because I like pain and think it is all I deserve. I constantly seek affirmation from others when really what I want is to feel comfortable in my own mind and body. I was molested when I was five years old. I have ADHD.I am afraid that when I die , people will forget about me within a couple days. these are a few things I have been dying to get off of my chest",0
"Just keep dreaming and never have to respond to anything... no need to eat, drink and make money to live.

"I am 14 and I know that my depression is just a bunch of chemicals acting up in my brain. My brother told me that my sadness is a phase too and at the time I was angry at him for that but he was telling the truth. I have no purpose, no talent, no personality, no friend, no faith, no goal, no true love for anyone or anything other than my fantasies. I am disappointed in myself and in everyone and everything.Depression sucks...my grades at school are not going so well. I am very negative about everything. I hate school. Everyday feels the same. I try so hard to be happy but it does not go anywhere. I tried socializing more with people but I get ignored evey single time.I am just so hopeless and helpless. I am sure the world is beautiful...but maybe I do not have a place in it. I am sick and tired of everything",0
"Throwaway account because my partner follows my main account and it might be compromised too, for reasons I will explain soon.I am 33 and currently in living as an immigrant in a EU country, not my own (I hail from another continent), since 4 years or so with my fianc.I have health issues, both mental and physical, that prevent me from working since about 2 years ago (CPTSD, Clinical depression, burnout, chronic pain due to severe injuries I received), I do not really speak the language here that well, partly because it took me over a year to become ""fluent"" and then because covid happened and I went months without seeing other human other than cashiers at the market or my partner) so I lost a lot of proficiency.I am not saying he is a bad person or that he is isolating me, because he is been doing his best to take care of me. it is just... I have lost so much freedom here, I am unhappy and no one really takes my need for help seriously.I am not in contact with my family anymore because one of my parents is very dangerous, controlling and abused me since my childhood. Like most abusers this parent projects a great public persona and divided the rest of the family in a ""either you support my side or are against me"" so most of my family cut contact with me to prevent drama with my parent. This person has tried to stalk me and threaten me if I speak up on their abuse, to the point of finding people I worked with years ago and using them as messengers.As you might guess I became overprotective of my privacy, I functionally do not have much of a social media presence anymore, take pictures or even talk to former friends much. I also do not have friends here either.I know my parent has stalked and found most of my social media accounts and tried to find my addresses when I move to another place (no idea how they manage to do that but they have even found my landlord info twice in 6 years despite being in another country). Imagine how bad this person is that I moved continents just to get away from them.I have been trying to get therapy here, but my partner thinks it is unnecessary and an unneeded expense. I cannot get treatment for my chronic pain for the same reasons, I cannot even speak of pain killers without being treated like an addict in our house.I probably fucked up coming here and I probably should have never done so I do not have anyone, I do not have friends, or family or anyone that can help me, I have no place to call home or to return to, I just feel so alone and trapped and isolated and I miss human contact so much I do not remember the last time I spoke with another human that was not a cashier. I wish I could escape but where to? there is nowhere.I just keep hearing this voice in my head telling me that if I kill myself I will not have to hurt anymore and I will be able to rest. I might be even lonelier but it might be better, I have not been pain free in so, so long.I am just so afraid of messing up because if I do I know I will face retaliation and things will just, somehow, be worse. Everyday in this prison I see the kitchen knives and wish I could slice and dice myself into oblivion to escape this.I am in France but if you are going to suggest the local hotlines just do not, already tried that a while back and the guy just told me ""this is beyond my level"" and hung on me. I am having intrusive dark thoughts because I am isolated in a country that is not my own and have nowhere to return to",1

I am supposed to be the strong one, that is why they like me. that is who I am to myself too. So I cannot talk to someone under the ultimatum that these thoughts imply. I cannot bring myself to have to pay some therapist to listen. When my sister tried to kill herself I am who she called for help. When my mother needs protection from my psychotic brother I am who they call. When he needs saving I am who he calls. When my friends need serious advice I am who they turn to, and when I last turned to my best friend he ghosted me until I fell back into that role. Vut I still have to be here for him lmao. The women I have had in my life think I am some mysterious macho tough guy, but the second I reveal any vulnerability they pull back and I can see the disgust and pity on their faces and it hurts like nothing else, suicide would hurt lessI am the strong one, to myself and others. there is no ruining my image and honour by seeking ""help.""

"I cannot stop cutting really badly, I made a huge gaping one about an hour ago that extends from one end of my arm to the other end and I have hastily half glued half stitched it up. I keep saying this but it keeps happening...""this one is the worst so far""Like... To think before a few months ago I had not done it past cat scratches and now I am going super overboard... I burned myself for the first time like last week, I do not understand how I have gotten it this bad, and the worse I do it the worse I feel like I need to do it next time, I am having dreams that I am cutting arms off. I have had 4 attempts on my life this year and I feel like only one time I was not fully serious about it, the other three times were serious attempts and the feeling afterwards is so shameful, and embarrassing.How do I get the nasty voice out of my head telling me to keep trying to die? it is not always there but when it comes I cannot get out of it, I do not end up feeling sad, just numb... And then I do something really dangerous. Is it because I have made it a self fulfilling prophecy to not live to see next year? How much longer do I have to cry every day? I had a therapist come over today but it was really weird because we could not hear each other properly through our masks. Self harm/suicide vent",0

My wife is currently in an uncontrollable rage caused by depression (so angry I have had to leave the house). We do not have any real problems but she says she will not calm down til I apologize for what she is angry about.The problem is something really petty which she actually caused.

"I had everything ready to go, and my note was already sitting on the table of the hotel room I was in. I was stuck on a vacation with my family who does not care about my well being and would care less if anything bad happened to me. I got into a huge argument with my mom at universal studios because her boyfriend kept talking about gun violence and how he would shoot me dead if he could because I am trans. She took his side over mine because it was a joke. I left the park early and she yelled at me for being a waste of time, energy, and money. Honestly I agree with her. I self harmed a little bit once I got back to release the pressure from the argument and then I prepared to take my life in the hotel. I would have done it any other day but there is something so cathartic about self harming that I had a major migraine and I was exhausted. So I took everything down and ripped up my note and took a nap. I am not sure if that is a sign but maybe when I get back home Ill do it since that is a more appropriate setting. I was too tired to kill myself today.",1
"there is just so much to say..I was one of those people who would try to help all those here, and on various other suicidal subreddits. I would tell them to hang in there, and try to count their blessings, when did I change? When did I get so filled up with sadness and loneliness?My heart, it is this huge hole, it keeps growing bigger and bigger, heavier and heavier. I am always on the edge, like the tears would fall out any moment. I do not have any friends irl, my parents do not allow me on socials, so being here is actually me desperately trying to find friends. Some of them are begging me to find therapy, and they keep asking people advice for a depressed friend. it is a label now, I am depressed. And I hate that, I hate how I cannot be happy even though I am so good at pretending to be. I feel like I am annoying people, being a burden to them, making their lives miserable. My parents think I am destroying them by being rebellious, not eating and stuff, they say I want to die, like it is my fault if I do want to. I know they love me, but they have stopped appreciating me, completely. I tried to tell them I am lonely, like 4 times, and they taunted me saying that why do I need anyone in my life. Why? Because I cannot control my thoughts, they haunt me, traumatise me.I recently (4 months ago) had my first break up, and it has left me in shattered pieces. I loved him so much. he is now dating, and I am having these sharp pains in my chest, I am nauseous all day, my entire body aches, my hormones are all over the place. I have even started to get nightmares where he would kill me, stab me over and over again, and hug me, telling me it will be alright.I cannot bear the pain anymore. I tried to use online therapy since my parents will not allow actual professional help, and I chickened out. I am just so scared if they will find out, and god knows what will happen then. I am not even sure if I should post this...I feel like I am whining for no reason at all I do not want to die, I am so scared, I am scared of everything",1
"my english 10 teacher during my sophomore year of high school one time she smacked her butt in front of the class (she told the class not to report her), she pretended to hit on a classmate and would give the class naughty looks.during my junior year my us history teacher was a narcissist. she thinks people with depression or having a hard time are wanting attention, she thinks knows them but she does not. she smiles if people got mad, it looked narcissistic. she pulled me out of the room and threatened to call my mom for disrespecting her but i was sticking up for a classmate who did nothing wrong, she yelled at him. i feel bad for anyone who has to deal with her. she denied me a piece of candy for being scared when she approached me. i was the shy emo kid (i still am emo, but not shy) in my school. she wanted students to bottle up their emotions and not get things off their chest to anyone. she kicked out students for petty reasons. i hated her. one i day, this take place the day after i missed the bus after school. i told her i missed the bus home and she said could take me home. one time my she whispered in my science teacher's ear while she and her were smiling at me. one time i told my us history i missed the bus the previous day i told her it came back to get me, she said to me she could have taken me home (made me feel uncomfortable).during my senior year of high school. i had an english teacher who said she was teasing me (made me feel uncomfortable). she called me a nickname (she did a lot of times) i did not like, one day i ignored her and she threatened to call my mom, i got mad, and she kicked me out of the class, she said she called me the name because she was teasing me. whenever i told her asl teacher was not a good teacher (its true she was not good), she would tell me to stop complaining saying I am just exaggerating, so i stopped venting to her. however she did hand out candy every friday (probably as a bribe)which teacher was the worst?

"Recently, I was forced to leave my year old semi feral cats as I relocated to a new area, and the poor, skittish creatures could not handle the change. So they stayed while I moved to my new place. I have been a wreck since then. Almost everything in my life reminds me of them. I miss them unbearably and do not know how to cope. I have been crying throughout the days and I just do not want to do anything other than either cry or hug my cats somehow. They were my closest companions in the lonely post pandemic world. I cannot even fully express my feelings to anyone in real life because they will all make fun of me. I am in so much pain right now, worried sick about my cats who keep crying for me, I have been told. This is terrible. Being forced to leave my cats has triggered a downward mental health spiral",0

There was a rope from the ceiling. A thick rope. I was in my bed and the rope was hanging beside me. I do not know why but in that dream I grabbed the rope and it suddenly tightened around my neck and i cannot breathe. I keep struggling. And then i found myself on my bed again. Every time i try to sleep all i can think of is how i accidentally commit suicide in different ways and i cannot go back. If only I am not afraid of what comes after. If only i do not have to keep having these feelings and thoughts. Why am i so ungrateful with my life.. I get that feeling again.",1

"Bear with me please, this may be extremely lengthy but I will encourage you to at least read, some of the information in this may be helpful to you.&amp;#x200B; Also as a note, there is going to be a lot of technical talk here. Please do not be dismayed by this, it is an info Dump just fair warning.&amp;#x200B;First of all, welcome and thank you for taking the time to read this. Given the subreddit I am posting this on, chances are that this information may be of some benefit to you.&amp;#x200B;I am an observer, not in a solely perceptual context but I see, for lack of a better term, everything. I am kind of monster in that sense. I am not like other human beings and to address that statement, I give you my own personal theory on the 4 main aspects that you humans associate with being human or at least how almost every society would like to be seen. I give you, The 4 Core Personality.&amp;#x200B;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;let us start with the basics. What are these 4 cores and how do they pertain to personality?&amp;#x200B;The 4 cores are; differentiation, extravertedness, conscientiousness, and an overall positive disposition. &amp;#x200B;How are these 4 aspects incorporated into our understanding of personality?&amp;#x200B;These 4 aspects give people a general overview of who you are and how you react in a given context. Say you are a natural introvert, that plays into how you are perceived by others. Some may see you as distant, closed off or uninterested. This feeds into how they interact with you, just as an example. There are countless ways this construct comes into play on a daily basis, in every interaction you have with someone else and in some cases even within yourself. &amp;#x200B;By creating this construct, there is a natural field of exclusion. Granted, societies generally try to keep this umbrella as open as possible, within a given measure. Which leads to outliers, people who are naturally not built within that frame or for those of us who have had that aspect stolen away via actions of others, trauma.&amp;#x200B;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;let us dive a bit deeper into these 4 cores and what they actually mean, what branches they build and how psychology aims to utilize these things to help the outliers who seek assistance. &amp;#x200B;Starting with differentiation, this measures our ability to regulate our emotions, particularly in events of high stress. In short, it is your ability to keep undesirable emotions from being expressed and working those issues out within yourself. &amp;#x200B;To give you an example, you might think of a person going through the cash register line at your local supermarket. At the finalization of the transaction, the person offers several coupons but those coupons are mostly expired. &amp;#x200B;Are you the kind of person to:&amp;#x200B;A: chalk it up as a loss and just pay&amp;#x200B;B: require a manager come for the purposes of clarification &amp;#x200B;C: completely lose your mind, throwing the items off the belt and at the cashier as well as other customers &amp;#x200B;If you picked C, CONGRATULATIONS!! You just won the grand prize, take it away Johnny!&amp;#x200B;you will be enjoying your stay at a luxurious jail cell, a room with a view! And if that is not enough, you get an all paid trip to your destination!&amp;#x200B;Thanks Johnny. &amp;#x200B;Although, emotional interaction is a bit more complex than that. Sometimes it is more about your ability to control undesirable emotions in certain situations. A couple examples I can give you would include; laughing at a funeral, falling in love at first sight, getting frustrated when the waiter forgets your water. Things of this nature.&amp;#x200B;Society does not ask that you NOT feel these things. It asks, quite simply, that you do not act on those emotions. How you work out those emotions is of no regard to society, it does not care how you deal, so long that you DO deal.&amp;#x200B;Next up, we have extravertedness which is your ability to maintain several connections with others, your ability to enjoy the company of several others (being in a large group or ""herd""), your ability to rely upon others as well as your ability to allow others to rely upon you.&amp;#x200B;For this example, we will turn to Susan. Susan is a bit of a homebody and prefers to be at home reading books. However, her new friend is more extraverted and wants to invite Susan to her cousin's wedding this next Thursday. What should Susan do?&amp;#x200B;A: begrudgingly go to the wedding and hold the action over her friend's head in the future&amp;#x200B;B: Suck it up and go attend the wedding and try to have fun&amp;#x200B;C: Say she will have a migraine that day and cannot go&amp;#x200B;If you picked B, congratulations!! you have made the right call. This demonstration of willingness to interact just made a wonderful impression on your new friend and now you have got a trauma bond to boot because her sister got too plastered and was puking her guts out and you were there, helping your friend to help her sister into the bathroom stall. You now have a friend for life so long as nothing catastrophic occurs between the two of you. &amp;#x200B;Next on the chopping block is conscientiousness. This is the measure of your ability to provide kindness, compassion, sympathy and empathy. Your ability to foster a connection with someone and help that connection grow, helping those around you to grow as well as continuing to grow yourself. &amp;#x200B;For this example we turn to our announcer, Johhny who is one of the most conscientious people I have known in my life (Legal disclaimer: Johnny is not a real person, this is a fictional character. Any resemblance to any person living or dead is not intended).&amp;#x200B;Johnny is at home, working on the truck when a buddy calls him. His buddy is an alcoholic and is calling because he just slipped and got drunk. What should Johnny do?&amp;#x200B;A: \*hangs up phone\* not my damn problem &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;B: oh man, what happened? Where are you so we can get a cab for you&amp;#x200B;C: I am sorry man, where are you at? I will come pick you up.&amp;#x200B;If you picked A, CONGRATULATIONS!! Your friend was just pronounced dead after stumbling into oncoming traffic because he thought he saw a silver dollar in the middle of the street.&amp;#x200B;And now we come to the final round of our show, this is it. Winner takes all. The ability to believe in the overall good.&amp;#x200B;This is a measure of how you see others. Are you able to trust others to be as considerate, conscientious and reliable as yourself? &amp;#x200B;For this example, we will turn to Betty. Betty has always struggled with believing other people are genuinely good due to several traumatic experiences through her life. Though she is trying to get better through therapy. One day, her therapist says something that does not quite sit right with Betty's morals, what should Betty do?&amp;#x200B;A: discuss this discomfort in more detail and clarify how it effects her view of her therapist &amp;#x200B;B: immediately and abruptly get out of her chair and exit the room screaming ""you are the f###ing DEVIL!!""&amp;#x200B;C: keep her feelings to herself and hold onto that resentment &amp;#x200B;If you chose A, congratulations! you have made the right call. Sometimes it is hard to believe other people are genuinely good but the true societal test is in being able to establish reason and context as to why you do not trust people but still have the desire to in order to improve your life and the connections you establish. &amp;#x200B;Well thank you for tuning in today, I am your host, the abyss, saying have a wonderful day out there and you are beautiful!&amp;#x200B;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;Now that you have an understanding of what I am talking about, here is my dilemma. I see you, I know what is expected of me. But people keep insisting that I be authentic. Be true to myself. &amp;#x200B;What if I cannot do both of these things simultaneously? What if I have to choose one way or another? would not it just be more beneficial to just obey the rules and hope that one day I will believe it through social reinforcement? Or do I keep being who I actually am? This observer, forsaken from society. All alone and cold, only able to see the wonders and treasures of humanity. Never to actually take part in those things.&amp;#x200B;This creates a major dilemma inside me. it is not bad enough that I am severely depressed, that I feel utterly worthless, that I have only a few strands of hope left to hold onto. It was not bad enough, I had to know in great detail the reasons why I am not like the rest of you. Why I am a monster. &amp;#x200B;But in that knowledge, i also know exactly how to be one of you. But i have to sacrifice my own comfort in this eternal cell to do so. I have to sacrifice myself to become one of you. I cannot keep being pinocchio, nobody wants a hollowed out puppet. I have to be a real boy if I want for real people to accept me.&amp;#x200B;That is my dilemma and I know I am the only one who can make that decision. But what would you do? I have a Dilemma (4 core personality)",0

Has anyone here found success in figuring out how to stop it from happening and ruining their lives... with the power of some other force besides medication?

"In my mid 20's and worked shitty jobs all my life in my locality. I do not have any prospects, and no pathway to something to drag me out. do not even have a general area to pursue, which makes it difficult to even get motivated or hopeful. The past year has been even more isolating and difficult, and I feel like a she will of a person now. If I am not in work it is difficult for me to even get out of bed, cos I do not see a point anymore. Talking to friends is triggering because I do not even remember the person I used to be when I was alive, so I have pulled away a lot from them. I do not know how or where to begin, or if I even can get back to a position of existing beyond living on autopilot. Being reminded of events a few years ago is like reading about a stranger, and I do not even know who I am anymore. it is hard to express this, and I do not know if anyone will understand or relate to what I am saying, but I feel totally lost and hapless at even expressing my current outlook and emotions. At a certain stage I will not have it in me to even keep this up, cos the struggle is gnawing away at me day by day. Is it too late?",0
"Hi everyone, first time poster!Maybe this is a post for some commiseration, but does anyone feel awesome, interesting, cool and not boring for long stretches and people always see you as that but then one day, you start overthinking things and the complete opposite feelings occur? it is especially worse when you clearly are in the wrong mindset and low self-worth just consumes you and no one, even close people, detect that? It feels like there is an asshole version of yourself inside your brain that constantly deflects all positive thoughts about you and intercepts it all. I am doing CBT and seeing a therapist every week, but I hate how these feelings rush over you and consume all of the progress you have made. I met this really cool girl 2 weeks ago and we have been having such a vibrant, interesting conversation and we have so much in common and looking forward to do things together. However, yesterday I smoke some weed with some friends (who I actually am trying to ween away from due to their different values, toxic men, etc.) and then all of a sudden I am having these feelings of not being good enough or cool enough for this dope girl I met. I am a man by the way and I find toxic masculinity to be something I really do not want to be a part of but I feel I am surrounded by men like that in my life. I am always looking at articles and posts about traits that are uncharismatic or make someone boring, and I objectively do not feel like any of those characteristics define me, but it still sucks that for every three giant leaps you take in confidence, it takes one day to have it crash down. My little brother yesterday told me I am extremely confident, and have been all of my life, and my coworkers always know I have a fun personality. How does one remind themselves that they are as cool and awesome as everyone around them? Every time I feel like I am on a stretch of happiness, one day will take me right back into feelings of low self worth",0
"I just really feel like everything I do, something wrong happens. And its not something that I can overlook or hope I can push through it. Its always something that completely stomps me from doing anything until the issue is resolved no matter how time consuming or stressful. I am really tired of living like this Life",0
"I do not fucking care if people make mistakes I am a fucking dumbass!! I know there are people who are worse than me but idc they can kill themselves if they want, at least I am aware of how much of a fucking failure I am.

"Not really suicidal per se but I have always had one thought from the past that has effected me even up until this point. I used to work at a grocery store called Publix and was a produce clerk for a while. Anyways this memory from the past consists of my assistant manager being frustrated with me because I did not get enough product out in a set amount of time. I remember his face getting red and yelling at me on the floor in front of customers telling me to go home because I was not of any help. This was the type of manager to order so much product and make his workers pack so much shit it was disgusting. He used to hide products behind the shelves just so that it would ""get out"" and make him not look bad. Idk why this specific memory just makes me feel like shit but it is a time where I tried my hardest to do something and I was belittled so much by this jackass that his red infuriated face is still stuck in my memory.

"In the last few years my life completely fell apart, my health went to shit, so did my career prospects, I am 33 and even though I did well in college and got into grad school, I could not make it in grad school now I am back home living with my parents like a loser. Every time I try to pull myself up, my health gets worse. I take a step forward and get knocked back 2. I am very close to just being done with it all. I hate reminding myself, that unless I am done living, then I have to keep trying.",0

"I was on a date a couple of weeks ago. I feel awful. He said I reminded him of Fiona from Shrek. I lost over 30kg now. I weigh 54kg, 1.70m, and I am still fat. He started to poke my belly fat, proceeded to tell me I was still chubby. He pointed out my nose is crooked and that I should consider surgery. Why cannot I just be normal.I started to feel better about myself after losing weight. I did. And everything I felt insecure about came back just like that. I went on a walk last night. And I realised that it does not matter. Thick or thin. Make up, no make up. Working hard, hardly working. Poor, rich. I am worthless. It does not matter what I do. What I look like. In the end we are all going to die anyway. So I rather die now, while I still have some dignity left. Then die when I am old and have faced even more pain. I have tried, and tried and tried",1
"I finally understood what I lack in life, and what I tried to get for all my life - sense of communtiy, and also love. Never had those, and my life is really empty.I do not want to go further alone. It gives me nothing but pain. So, jsut finishing last stuff, experiencing last drops of warm sun rays later this August, and I will happily and calmly kill myself. WIthout drama, without rush. I will be ok then. I do not want to go further alone. I will never have community or love, tho things which are badly missing in my life, so I will end it by Fall.",1
"I have recently come to terms with the fact that I have mental health issues stemming from a lot of childhood trauma and started to seek help. I have been more open about talking to peers, I have been seeing a therapist, etc. these all seem and sound like good things but it honestly feels like its worse than its ever been. My mind is constantly racing with all these negative thoughts and I try to deal with them with positive self-talk but it just feels so pointless and stupid to me. Its hard to get out of bed everyday and all I want to do is go home and be alone in the silence. The thing is, I am not even happy when I am there. I just feel so alone all the time. I had a buddy call me this morning and tell me he appreciated me and all sorts of positive things but I cannot even find the energy to care. Things just ring so hollow and I do not know if Ill ever find true meaning. Depression is an interesting contradiction I have found. Thanks for reading, just needed to get it off my chest. Rough going",0
"I have tried everything, from exercise to medication, from calling a friend to vent about my problems, to calling a suicide hotline and getting myself in a psych guard. From group therapy, to psychologists, to meditation, eating healthy, owning an emotional support animal. Nothing, absolutely, nothing works. I am alone in this life, the few friends I had grew tired of my problems, and I cannot blame them, I have been so lost inside my own mind that I thought ""asking for help"" could be a way out of my mysery. Turns out it never was, I basically used every single person I was ever close to so they could fix my own broken soul, and I feel so guilty. I just wanted to have what they have, I did not even want to be happy, I just wanted to be okay.I have lived past my expiration date, I should have stopped trying a long time ago. I do not want these last words to make everyone I knew feel depressed, the opposite actually. I hope you understand why I did it, I just cannot find happiness, cannot find the stability I was looking for all these years. I got tired of trying. Please put yourself in my shoes. I am not sane.I got to the point where I realized I have gone crazy, depression took all what was left of me, I am just not who I used to be. The person everyone knew died a long time ago, all what is left here are remains.I just want you to know and understand that I did this for the best, I needed this to free myself from all the pain I have been going through. Today I can finally rest.Whoever is reading this, I wish for the best to you and I love you, I understand the pain that you are going through, I really do, I wish I could free you, I wish I could hug you right now.Mom, please do not feel guilty.

"I am close to my immediate family and a handful of friends but I do not I actually care about them. I am always pleasant to them and have fun and I have been there for everyone at their lowest points but I feel like I am always faking it. Fake it till you make it right? But for how long? I do not like attention on myself but I do see everyone as a means to an end so I guess I am very selfish. I am being nice to everyone else even if I am not being true to myself. Idk am I just really good at pretending? When I am there for people, I act like I care about them so well that I can conjure up all kinds of emotions that feel so real even to me at the moment. Then I leave and its like someone turned off the switch and I go back to not caring about them at all and wondering if my act convincing enough. This all feels so edgy to me honestly but I just want to know. Am I narcissist? Why does this happen? Is it just a phase and if so, how do I get out of it? It gets pretty tiring having to put up with the act in every waking moment. I wake up everyday and shudder at the thought of putting on a show for everyone else again. I am very happy. I do not think I am depressed which would because the apathy. I have a nice life and I take care of myself. I just need to know when I will not need to act anymore. I do not really hold myself at a high value and I like to think that I am very self aware. For reference, everyone close to me have each called me selfish and manipulative at least once but I really think I have improved and have been there for them more this past year. Or were they right, and I have just become better at covering my mistakes and become more convincing? Why do not I care for anyone?",0

"So many people post here. you are lucky if you get more than one comment. A lot of the time people just upvote and do not even say anything and that is if your post is popular. Normal posts have the opposite problem. Maybe a few comments but no upvotes. Oh well. I do not know maybe this post is stupid. I am probably wrong, I usually am. I just know that every time I come here, because I want to be with people that get it, I end up disappointed. And its ironic. Because this community is here so that we do not feel alone. But it honestly never helps me. Yet I come back. Either to leave a comment, to reach out to someone I relate to, or to a make a post that I delete immediately. All of which pretty much leads to more nothing. More loneliness. So yeah I just had to say that. And obviously none of you guys will even see this. But I hope that whoever does has an okay day. I am still trying to learn to celebrate the ok days, myself. Because those are my new good days now. I do not have good days anymore, but that is okay. I am trying to get by without doing anything to hurt myself or the people around me. If I manage to do that, then my day was okay and that is good. Too bad, when it rarely happens, its still never enough. But at least its better than the bad days. Posting here to try to feel better is almost as futile as living.",1

"I am 17 and my little sister is 10 years old. When we were younger we were two peas in a pod. I love her more than anything. Our relationship took a turn for the worst my freshmen yearly high school. The year before my parents had gotten divorced and it really took a toll on me mentally. It did not help that soon after my parents got divorced my mom made us move into her boyfriends house right away (I still see my dad often). To this day I cannot say I am fully okay. But my little sister was not really bothered by the divorce. In fact she loved my moms new boyfriend and I was mad at her for it. I cannot explain why and that is not really the point of this post anyways. Sometime into my sophomore year things got really bad between my mom and her boyfriend. They started hitting each other, breaking things, and often times my moms boyfriend would storm out of the house leaving my little brother and sister to go and comfort my mom. My sister even slept with my mom sometimes. Things got so bad my mom and her bf from up and we moved houses and this is where my sister began to not be okay. My mom and her bf spend a couple months apart but it did not take long for them to get back together. We moved back in with her bf at the end of my junior year and now I am a senior. I noticed that something was right with my sister so I sat down with her in her room to talk. She bursted out crying when I asked her if she just wanted her big sister back to talk to her. Our relationship is slowly building up and we are slowly getting back to where we were. But today while I was doing my sisters hair I noticed she would not look at herself in the mirror when I asked her to put her head up she looked straight at the ceiling. Later while I was doing her hair still she began crying and she still will not tell me what is wrong. I am begging my mom to take my sister to therapy but she is a piece of garbage and at this point I might as well be the mom of my siblings. Please help me idk what to do. My little sister is depressed and I do not know what to do",0
"I am not sure when I will kill myself, that largely depends on how things turn out and largely random chance and circumstances. But it will probably be sometime in the next couple of years. It does not really make me feel sad, because once you are dead you do not exist, so nothing you did matters. It makes me feel so relieved that all of the bullshit in my life and all my stupid decisions can just not be my problem any more. Life is hard and I am not very tough, and I am stupid enough to consistently unwittingly sabotage myself. Offing myself literally solves all my problems at once, I am surprised more people do not do it. But most people also bring children into the world to suffer, and I do not understand the reasoning behind that either. I do not view my own suicide as something tragic. it is a relief.",1

"I work at a ice cream kiosk, and fuck me.I keep doing things wrong,Today the ice cream machine had some yellow stuff growing inside and had to be emptied and cleaned and I did not know what to do even though I have seen it done before, and the boss shouted at us again and it is sucks.I cannot focus, it is soo hot inside there and my mind feels like it is being fried, we do not get breaks even though I work 7.5 hours 5 times a week and I only get to drink a bottle of water during the day.What sucks is that a lot of the time I am too slow at closing because I have to clean and get everything in order for the next day and I also need to serve costumers too, it especially sucks when they order a milkshake, because I have to thoroughly clean it all over again so it does not stink the next day.I need to empty the dirty water under the sink, wash the floor, wash the counters, check and fill what is missing, get shouted at, see what we do not have and is needed more of and write it down.I cannot work overtime all the time, the owner does not have that kind of money for thing's that has been broken and need to be repaired.When I first started everything went fine and I actually was applauded on doing good, but now I feel like I have to keep doing good and better, but my mental health has taken a beating recently and I am falling into old habits of suicidal ideation, I feel so hopeless and I am terrifed of being fired, I keep waking up at 5 am and cannot fall asleep until 2 am or later.I take every criticism and failure to heart, I need to be as perfect as humanly possible, because if you are not you get scolded or fired and shit, it is a start up business, so it might even fail because of bad employees like me.I have always wanted to function like a good person, but I do not know if I can, or if I even want to anymore, I want to punch the fucking wall and shout my lungs out.

"So my mental health has deteriorated really badly over the past year and I have just had a breakdown. I dropped outta high school a month ago thinking I could start to learn all kinds of skills which I could use to live in a rural area some day. I also had dreams to live the life some people over in r/vagabond live but then reality hit me. I realised that life is a lot harder than I thought and that it really is not easy to be living in a rural area with near to nothing or the vagabond life. So I have basically dropped out of college for some ridiculous dream that I am now disillusioned about. I have no qualifications or anything and my parents are really starting to hate me. The darkness of the real world has now hit me and so I need to prepare for my eventual leave onto the streets, I doubt I will let myself live another few years at most because I have never hated life as much as I do now and I am completely despairing.

I have been in therapy for years and I am still the worlds most passive, non confrontational person and literally no matter what I do I get hurt worse and worse every time I try to work at it. And if I do not work at it I get badly burned too. I do not have anyone that is super close to me and literally always feel lonely. No medication has helped me and no therapy either. I would love for someone to shoot me in the head and stop me from being a fucking waste of space. I am literally evidence of it being possible to be a lost because.

"Did any of you used to be really into things like hobbies but just stopped because you knew you would be dead in the somewhat near future and putting effort into learning things and growing as an individual would just be pointless? Like you are putting all of this effort in and will never see the end result of a polished skill that takes years to produce?For me it started around 19 (I am 25 now). I used to be really into learning the piano, reading books on history, psychology, investing, nonfic and so on, working towards being a physically healthy person, and overall just trying to develop/fix myself. I think this was when I got into self-help stuff and gained a lot of hope for the future at that time.Since about 23 I have just started to stagnate heavily. I stopped doing the things that were making me a better person. My mind just tells me I am wasting my time and that what I am doing is pointless. I will never be a whole human being and I will never live a good or even normal life. Why even try to grow? I am just going to fall all the way back down to rock bottom like I have time and time again. When did you stop growing?",0

I thought I was getting betterI do not know if any of you have watched Ozark but at one point the bipolar guy talks about how he like wakes up one day and it is like oh I remember now how I feel or something like that I do not think I am bipolar but I really relate to that part. it is like I am doing alright for a while but only because for some reason I do not really get to feel my emotions and then it flips back and I remember that I am still depressedthis is kind of fucked but I spend a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if some serial killer took out my entire extended family and I could either live alone and do whatever or just end it without making anyone else sad yknow but also that would ruin me so it would almost certainly be the latter not again,0

Things are going to shit and all my brain knows is how to hurt myself. But when I spend time with my little sister, things feel so much better.

"I did the best I have ever done yesterday. I brushed my teeth, took a shower, meditated for 20 whole minutes, walked for almost an hour, made a schedule for myself, morning, nightly and weekly. I did all the things I set out to do.But around early evening things took a turn for the worst. The nukes began dropping in my head. You cannot stay like this, you will never achieve anything, you are not worthy of love, you are not even worthy of being acknowledged, you are a pointless enigma, you are hopeless, you will never be anything more than a failure, you cannot get it right, you will fall, you should just end this, give up, no one could ever love you, just end this, you cannot escape the pain, you cannot deny reality, you cannot do anything, you should just end this.Combined with the siphoning of the worth of my deeds, how pathetic my attempts were in reality, the pressure inside my head, my heart like a sack of stones. it is been present now for about 6 hours. I did manage to get myself to sleep for about 7 hours in there.But as soon as I awoke, those thoughts were right there, the heaviness in my chest, this overwhelming sense that I just cannot escape reality. That I have lost everything and I will always be bound to lose whatever I try to build.I try to remember my therapy tools. I try to just breathe, acknowledge how bad it hurts and just let it be. Try not to fight it. But it just keeps screaming inside that I am just an empty monster pretending to be human.Seems my depression was more than ready to strike me down. To try to convince me of how hopeless the remainder of my life truly is. All the things I have been forced to miss, things I cannot let go of. My children. How I failed them. All of this pain, all of the regrets, all of that loss. Just more nuclear bombs going off inside my mind. In all of it I wish I could just scream but I cannot. I wish I could cry but I cannot. The pain is so total, the destruction of my mind seemingly complete. As the fallout begins to rain down. I want to believe, this seperate entity from my mind, this ""me"". The fractures and fault lines seem to vast to repair. In all of it, I suppose I should at least be grateful that I have therapy in about 4 hours.Though I am not sure what I am really doing beyond wasting my therapist's time. It all feels so inevitable and I try to convince myself it will pass. I try to say maybe it is not as bad as my mind is making it out to be. I try to fight this war through kindness but I feel I am failing, just as I always have done. I can(t)",0

"A few months ago, I would be making yet another post on this subreddit. I was at my lowest. To get to that point of my life, the point of my life where I literally wanted to end it, I had years of social isolation, an adolescence scarred and stolen from me by bullying that left me with PTSD and being too scared to leave my own fucking house, being diagnosed with aspergers and depression, put on medication and coming literally to the edge of life and death. And you know what? I survived. I am a survivor. I have come to the realisation that there literally is nothing left in life that can frighten me. No height too high. No space too small. No flight too bumpy. No bully too big. I fear nothing, but fear itself. The thing that has scared me the most? My emotions. Being so traumatised, so low that I felt I had nothing to live for. Has anything changed? Not really. I still have no friends. I am still a confused, screwed up teen (well young adult I am 18 now), who'se still yet to experience anything you would expect from someone that age, still unemployed and still just as restless as ever. But what has changed? I embraced the mindset of a survivor. I stopped viewing myself as a victim. That is not to say I am a victim. I have been treated horiffically, an outcast by the society around me for my entire adolesence. But if I can survive years of loneliness, being bullied relentless for months on end, effectively imprisoned for fear of being attacked when I went out, night upon night of waking up in pools of sweat reliving the terror I experienced or might experience in the future, being on the edge of life and death, I can survive anything. This is the only positive thing I have posted on here. Probably one of the few positive things on here. My advice? Stop reading or posting on this subreddit until you are in a better place. it is filled with very angry, very desperate and sad people like how I was (and let us face it, I still have days like that), wallowing in an echo chamber where their worthlessness is projected to thousands of other like-minded people who believe that they too are equally worthless. If things have got that bad in your life that you thought about ending it, and you did not, then you are a survivor too. everyone is pain tolerance threshold is different, and if you did not give into that voice that told you you were better of dead, you have survived. My journey has only just begun. I am not sure where exactly the road I am on is taking me, but hopefully it is somewhere better than the place I have been at for the last several months. It might be a long, sometimes bumpy ride, but I will get there. One way or the other. Because I am a survivor. I am a survivor.",0

"I was having a dream about her. At first it was comforting seeing her, and talking to her like we were still together. I kissed her, and things took a wrong turn shortly after that. She looked at me and told me she was in love with him, and that she hated me. I kept begging her to please stay with me. She shook her head, and repeated the same lines over and over again. I woke up in a panic. Anxiety overcame me. I grabbed my spare key to my gun safe and pulled out my M9. I collapsed to the floor, and put the barrel to my temple. I flicked the safety off, pulled the hammer back, and closed my eyes. My finger slowly squeezing the trigger. The hammer fell and all I heard was a click. The pistol was empty. I opened my eyes and broke down. I began to think about that small hair of hope I was holding on to. But even that looks so hazy to me. Even though I survived that day, the desire to die has never left my mind. I feel like she knows how I feel, and is just waiting for me to die so I can stop being a problem for her. My latest attempt three weeks ago",1
"Last night i sat in my kitchen for an hour just wanting to get up take a knife and end it. I miss my old self, i feel myself getting toxic and feel super bad all the time.

And maybe it does. I just have not found it yet. I thought it was because I was scraping by and broke all the time. Now that I am doing ok money wise I feel like I have let down all the people who helped me out of that problem by being the same sleep for 13 hour sad sack who does not want to do anything or be around anyone. Money was not the issue. I think that no matter how much the world tries to normalize me I am going to always let everyone down and never be any different than what I am. I am here because of a google search of why am I not dead yet. I am scared to death of suicide but do not want to live. I feel like I am a disappointment to even the truly depressed. I cannot even be depressed right. To be honest I do not even know why I am typing this. Nothing helps. Nothing ever will. Doomed to work sleep and nothing else until finally I croak. Just wish it would hurry up. I got to go. Used to think depression had a reason,0
I hate myself its my fault I should have done more LOST ANOTHER PERSON TO SUICIDE!,1
"I mean why. Well you will die anyway someday, why you could die now if you want ? Why it is considered bad and insane. In the past in japan for example it was a normal thing to commit suicide to remove shame of yourself and even honourable. It is ok to kill yourself this day too for some kind of protest. Then why you cannot kill yourself just for nothing? Even if you are not suffering much. Just like i do not know as a form of shame. Like i just do not understand why is it that big deal. All humans will die anyway someday what does it matter if you die some years earlier or later. All times it was ok to have honourable death. Let me have it. I just see it now optimistically and not negatively. Like you fuck up, you die. I do not know how to describe it but i see it now very optimistically. Like i do not suffer that much, but still want to die for all things i fucked up. I see it as relief, as a salvation from all fuck ups. I know i will sound like a kid but it feels so cool for me. Like the same feeling when you watch a movie with a ""tough good guy"" as a main character, who even when he is tough, he has his code ( like do not kill children, do not stab in the back, give a chance do defend himself etc.). Like those codes seems cool. This thing feels like a code for me too, so that is why it feels cool too. Why is it bad to kill yourself",1
"I am feeling so hopeless right now and I do not have anybody to talk to. No one understands. I am just lazy to them, or dumb, or both. I did not work on my thesis like I should have and tomorrow I have to talk to my advisor. I am just laying there crying, feeling useless because I did not do anything the last couple days and now I have to write everything until tomorrow and its such an impossible task and I hate what I wrote until now and I will hate everything Ill write from there. I just hate myself and everything and I cannot stop crying and I really just need to pull a 20 hour shift of writing a thesis only for it to be utterly bad. Its already in the evening here and I have not done the bare minimum until now. What is wrong with me, why am I like this? I cannot concentrate anymore, I cannot focus to write such an amount of pages in such a short time. I completely fucked up. Again. I hate myself. I need motivation so bad right now but I just cannot find it. Its too late. I just need to vent",0
I read back something I wrote when I was 14 today. It described a pretty distressed and depressed kid. 7 years on from that all I can think about is the thousands of mistakes I have made in my life and how they could reflect on my family. I tried drinking but that does not seem to work. I have so much shame and guilt from years of sexting at a young age when I did not understand consent and age differences. I know I have stuff to live for but right now I cannot see any of it. Just wish I could escape,1
"Just to clarify, **I have never told anyone that I have wanted to die because of them, and I will never do something that in my life.**But... What I have done, having realized that yesterday, is something **very** selfish...In the past years, I used to tell some of the closest friends I have ever had about my feelings of suicide, like I felt sad, empty or than I wanted to catch the bus, including a time I engaged into self-harm once or twice, **(but I never told them it was because of them or something similar).** I also told the same things to people I used to know from the internet...What I did... Is **unforgivable.**I put such a huge **burden on them**, I think I made them feel they were responsible for my happiness... Even if that was not my intention, even if I tried to reciprocate things to them as much as I could; the **damage** was done.Those things should only be told either to qualified mental health professionals with decades of study, or in anonymous forums with people who have similar problems, but either the anonymity or professional relationship have boundaries to ensure the person who listens will not end up feeling guilty or responsible.Maybe that is the main reason I ended up being mostly alone... Even if I was desperate for help, I asked for it in the most horrible way I could have ever done...They moved on because they deserved to be happy, they deserved to be surrounded with positive people who love them, they deserved all the good things in the world...Something that a useless, toxic and cowardly person like me would never be able to provide... Even if I was hurt a lot, even if society ended up betraying me, I should have never asked that kind of advice to them... Honestly... I do not think I have ever been a good person at all... Ever since I was a child I have had trouble connecting with people, my way of being (like how I speak, walk and express myself), pissed them off so much that they ended up bullying me as punishment, or they slowly ignored me until I got the message and moved away from their lives.Heh, and I thought I could be a hero... What kind of hero does that?What kind of **decent** human being does something like that?Like someone told me once, even if I never had bad intentions towards them, my **final actions** were the ones that mattered the most.Aristotle said that there are friendships based either on affinity, utility and true love...Aside from some exceptions, I think most of the friendships I have ever had in my life were about utility and affinity, with very few ones based on true love...And if deep inside my core I am not a good person, it explains why I have to suffer like this as punishment. I think I have been a manipulator...",1

"There are certain people who I care for make me suicidal and generally like a failure. I would love some help just while I am stuck over the next few days. I recently started taking antipsychotics. They help me be more compassionate for my self. The situation is I have not seen a close friend in a long time and took 2 weeks off my 3 jobs to see them. They needed some help unpacking and with chores. But there is always something wrong. It does not help that there are sometimes feelings between us.The thing is I have done everything due to my people pleasing habits. And I have been thinking what I already knew, which is that I am doing this because of people pleasing. I could have spent my very limited vacation with friends who actually make me happy and should not have committed so much but I commit to people I care about and do a lot for those who reciprocate care as I have been deprived of it and had to grow up very early. But I had this need to please. But I have failed in various tasks and am now counting down the days I have to stay here as leaving will because more issues.it is not that this person is bad it is just how our anxieties play out and interact. And I recognize all my mistakes, in particular listening to the idea of staying with this person, and catering my schedule to do things for them and not doing all the things I wanted to do.I just need help surviving the next two or three days with any help or relatable stories. We have good times but a momentary issue ie if I do something too slowly or my two bags are visible out or bigger issues like messing up laundry (this was the biggest) or not waking up early or doing things based on their timeline(there are like 5 things I try to do in an afternoon and if I get 3/5 it is very bad) sends me down bad paths and I think because I am on medication I am feeling my feelings and hearing inner voices that advocate me more than I normally do. And the unpacking takes for ever but when they feel capable they do everything so well within a short time whereas I struggle immensely with even simple tasks because I always do them wrong and it is their space. I know I will never stay with them again or schedule a trip where I just see them. I just need help for the next few days and need to know if anyone else feels inadequate all the time or has made similar mistakes around certain people or dealing with people who are very particular.

"Hello everyone, I have only recently been seeing this change but it was concerning. I sometimes will try and think about my future plans and goals then just start crying, its kind of got me worried. I have been struggling in thinking about people who I care about and who I love.

"I am apparently a terrible person for joking about my depression as a coping mechanism.

Why does this have to be my coping mechanism",1
"I stopped drawing and reading regularly a few years ago. Two of my absolute favorite things to do since childhood. I am well into college now so the only reason I might draw is to finish an art project (I procrastinate an ungodly amount of time on projects anyway) I keep hoping my drive for it will come back but every time I try, I lose interest very quickly or get frustrated. I keep getting sucked back into these ruts where Ill feel numb and unmotivated and kind of hopeless for days. So Ill spend most of my time sleeping or doing nothing in my room. As an athlete, I do workout regularly but it never completely curbs these feelings away. But if I have a decent week, I think there cannot be anything wrong with me. Only for the cycle to continue. I just do not know what to do anymore. I hate feeling so miserable on and off. I am scared of the future because I cannot seem to do anything right for myself. I wish I could enjoy drawing and creating like I used to but I cannot imagine I ever will again. do not know if my passion will ever come back",0

"I have often passively ideated it, but I feel like I am sinking more &amp; more into active ideation where now I really do wonder if my story will end with me dying by my own hand. A huge part of me really really wants it all to be over because I am so tired of living in the US &amp; being part of the system, but another part really does want the story to get better. Like maybe I *can* leave the country &amp; end up doing something I love.I do not know if that is likely though. I think its super likely Id just end up sad &amp; alone. I do not really have family. &amp; all my friends have their own lives with lots of families &amp; other friends. &amp; I am so far out of the norm because I am not cis &amp; I am neurodivergent &amp; I do not even know much about falling in love because romance is a huge scary mystery to me that I just do not understand or really experience like normal ppl do. I like film studies though. &amp; I love helping people. &amp; I have had an excellent academic career so far (finished undergrad). Id really love to be a professor someday &amp; help students the way my professors have helped me. Id like to help make education more inclusive &amp; accessible. But its getting harder to be a professor these days. Grad school could be a lot more affordable in other countries, but I am not sure yet if there is even a film studies program out there for me that is still affordable. It might be a little bit too niche. A lot of the world is not friendly for nonbinary people. Its getting easier in some places, but its still hard. It makes me wonder if there is a place for me in this world when everything is the way that it is. I have friends who care about me, but even when I did reach out for help, so few answered. Only one sounded really genuine. I think everyone is tired of me. &amp; that hurts too. I do not think Ill be ending things quite so soon, but its always on my mind. I keep asking myself whether living is really worth it &amp; when, if not, will I finally initiate the final act? *Sigh.* I hate not knowing. I keep weighing the possible rewards of keeping my subscription to living against the relief of no longer having to pay for it. Even then, I still feel like I am in a trial period except I do not know when its going to end. When should I have a decision? I wish I knew! I wish it was easier. But who does not, though, am I right? Oh well. I feel like I am constantly deciding whether I am going to keep my subscription to life.",1
please anyone. i just want to be cared ab and loved. i have no one. no one cares until its too late and I am getting to the point where death seems better than this shit. no one thinks ill do it but when i do they will wish they paid more attention to it and they will wish they could have stopped it. i have no one. I have been having these thoughts since i was in 4th grade. I am now a junior in high school. people think I am a happy person and I am always okay but I am trying so hard to keep everything in. recently I have been giving so many warning signs that are so blatantly obvious i do not know what else to do. no one thinks you will do it until its too late.,1

"I just do not have it in me to care about people anymore. It takes to much work to love or hate. And for the most part people either do not care about me or have lied to me about caring. I use the firing squad test. If you tell me you love me, what are the odds you would chose to take my place at the bullet end of a firing squad? If the odds of that happening are laughably low, then you do not love me. You sort of care about me. I have learned over the last few years that this is what almost every person who said they ""loved"" me actually meant.So, I too chose indifference. Humans are humans, as other animals are other animals. I do not have the energy to care anymore. Let them play their stupid games. It is only if they get in my way that I will indifferently do what I need to do to enact my will. The only law is what I can get away with. I will forever be alone, but that is a small price to pay. It beats the alternative. Trust me, I am 46, divorced, and no longer speaking with the man I once called father. I know what I am talking about. The Age of Indifference",0

I go do the things I do not want to do anymore because ""hey, just push yourself to do shit and you will start feeling better."" But instead my anxiety skyrockets and I look like a fucking idiot who cannot even form a whole scentence. Then I start overthinking about how much of a fuck up I am and how stupid I must seem. So I just do nothing all the time so I do not fuck up. When I do that though I just get more depressed because I am being a lazy piece of shit.

Often I wish I could just get to the point where nobody likes me and I can finally die without causing pain to anyone.I mean hahaha, maybe Wellbutrin or a MAOI or ECT or rTMS will help.

Hi everybody. I was diagnosed with burnout/depression 8 months ago. The 4 first months I only took St-Jon's wort. Then 3 months of Lexapro up to 20mg which helped me but I was too spaced out so my psy switched me to Effexor for 3 weeks which were terrible. Then I asked for Brintellix because of the side effects profile. 1 month in and I feel not better at all.My Psy wants me to try Prozac now. Do you guys have success stories with Prozac after failure with many others ? I am starting to feel hopeless.. 4th drug.. I am loosing hope,0
"Had so much access to friends, different types of people, educational opportunities, and extracurriculars that are all gone now. I rarely talk to anyone from High School and I work the same terrible Job everyday. I work with idiots, do not learn anything new at work, and do not do anything fun outside of work. Why should I keep living this depressing life? you are going to tell me to do so so that you guys can benefit economically for my existence. I am 24 and I am still depressed that High School is Over!",1
"I am so fucking tired of being depressed. I have been depressed my whole life. My childhood was rough, I always had weight problems, no friends, etc. I think I am the most hideous person on Earth. I used to hate my self so much.I have never had a job I enjoyed. I always dreaded going to these shitty ass jobs. I bust my ass off for them, people tell me I am smart and good at my job but what is the point? there is no promotion no raise. I am stressing myself out working myself to the point of exhaustion for NO REASON. none of this matters it is all so stupid.I felt a glimpse of happiness last year when I got into my first relationship. I gave it my all. I made sacrifices for this person and they broke my heart. Cheated on me. Bullied me. I broke up with them but I still love and miss them so much. I do not see myself being in a relationship anytime soon. Sometimes i feel I will never be as happy as I was last year. Ever again.I am so tired of trying. But at the same time I am tired of being depressed. Its so not fair to end my life and kill myself and let all this bullshit win. Life is too fucking short to live like this all miserable. I am so tired of caring. I am so tired of trying to people please 24/7. Tired of these pointless jobs. I just do not care anymore.I am doing what makes me happy from now on. Imnot fucking busting my ass for this job anymore. While my coworkers are lazy and STILL GET PAID THE SAME AS ME LOL I want to be selfish for once in my life. I want to be happy and I do not fucking care who or what gets in my way I am going to do what I want. I refuse to let all this crap end me. there is so much pressure on us to be perfect. Have the perfect body and face, have a partner, have money, the perfect job. Omg fuck that its sooo stupid. Why do we even have to be those things.I had those things. I had the job the boyfriend had lost weight and I was still fucking miserable. Because I thought i had to follow other peoples idea of perfect and happy. To be happy. But it is such a lie. My idea of happy is different and I am going to find it. We are worth way too much to kill ourselves and lose to depression. Atleast I know i am. I am tired of fighting depression and distracting myself and hiding it from it. Imgoing to beat it bc i cannot do this anymore. I am done..",0

"TL;DR: Boyfriend is having trouble understanding I need space to work on my mental health, but always leads the discussions to how he is affected by my mental state. Am I the asshole? Title pretty much says it all. I have been having a really bad time with my mental health, I am trying my best to navigate it in life but it is very hard. I have done therapy and medications for years to alleviate the symptoms. My bf also has had extensive experience with his own mental health struggles so he is no stranger to it. My boyfriend is my rock, and has been for the 4ish years we have been together. he is helped me through a lot, and I have supported him through tough times too. We got engaged 1 year ago. he is the most important person present in my life, I do not have many people I trust. However, this time around my mental state has been possibly worse than it is ever been since we have been together. The last month it is caused a big rift and lots of arguments. I have barely had the energy to look after myself, and work is demanding for me when I can manage to go. My bf works a lot more than me, and always needs some attention or something for us to do together after a long day. He supports us a lot right now financially so of course I try my best to put in effort. But there are days I cannot manage to do anything at all besides lay in bed or stare into a book instead of focusing on the outer world around me, and he when that happens he gets upset that I do not give him attention or sit next to him on the couch while he watches t.v. at least. I have explained to him over and over, I am dealing with stuff, literally going day by day to try and not kill myself. But it always circles back to, what about HIS needs? What did he do to make me feel so bad? Did I talk to someone that triggered stuff, or did something happen to make the world fall apart??? What about all he does for me? Why am I not paying attention to him? Am I not grateful? All of this ultimately boils down to our past with issues of commitment, and the grand question of; Am I going to leave him?? I am trying my best to look after the needs of the relationship but I also need to focus on myself a bit more and my life outside of our relationship to try to not end up hanging myself.... is that so bad?? it is so exhausting... can I not be upset or have a bad day without it totally affecting him as well? I feel guilty for feeling like shit lately. Sometimes I think I should just leave so that he will go to therapy and become better for himself, I do not know if that is what I want or if that is my depression talking... I just do not understand or know what to do. I am tired of going in circles and I feel so guilty for it on top of everything. Am I being unreasonable, am I the asshole here??? Struggling to balance my mental health needs and my relationship",0
"I know people love me. My great grandparents, my dad, my little brothers, my mom, my cousins and aunts. My boyfriend. But I feel like no one loves me. And its so hard to explain to them because they do not understand. I feel suicidal sometimes and I wish I could do it, but then I think about my great grandparents and my brothers and how could I do that to them? I wish I had no one so I would not have to think about them. My boyfriend thinks I get depressed for no reason. But its not just one thing that sends me into an episode. Sure, its that one thing. But along with 50 other things that were on the back burner all hitting me at once. I just hate myself so much. I try not to compare myself to others, but once I do, I just start thinking about how much better everyone is and how I am wasting space just floating by. I wish I was never born. I start crying then my boyfriend just thinks here we go again.. He tries. But nothing helps except sleep and time. I am not motivated at all. I have no interests. I just scroll through social media. No desire for sex. And I know he deserves better. But he says he loves me. But another girl could treat him better. Be happy all the time. Want sex all the time. Not shut down and wish she was dead. I stress him out. I know it. I am just pathetic. Feeling so alone when you know people love you.",0
"I had a small group of fiends for years. Then it shrunk due to moving away and growing up and stuff. Finally my last remaining friend stole from me so I cut ties with him.

"I just realized I have been off my meds since June 29th, Because of my wisdom teeth surgery and other thingsLife is not as interesting or exciting as fantasies I create, its just disappointing. I constantly daydream or escape reality in my head. All the things I was interested in are just gone or I have mental will to do it. I do not play games cuz I get too tired or disinterested in it. I use to have a passion for cooking but I barely cook now. I am also overweight and I keep eating garbage even though I know I need to stop. I have been trying to stop but its like I cannot stop until after eating the shit. I started working and its a retail job ya know. Got tired of doing Jack shit and was feeling academically burnt out. Quickly learned i need to go and get a degree or skill. But nothing excites me fully, burnt out eventually or I am afraid of working hard due to how it led to my mental spiral for 2 years.I also ended a 10 year long friendship with someone who I also dated in the past officially. I thought I blocked them and would never hear from them again but there they were with a long message and their name. It gave me a panic attack and ruined my mood. Then I guess it kicked off my horrible feelings.I also feel broken. I am trans. People think its gross. I am not very good looking, fat, do not have a degree, I do not think I am very sexual or just asexual, I just know I have trauma from dating from the past. I have also just tired of the depression, anxiety, ocd, and whatever else going on. I am tired of the pills and having to remember taking them. I want a new brain or something. I do not plan on hurting myself. I cannot. My family already lost my cousin to it, and I just cannot do it on them again. But if I could never wake up, that would be great. I feel alone I think I live in delusion and nothing in life is as interesting as fantasy. I am scared of committing to anything and of working",1

"So, where to begin. I checked in on this profile which I have not done in ages, and saw my old suicidal posts from three years ago. If I would done that a year ago I would have been shocked to see how depressed I was. Now, that seems like an understatement. So, what happened? Well, it is the old story that keeps repeating itself, I managed to find a woman, we fell in love, I moved into her house pretty quickly because I was basically living out of my car at the time. She has a beautiful house in the countryside, with a huge garden and two dogs. I loved living there, finally feeling happy and at ease with myself. She encouraged me to go back to uni, and I did, and did pretty well. Even managed to get some new friends. Life was good. Then my grandmother died of cancer about 3 months into the relationship. I was devastated since we were very close. But I did not turn to drugs and alcohol like I would have in the past. Because I had her. She helped me through that trauma like a real trooper. Then summer came and it was the best summer of my life. While the whole world was going crazy over Corona, I was just mowing the lawn, playing with the dogs, and cuddling with the woman I love. We even started thinking of getting married. At my birthday party all my old friends were there and everyone seemed so proud that I would managed to get my life back together, and ""grow up"" so to speak. I started back at uni in the fall, and things went well. I managed through the skin of my teeth to pass all the courses. Christmas came, and she had to work, but at least we would get to celebrate New Years together. It was just us, but it was the perfect NYE celebration. I will not go into details because I will fucking kill myself if I think about how happy we were. New year, next level uni courses. I felt overwhelmed at the level required. I started slipping behind, but I did not tell her, I kept a straight face. Of course she found out I was lagging behind. I do not really know what happened next.I took her out for a Valentine's day lunch at a really nice restaurant, and from that moment, something felt off. She never said anything but I could feel it. She did not want to be intimate with me. She was just...not there. I could sense from that point that this was going in the wrong direction. I tried so hard to get her to communicate with me what was wrong, but to no avail. She started neglegting the house and just playing video games all day when she was not working. So I picked it up. Made dinner every night, did the dishes, all the housework, took care of the dogs etc. And kept falling further and further behind in school. It got to the point where I was so exhausted I just broke down and begged her to tell me what we can do to get back to where we were. No response. Then came the day I knew was going to come. She told me to get my stuff and get out. I had a week to find a new place. Her best friend was going to move in instead. And so, in two seconds my whole world fell apart. I was back where I was two years earlier, just older and with more student debt. Thankfully I had my family there to support me, but I was just in a state of shock. I knew we had our problems, but jesus christ, why could not we try to work through them? I certainly was willing to. So, I became homeless, again, reaching 30. Dropped out of school, lost touch with all my newfound friends, and moved into a dorm that has been remade into sorta like a halfway-house. I resisted at first, but of course I broke my two year sobriety now that I was back in my small hometown, where everybody knows everything. Now, I had no money, no job, no friends, absolutely hate living where I live, and have become a hermit. I am too ashamed to show my face around here. So, I take drugs, sleep all day, sit up wanting to blow my brains out every night. did not help that the police arrested me twice in a month either. So now they are probably going to repo my car, my most beloved belonging. I am not allowed to see the dogs, she is basically ghosted me, and I just cannot take the pain anymore. Every time I wake up a wave of utter despair and sadness washes over me. I live in filth, because who fucking cares. Nothing lasts in the end. And I have got rent due, car insurance, probably two fines around 1000$ each, and a drug habit once again. I do not want to play this game anymore, where we fool ourselves into thinking life is good, when tragedy is always lurking in the shadows. Dear God I wish I had a gun so I could just end this pathetic, miserable existence. I guess I will get some fentanyl and OD. Seems like the easiest way out. I have had a good life. Facebook keeps reminding me that 10 years ago I was backpacking through Asia with my best friends. 7 years ago I was living abroad having the time of my life. But since 2016, it is been pretty much nothing but downhill. And since I cannot get a job with a criminal record + crap economy overall, how TF am I supposed to get through this? Just get me a gun for Christ sake. I cannot take it no more. See ya on the other side, where there is no more pain. If only I had a gun, or could get one, I would not be here today",1
"I was feeling extremely, extremely ready to do it today. I was sitting on my floor sobbing because I had a ptsd flashback yesterday and all the friends I was with just left me. It was already terrifying and I have abandonment trauma on top of it, so them doing that made me spiral. Today I called my childhood best friend who I have been close to for over 20 years now, and he basically said I told you so and that its my fault because I do not want to move back to the city so I have access to better people and better friends.Then I reached out to my second best friend who I have known for around 6 years now and even lived with at one point, and asked him if he could come over because I was having a crisis and did not think I should be alone right now. His response was My girlfriend and I just went tubing and were tired I told my brother I was suicidal a few weeks ago and really needed his support and he told me hes too busy working and to give him 2-3 more years so he can buy a house. He does not even have any bills right now. He still lives in an apartment through foster care and could easily request less hours since he voluntarily picks them upEvery single friend I interacted with knows I have PTSD and am majorly depressed. Three of them know I am suicidal.Lmao everyone says if you are about to kill yourself to reach out and talk to someone but when you do, you get blown offLike I talk about how nobody actually cares about me and people scoff and act like there must be SOMEONE. No, there is literally nobody. I do not have parents, my brother is my only family and those few friends I have just do not give a shit. Literally my cats are the only thing keeping me here Everyone always tells you to reach out to someone if you are suicidal, but then when you reach out people do not want to deal with you.",1

I hope in my head people will hurt for me. Tho I have my doubts with that as well. Hence it being just a shit fantasy. I wish I had told them I loved them maybe things would have not ended here.

"Currently in a meeting at work. Going through a bad tick right now of negative feelings (very common for mehave highs and then super lows) but as far as most people are concerned, nothing is wrong with me because I do not show viable symptoms. I wish I could flip the switch back to good mood time so badly but I just sit here constantly telling myself bad things about myself with serious apathy and hopelessness while trying to keep composure at work. I know physical pain can because depression, too, but at least you can vent a little without people thinking your just sad and the shit in your head causes 0 pain. I have basically resorted to writing what I am feeling in my Notes app in my phone because its the only time I feel like I can say how I am actually feeling without feeling like someone thinks I am just over exaggerating or feel bad for even complaining about anything.

I have given up on asking for advice on how people live their lives because everyone says the same fucking thing every time you just have to get out of bedyou just have to find a hobbytalk to someone Like do people actually have high hopes for life or is everyone just lying to each other to make them feel better?

"I suffer from Generalized anxiety disorder, ""slight depression"" (as dubbed by my pediatrician, I just have higher expectations of this), and what I think to be neurosis or maybe even ADHD or some random ass compulsive disorder my family is aware of but I am not.I am driven and infatuated by what is in my stupid-ass brain. I valued and still to an extent still value my intellect over and above other things and factors of my being which now I do not say is good and healthy. I once had a prolonged period of heightened self conscious awareness where I felt like I was the one in controll of my thoughts even when I was just being an asshole narcissist that went as far to screw up my brain chemistry and composition from all of the stress and anxiety I subjected myself to (which is funny because I had hypochondria of getting brain damage or neurological damages and it still probably happened). Now that the feelings I felt during that time are gone, and I wanted them back for a while, I questioned and interrogated myself, my family, and my morals all for the feelings of being superior again cognitively. Now, about 5 months after this. I feel some of the same indifferences and feeling I had then, but I feel like my day is just learning something, trying to apply the knowledge, fail, then realize I am stupid again. My realization that I cannot go back to those addicting tendencies because I am limited on my intelligence has made me realize I am not smart and that I am a retard. I remember when I could easily think, then say. Now it is, think, say awkwardly, think again, then say it in a idiotic way. I need help because everything I am repeating I have thought of before and I am just in an endless dilemma of questioning reality in a way that I feel is not noticable enough to put into verbal words because I have most likely developed aphasia.

He does not have depression, and cannot relate to how I feel, I have told him a few times how life feels, but not really told him anything in detail about the thoughts and feeling that go through my head everyday. He is honest (which I appreciate), and tells me that he just does not really understand if I say anything like that.

"I just moved states with my partner- they had a great job offer, and I am still finishing my masters, so we headed out with plans Id get a bartending gig. And I did, for about a week, before I was fired for not being a good fit. The wording definitely stung. I immediately spiraled, panic attack, going wide with my failures (cannot keep a job, cannot do anything right, etc). My partner was great and supportive, but its hard to crack that nagging voice of worthlessness in the back of my head. I am good at my job, so being fired for what I can only assume is a dislike of me in particular feels... devastating. I want to be a writer. I am working on my thesis for my masters. Yet losing a job I have had for less than two weeks has leveled me, and its hard to see any value I bring to my relationship, society etc if I cannot keep a fucking bartending gig.

"I realize most of this is highly subjective to everyone, but I am sure at least one of these points will sound familiar. - You can no longer just walk into a video store and pick out something that looks cool. With sites like Ebay, or amazon, it takes away the social aspect. - You cannot have deeper, meaningful time with family, or friends, because everyone is always updating their life on social media and nobody cares about what is going on around them anymore. - To follow that, everyone lacks discipline and attention spans. - Malls used to be a cool, fun place to meet friends, but with corporate giants like Amazon...well, you see the issue. - People seem to have a very hard time staying on topic. Social media has created positive feedback loops that encourage one to spout opinions and tell stories instead of further the conversation. People now crave one-sided conversations because they need the validation of their life story being ""liked."" - Depression...itself. I feel like social media romanticizes, and makes fun of people with depression a bit. I can go on and on for another hour, but these ones stand out to me the most. The internet is a very useful tool, and not the actual issue. The problem is that social media takes away the connection we used to have to each other, and for me, I feel like if I had more connections with people outside of the internet, my life, as well as many other's, would be much better off. I think the reason I have depression, as well as many other people, is because society is ruined due to social media taking away real emotions from people.",0

"Hi (24F) here, I am not sure how to explain it but does anyone else get Anxious and then depressed when spending time with people? Example: my husband talked me into going out to dinner with his colleague and her husband, they were delightful and I was having a pretty good time until I started feely anxious, I could literally feel the knot in my stomach and it went on for a good 30 min and then I became depressed, I wanted to crawl into a hole and just die, I kept acting like everything was normal, I was not having any negative thoughts at the time either, now that I am home the feeling will not go away but I know it will be gone by tomorrow, I have done this ever since I was little (6), my mother had to pick me up multiple times from sleepovers because of how bad it was, also if we went on vacation I would also become anxious and depressed from time to time, and I have never been diagnosed with depression or have had it, it is just when I am social or traveling, I am not sure how to explain it to my husband because he gets frustrated I am not as social as he is, I feel like I am crazy does anyone else experience anything like this??

"I lost my mom then 45 days later I lost my 12 yr old son. My mom was sickly. she would told me she was tired. In the hospital, she had rallied. We thought she would be coming home. Then she did not make it. My son was extremely grief striken. I realized he was not ok. I sent him to therapy. 3 days later, he was gone. I found him. My only baby. I went to the store and when I got back, I found him. He is everything to me. And, life is not worth living without him. I have to see everyone else's children grow and reach milestones. But, not my child. I die inside more and more each day. 3 months after He left me. I could not take it. I failed and wound up in the psych ward for a month. That was in 2019. I am struggling to keep it together and continue to appear ""ok"". I know my biggest fear is that if I succeed I may never be reunited with him in heaven. But , it is almost worth it to not have to live without him. he is my baby. I also do not want anyone else to feel what I am feeling. But, most days, I just pray God will just be finished with me. I have been in a really bad place the last few days. I know I need help. But, I feel like I have no place to turn. I feel alone in pain and I am tired. Safe Haven",1
Just curious because everything just says they help elevate your mood but that is very vague. I struggle more with a thought of meaninglessness of my life. It feels less like a feeling and more like an awareness. Just wondering if antidepressants would actually prevent me from thinking this or if its more of a thing I need to just do some therapy for? Thanks and sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Would an ssri help me?,0
"Yeah that is about it . I know I have made a comment or 2 in the past I am sure about it but Recently I realized though that I have sorta become an asshole with it.. not too proud of that one. Ill throw things like alright, well I am going to go eat a bullet now or sure lemme just go walk into traffic first into my daily life without even realizing what I am saying or to who (my mother). To me thinking about it and fantasizing various ways to do it have become soothing in its own morbid way but that is no reason for me to throw it out there so much. I have also noticed i have no real inner monologue too anymore thoughts do not seem to stay up there where they belong and just kind of come out without any regard to how others may feel about it. Idk, maybe I am just slowly going crazy.

"Hey there folk, friendly neighborhood rant here. cannot promise it will be reader-friendly in terms of like formatting or timeline, but I will try my best. That being said, here goes.&amp;#x200B;Okay so this whole thing starts when I was about 11, mormon, living in California, and my parents were getting divorced. My mother left me with my father, who was too depressed to even get out of bed, for 2 weeks. She comes back for my sister's wedding, and we move to Indiana. In Indiana, my mother and my other sister (s2) decide that they are going to ""co-parent"" me more or less. S2 is pretty much just unlikable in every way. She is the type of person to gaslight you into thinking you are not depressed (we will get to that). Then, after about a year or two in that living situation, the ""Strawberry Incident"" occurred. This is when S2's mother asked me if I felt like cutting some strawberries, and I replied that I did not. I was then forced to do muscle failure for a week straight. After that occurred, I began to realize that the family I have may not be the best for me. Fast forward to about a year later. My father moves out to live with S2. One day, I was getting back from a temple trip to Indy and I had a confrontation with S2. I told her how I felt and said I was not sorry. I then went to talk to my father and he called me a ""Selfish Cocksucker"". That one always stuck. Flash forward one more year, and I am in 8th grade. I am having trouble mentally and had planned my own offing. I was going to do it the night of a concert for my school band. A teacher ended up finding out and told my mom. She then turned it into me trying to actively harm her. I was then sent to a mental hospital wherein I was sexually assaulted by my roommates. When I get back, S2 tells me that I was not really depressed because she would have known. &amp;#x200B;\-INTERMISSION-Hey there here is a little break from the madness. I hope you are having a good day. Anyways, let us dive back in.\-END OF INTERMISSION-&amp;#x200B;After that, I have a pretty uneventful time up until about the end of my freshman year. I had ended up overdosing on my antidepressants and told my best friend, W. Me and W went into a stairwell and we called the crisis hotline, thinking it would be the last call I make. W and I had planned to sing ""Wonderwall"" in our school's talent show. I had ended up being hospitalized again before being able to preform with him. I still feel terrible. Later on, I was with my mother in a taco bell drive thru, and the only thing I remember her saying is ""Why should I care about you when you treat me the way you do."". After a few weeks, cue a family party. I was on an LGBT site that I used to frequent (I think it was a mightynetwork site, I do not really remember all that well.) and also doing my schoolwork. S2 looks over to see what I was doing, and I showed her my schoolwork. She got suspicious of me, and asked to see my iPad. I refused, not wanting her to find out I was a member of the LGBT. She then escalates it, and we end up outside. I tell her that she is an active contributor to my depression, and she says that I do not have it. The next parts are extremely hazy, but I do remember her pushing me to the ground. I still refuse to give her my iPad password, so she threatens to call the police. In retrospect, I still would have kept it from her. After that, my brother in law ends up getting it from me and looks through my profile, finding out that I was Abrosexual. He then laughs at me, and offers me a cigar and beer to ""cool off"". Fun stuff. So after those events, I just cry myself to sleep and that is that. W ends up moving to the next town's school for our sophomore year and beyond. I have a new confidant, D. D and I go to the school counselor together to try to fix my living situation, and I am eventually told to go to the office one day. My principal, thinking I was in a gay relationship with D, called me a ""sick bastard"", and changes mine and D's schedules, so that we no longer have classes together. Somewhere along that timeline, in my freshman year, my dad dies. I am forced into sitting in a hospice room, awake, with my dying father for 12 hours. Flash forward to now. Going into my senior year. I am scared of letting anything show to my mom and getting hospitalized and not being able to go on my germany trip next year. I just want to know what to do. Please. :,)",0

It sounds so nice. Screw my family getting sad or something -- I will not even be there to grieve about the sadness I caused them because I am 6 feet under. Honestly, at this point I am so tired of keeping up with everything. I am tired of forcing myself to manage my emotions all the time. I forgot what it is like to *not* have to remind myself to keep a positive attitude. I forgot what it is like to actually .. have a purpose? To have something to look forward to in life?Really, I am just going through the motions now -- and I am sick. I am so so sick and tired.

"And I know this. I have noticed it for a long time. My depression is twofold. On one side, it is from years of torment in a private school. Once I escaped that, the second phase kicked in when I realised I would be single/lonely. . .For a while. That was 25 years ago. The torment/harassment I went through, I can get through. Ppl are assholes. . .The lonely/longing phase, does not get better. 2 months ago, I ran into a classmate of mine (from the school I actually liked going to). We were not friends then. We did not know each other. We only had one class together. And, even though I found her intriguing/attravtive, I never talked to her. After graduation, I would run into her from time to time, at the bars. I actually admitted to her that I was interested back in high school, but was too scared to talk to her. The last time I saw her, we were at a bar, and we got caught up. She had plans (that I did not want her to do), and she did not want to ""continue"" the evening.TL;DRI ""thought"" I saw a classmate of mine a couple months ago. We were/are on the same page, that if I see her, I will not recognize her her, due to my bad vision at range, and only seeing her every 5 or so years. This time was different, as I have new glasses, and she walked up to me and said my name. I was under enough stress, anxiety, emotional problems, that I ligetimatly, thought I holusinated her. I have not seen her since. And my depression, of being single for so long has me thinking about her.sucks. . .Back on topic. I have noticed that things that I have had interest in. . . I no longer remember.I hate knowing that I am losing my mind, when I can see it happening. Loosing my mind",0

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything.

Maybe it is a good comparison.

"it is crazy to think how many people undervalue the significance of a family that genuinely cares and looks after them. A father that is not a selfish psychopathic lunatic, a brother that is not a delusional sociopathic prick or a mother that is an irrationally fragile creature. Imagine being stuck in the same house for almost 18 years with nowhere to go, no freedom, no rights, no dignity, no respect, no nothing. No friends to hang out with, no relatives to call on, no girlfriends to talk to. I have been subjected to physical, mental and emotional torture and abuse from a very early age both at home and school. Every waking moment of my life is nothing but filled with despair, sorrow and guilt. Misfortune after misfortune, failure at every waking step. If that was not enough I also suffer from extreme emotional trauma, PTSD, depression, anxiety disorder....the list goes on. I cannot even put into scale the level of emotional breakdown I endured as an 11 year old all the way through now, all of those years and I never had a therapist or counsellor. You are probably wondering why I never called one. Well the thing is I just cannot and the reason for that is because my father happens to be the cheapest mf on this planet. This guy does not spend any money on anything whatsoever rather then buying groceries and essential home restorations or articles. He saves each and every penny just for his pension, that is all he cares about. I cannot even report for abuse or neglect since he is extremely manipulative and a drama queen. He would simply spin the narrative around to blame the whole thing on me backed by my brother and mother. Why would anyone even believe me since I am only a kid. I cannot go anywhere, I cannot do anything; there is no one to help me. There is just hopelessness and self loathing from the moment I rise in the morning to the moment I retire to bed, the same cycle, the same shit. Every day, every week, every month; nothing changes. I cannot even fathom how I have not gone insane after all this shit. There was so much I wanted to do in life, discover and explore, find a meaning or purpose, get married, have kids, maybe even do some volunteer work. it is all in vain now, everything's a waste. Nevertheless it does not matter anyway, I am not looking for some sympathy or consolation or anything, that phase has already passed out ages ago. Anyway.... thanks for reading my post, I am really glad you took the time to come all the way down here, it is probably the most someone has ever done for me. Keep thriving... A life well lived",1
...cannot be good for me. Most days I barely move my body at all. I have no hobbies and no duties or responsibilities. My muscles are surely atrophying slowly. There is no reason to get out of bed.

"In the beginning of my new career of 6 months I finally cracked and cried at work. Dr. A who was scheduled for that day was not in so I was suggested to ask Dr. B if he would be available. He asked me why I came to him. I explain and I say I can find another doctor since he is busy. He sternly tells me no. I readily give him the info and history I had prepared. He is short with me so I insist I can find another dr. as I do not want to interrupt his work. He looks me in the eye and says he will do it. We begin to leave his office &amp; he says Alright, you are keeping me away from this little girls CT. I do not want to upset him further so I do not say anything and we continue to the exam room. The exam we were doing has straightforward objectives but each radiologist has different preferences on supplies and machine settings. Let me say again I have never worked with this doctor before and although I had all the supplies I needed at hand, opened or ready to be opened, I did not expect him to be so particular. Down to the medicine cup. Each step of the exam that I have done multiple times before with other doctors with no problem, he was micromanaging, breathing down my neck, impatient, and frustrated. I am rolling with the punches. He is the doctor, this is his expertise, and I deliver what he wants with the best of my ability bc patient care and a thorough exam is always what is most important. 99% of the time I take work pressure objectively. Specifically this dr. is a dinosaur in the field, so of course he has his own way of doing things. He experiences intense pressure every day and is understandably not going to be rainbows and unicorns. Maybe he was having a bad day. But this time was the 1% I could not mentally handle the pressure and his attitude and tbh the assholery. The exam ended. It was successful. He managed to have small talk with the patient and I to maintain a semblance of bedside manner. He left the room. It was only until when the patient mentioned how mean he was towards me was when I fucking started crying. I always remind myself everyone is going through something. The doctor. The patient. Colleagues. Everyone else at the hospital. I am constantly struggling with my mental health from past trauma. And I just could not hold it in together long enough. This has become a massive wall of text. Thanks if you read all of it, I do not have anyone to vent this to Taking it day by day",0
"Even when I am distraught, I can never get the job done (suicide). My mind is exploding. I am under so much stress with no outlet, no relief. I already called the police after the incident. They did not do much, and one of them was extremely hostile towards me, which triggered me further and left me in tears when I was already traumatized by what happened. I am in so much pain. I have no support. I live alone and am disabled due to my mental health. I do not know what else to do. I am desperate for assistance, even if only a little. I understand the Internet is not a good place to seek support, but it is my only option. I have called my case manager. I have already called the Crisis Hotline, the National Suicide Hotline, and the Samaritans Hotline. They all tell me the same thing: to get a therapist, but the waitlists are long, up to six months. I need immediate help now. I need someone now. Does anyone know anything, or anyone, that could provide some sort of relief? Please, someone do something. Please read this. I need help, and the police did not help me.",1

The fear of embarrassing myself for being different, the fear of getting scolded by my parents for embarrassing them. My feelings never matter in that situation. I do not know what it is like to be worthy of love and compassion because I never receive such unconditional love. I always have to be something else that I am not, to avoid shame and punishment.

It gets to me sometimes, I have never cut but I have gotten really close, sometimes I will take a dull knife and run it across my wrist to feel the adrenaline.

I do not see the color in the world anymore, everything is just black and white. I wish I could have stayed 12, when everything was amazing and I would go to school with a smile, and my face would light up when I see my parents or my sister, when I would play basketball for hours on end with my friend.

"When I was barely over the age of one, cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say, I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child, eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though, I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child, which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption, sadly though, the parents who had adopted me, had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids, while occasionally we would see our dad. Though, my mother would rarely let me see my father. It was obvious from the start, I was different from other kids. I look back on it, and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment, I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help, my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD, but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love, would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get, she would not allow me inside, and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside. Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex, and my father who was extremely strict, grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person, and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more, I went back and forth between my mom and dad, eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression, but as soon as I became an adult, I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family, who I have Always had a rocky relationship with, and was always shut down and told to stick it up. They ignored my pain and suffering, and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back, she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible. He deceived me into believing he was someone else, and like an idiot, I feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt, and now I find myself the lowest I could ever be. I have no motivation and I know I just cannot keep doing it anymore. I am tired, and I do not care to live. I do not care what happens after this, I just want to be set free from this misery. I also cannot help but resent my father, he has so much money yet he refuses to help anyone. He says to work hard, even if it means work 24/7, since he is an alcoholic. But I just struggle so much, and the fact that he is out there spending ridiculous amounts of money on the dumbest of stuff, but not on helping out his child that is struggling so much, who finally admitted to him that I have been suicidal.I have come to realize that all the abuse I went through as a child, has damaged me in a way that I can never hope to be normal. I still have a speech impediment, but I have learned to become the silent character. I know that I have some form of autism, I have looked up all the signs and I have worked so hard to understand myself. I do not want to be here anymore, and I guess really, I just want to be heard.

"I know there are people I care about who would miss me if I died, who would blame themselves for the rest of their lives, but it is so hard to care.So hard to care when I think about how when I am dead, I will not have to witness it. It will be impossible for me to care when I am dead. This is heightened even more because I do not believe in an afterlife. To me, when I die, the world simply will not exist anymore, because I will not be around to witness it.Even if I have things to look forward to in this life, things that excite me, it is still so hard to care. So hard to care when I know none of this will matter anymore to me if I died. I live at a parents house, and I have no possible means of killing myself right now. I do not imagine I will until I am an adult and completely on my own. But I do not want to grow up at the same time.I am only a she will of the person I used to be, without my art it feels like I am nothing anymore, but I cannot draw.I hate seeing I cannot even get the motivation to watch tv.I cannot get over any of my habits unless it is forced upon me.

The government will not do anything for me unless I drag them by the fucking ear and I do not even have enough energy to get out of bed.Whenever I get my hopes up something happens to destroy them and send me spiralling into new depths I did not even know existed.I am starting to think this world exists just to torture me.I was cursed from before I was even born to be miserable my entire life.

Or maybe a sick joke that I do not have the courage to do it.I do not want to die, but I physically cannot enjoy anything. it is a herculean effort to pull myself out of utter misery into a state of mind approaching normal. And the world moves so fucking fast in the meanwhile that by the time I work up the energy to do anything I am bombarded with dozens of urgent tasks and responsibilities that wear me out in no time.And on top of a defect in my brain that prohibits feeling joy or satisfaction, and on top of living in a shitty cruel world that is barreling toward destruction due to equal parts stupidity, selfishness and malice. On top of that, I am trans. How fucking cursed can I be?I am not even sure what I am.I am not even sure if it is real, or if it is an attempt at escaping who I used to be. The person I hate. If it is maybe just grasping at straws. Throwing every fucking thing at the wall and hoping something works. Maybe I am so wrapped up in a thousand different insecurities that I have convinced myself I am trans, or maybe I have tricked myself into thinking I am not.Maybe it is a combination of all that and my hatred for men and myself.I just want the pain to stop. I just want to feel joy. I just want to be sure of anything. Please someone fucking help me. I am so tired of misery and melancholy. Fix me or fucking shoot me I am such a fucking piece of shit. there is no escaping my fate.

Nobody will take you or your problems seriously unless you actually kill urself like.its the same as how traffic engineers will not install a crosswalk until a certain number of pedestrians *die* at a certain location even if its well-traversed. I feel like a lot of the factors that lead me to be suicidal are systemic but nobody cares about suicidal people or people suffering from addictions until we *die*. Sometimes I feel like I need to like you know take one for the team? Maybe somebody will give a fuck about climate change or affordability? or healthcare? or burnout or overwork? or financial instability? Worst part of being suicidal is that nobody really cares if you *do not* do it,1

"Idk who goes through what in their lives but just tell me if you have ever felt this, the way i did cuzz i just want to know people are facing the same shit as me or am i really the 1 in a million as my doctor said once to me. I had the worst night in my life and what happened today it happen before too but it was like rarely so for me this was not a big of a deal. I always keep my phone far away from me when i sleep like above me and when i need something in the night usually i do not but in case i do then sometimes my hand would reach out to the phone and sometimes it will not reach, or sometimes i would just yell and someone would come. Last night i got in a very uncomfortable position while sleeping and normally i would come back to my sleeping position but idk why i could not move myself forward it is not just my legs it is my whole body that does not work and I have been in this place before, i remember when i could raise my hand and one day i could not, there was a time when i used to walk and then i could not even stand, or when my internal organs started failing. Okay so what is next now? My voice i guess cuzz in the end vocal cords are also muscles and I have this disease Muscular Dystrophy so my every muscle in my body is going to die so i will not be able to speak in some years well that is too bad cuzz everybody says I am very talkative. Sometimes I have the strength and sometimes I am a person who cannot even move a little by herself. So I am like yah whatever let us just call someone to help me out so i tried to get my phone but i guess it was my lucky day my hand could not reach to the phone then i tried shouting no one could hear me they were all in their room sleeping. I was not able to sleep leave that part what is the worst was, cuzz of the uncomfortable position in which I was my leg started to pain so badly and all i wanted was to get out of this pain i shouted for like 2 hours straight still no one could hear me that moment i cannot even explain how i felt... how weak, how hopeless these words are not even enough for me honestly it straight up felt like a cruel torture like i was in a hell and i kept wondering why is this happening to me? What did i do? WHY ? why someone would put me in this miserable life, in this almost dead body who does not have any strength to even move a little, is this you call living? No i think for me the living is dead.After 2 hours my mom woke up and she said from now on keep your phone close to you while sleeping. In my head i was like yah i will keep my phone close to me from now on but what about the fact that I am dead? Or maybe i died again in those 2 hours and maybe I will die like this someday again!. Whoever sees me may call this life of mine living but if you are not sitting in my wheelchair then i do not think you know how i feel. I will try to explain you how it feels like to sit in my wheelchair... I was very little when me and my family got to know that I have this disease called muscular dystrophy and there is no cure for it in the whole world even Stefan Hawkins had this disease not the exact one as mine cuzz this disease I have, it has many types but they are all quite similar. I was born with this disease but it can come to its real form in any age of your life in your 20s or in your childhood nobody knows so you see I was a normal kid back then I used to go to school I had this many friends and I was also the prettiest among everywhere I go and now it is all gone my beauty, my friends, my normal life idk what is left in me now. It has been 9 years since I have been bedridden. My brain, heart, lungs, my facial features and my senses, back bone, fingers, voice, and a little bit of hand movements these all things which I have mentioned only these things work for now other than anything in my body which I did not mention is dead, like for example my legs and my digestive system. I am very thin, the kind of thin that I bet you have never seen before cuzz of loss of muscle in my body, my coller bones are unusually deep, it is like my bones are super visible and when I say I look like an alien I mean it. You know I can keep on writing about my problems cuzz there are so many and believe me these are all the minor ones i have not even started talking about the bigger ones I just do not know what to do with this life it is like there is no control no certainty about my life or neither of my death I am just stuck in a middle of nowhere where I just wake up everyday to have 10 kinds of different pain in my body and despite having them I have to live as a happy person cuzz nobody likes a person who is depress all the time.

"I (M18) have struggled with depression and other things my whole entire life. I was born to a mother who would end up resenting me because I did not cure her problems and fix her marriage, someone who would do absolutely everything in her power to make me feel horrible and change into what she wanted, one bad friendship after the next, crippling loneliness, painful dysphoria, and a horrible view on the world (I love people but humanity is something). I would say there is a line between feeling all the pain of your life but not enough to change it and the point where enough is enough and you decide to fix your life. I am right on the edge. I feel extreme pain nearly every single day from whatever trauma and illnesses I have but I cannot for the absolute life of me get any sort of drive. I have absolutely no desire or driving force to get a job or career, I cannot bother to get my license because of lack of drive and fear surrounding it, and I cannot leave my room to socialize with friends. I have no relationship with my family, a father that does not care about me and is absent from my life, and a mother who is constantly around to remind me of how much of a disappointment I am to her, and how she regrets having me. From every point leading up to now, I cannot look back on my life and say I am happy to be alive There are times where I want to rot away until I am frail and sickly, or times I want to whore myself out for any kind of attention and joy, while most of the time I wish it would just be over. I do not want to die, but it seems like the only option I have left. there is no kind of life that appeals to me, and any drive to get better has been sucked out of me no matter how much I wish it did not. I do not want to die but I am afraid its the only option I have left. Advice on how to enjoy life and move forward? How to get the drive to make life better and keep living?",0
"I cannot bear the thought of taking my own life, the enormity of nonexistence is terrifying enough that I cannot do it to myself. I have tried now and then, starting when I was a kid, but could not do it. But I hate my life. it is constant illness and pain both mental and physical that leaves me basically crippled unless I am high on speed, and I have been out of amphetamine for several weeks now due to shipping delays. And for perhaps a few weeks or months a year I start doing better, but every time circumstances beyond my control find a way to fuck me up the arse. I wish I could be dead without having to kill myself. Just rest in absolute nothingness without ever knowing that the sum total of everything I know is soon to disappear. Hopefully I am struck dead by a brain aneurysm or a runaway car sometime in the near future. In the meantime I do whatever drugs I can get my hands on, sleep, and try to make sure I at least shower once every few days. I am trying so hard to do more but right now that is all I can do. I do not want to kill myself, I just wish I were dead.",1

And that is all.do not make fun of me. do not make jokes about my mental illness. Not even the most subtle ones.Understand me.

Give me my freedom. do not patronize me. do not think you know me better than I know myself. do not think you always know what is better for me than I know what is.

And then they leave you by yourself while they flit from group to group socializing, not handling hosting duties.The only time I feel comfortable mingling is when there is a game or another loner I can approach, but no one plays games anymore and nowadays we loners are old enough to just leave, so there are not any anymore except for me. Its VERY rare to have someone approach a loner so I try to be that person, even though I have very very seldom been on the receiving end of such a gesture. If I join a group conversation, I am treated like an invasive weirdo. Never addressed with words, only glances and glares.It kills me that people are just cool with me being by myself.

"I will set the scene a little here to give a little backstory. Two weeks before I found out about my wife I found out that my grandmother has cancer in her bones that has metastasized to several other locations. A week before I found out about it I lost my job at locksmith. It was the first job I have ever had that I looked forward to doing every day. With three days to go before I found out I learned that my uncle who I have been close with my whole life also has late stage cancer of the lung. To top it all off these were the weeks leading up to finals. I logged in to my computer and my wife had left Facebook open. I would normally not snoop but she would been acting very off and I saw she had a new message from two different ex's. that is how I found out that she had cheated on me/was still cheating on me. it is been a month and we still live in the same house. it is been fairly amicable with no lawyers needed. I am absolutely a wreck, I do not know what to do with myself anymore. I have not signed up for another semester of college. The only job I have had was two weeks at an awful manufacturing facility and I could not even make myself stay there. My ex has already started dating again. I just do not know what to do with myself anymore. With that in mind, does anyone have any trip destinations or advice? it is not like I have got anything better to do and I Need to get away from here for awhile. I am in the southeastern US but driving basically anywhere is not a problem and there is always the possibility of flying.

I know I am socially inept, but I do not know what I did to deserve this level of loneliness. Tonight is the worst I have ever been. And that is really saying something. I Just Want Someone To Talk To.",1
"I know some people that want to live and turn their life around because they want to. But I just do not, I do not want to do anything that might help me, I do not WANT to take care of myself, eat right, or go to therapy. How do I get to the step of even wanting to wanting to actually want to take care of myself? I am so over this bull, this probably does not make sense but it makes sense in my head. How do I make myself want to live?",0
"I get nostalgic when thinking of when I was depressed and into dark things so I start over again. I actually feel at my best when I am depressed and more confident which is weird so I do not know if it is normal or not. I would rather stay like this than be happy because I feel like when I am actually happy in my life, my feelings are all bottled up and I feel stiff but when I am depressed, I feel totally at peace and a sense of calmness. Like I am truly myself. This probably makes no sense but I thought it was somewhat weird? Why do I miss the feeling of depression?",0
"I have been (passively at best, actively at worst) suicidal for more years (14+) than I have not been at this point. It feels like a cancer that I just cannot cut out, no matter what meds I take or what positive life changes I make. When I go to bed at night or take depression naps I cannot help but think of how nice it would be if I died in my sleep. I beg the universe for it sometimes. Especially with the trajectory of the world.And if I am not supposed to die then I wish that life could just pause for a few seconds. I am struggling to breathe, and its maddening not having adequate space to even attempt to work through these awful feelings. How do I tell my job, friends, family that my daily performance is suffering because I wish I was dead? How do I provide for myself if I am in long-term treatment? Rent does not go away. Responsibilities will pile up. I am so worried that if I acknowledge how bad things are and try to seek help that my life would only get worse and that it would be impossible to claw myself out of that hole.People expect you to keep going like nothing is the matter if you give them the PG version of your thoughts, or they start treating you like you are crazy if you are too honest with them.And there is no way I could responsibly start a family like this or accomplish any of lifes basic milestones. I worry that adoption agencies would flag me in an instant if I tried getting help. I cried for hours today just thinking of how irresponsible Id be getting a dog and dragging it down with my mood, let alone putting a partner or kid through this misery. These basic things feel so unattainable, and that is killing me.I feel like there is no way to win while keeping my pride intact, and I am starting to get tired of trying. I hate attention, but there is no way for me to get the help I need without having to take a break from work. I need more than twice monthly therapy at this point. But if this feeling never goes away then why put myself through that humiliation?No matter what I do there is always that emptiness eating away at my progress. The fleeting moments of happiness feel duller each time they come and go. I am not interested in anything anymore. Every single thing in my life is just going through the motions. I am numb to everything. And the it gets better thing sounds more and more like a lie with each passing day.I am just so tired. And I have all but resigned myself to putting my head on my pillow every night and hoping I do not wake up. Does this feeling ever go away?",1

I just feel so terrible all day and I have these nonstop intrusive urges/thoughts of suicide, death, etc. Its almost long random, strong urges to hurt myself. Seems to be getting worse by the day.

"First off yes my username is funny, but let us get down to what I am really here for. My main problem is I cannot stop thinking about hurting people. Not just killing people but torturing and defilement of the living and dead. At this point I genuinely want this, though in my mind I know its wrong the struggle is emotionally I do not care at all. Really not sure what I want out of saying all this, some advice possibly? Empathy? Maybe just comfort in at least a possibility of being able to talk about this sort of thing without being branded as a horrible person which I already believe myself. I am scared of talking to people about my suicidal thoughts, anxiety, ect, but I am definitely scared to talk about this. Also I am already taking meds and going to therapy if anyone was about to recommend either. Lmk if you have any questions. I should probably use a throwaway account or make a longer post but fuck it.",1

Every time I see them I have to act like it did not happen and everythings cool but I have been hyper sexual since. Questioning my sexuality and identity. My parents had an awful marriage and I witnessed it fall apart. Dad is a gambling addict and cheated on my mother. Had twins with this other woman and hid it from me for almost 18 years. Grew up around domestic violence, I was beaten as a child. My own mother punched me in the face once. My sister is schizophrenic because of all the trauma me and her have been through. We both were bullied at school and have had racist remarks and jokes said to us. Even been encouraged to end it. I was falsely accused of sexual harassment for a kiss on the cheek and now I have a reputation as an abuser even though I am not. I have been trying so hard for so long and nothing ever changes. No woman will ever love me for who I am and not what I provide. Nobody cares about my passion/art and its the only thing that brings me joy. Too bad Ill never get anywhere with it and Ill have to work a job I hate for the rest of my life and die. Wrote my suicide note",0
"Married guy, 35, with bipolar 2, ADHD, major depression, major anxiety, I suspect I might also have autism. I also have several chronic medical issues that have me in a level of pain between a 7 and 10 on the daily. And I have started losing control of my ability to function lately. I cannot muster the energy to clean myself much less the house. I hurt all the time physically and mentally. Nothing brings me joy. I am on autopilot. I am constantly forgetting everything. My poor wife is basically my secretary making sure I take my meds, go to my doctor appointments, keep my own side business running, etc. It just feels like the time to end it is drawing ever closer. Closeted new asexual and it has finally started to have an affect on my wife. My depression and anxiety just keeps dragging me further down the pit of despairso even if I wanted I could not perform. My anxiety and anger is getting to be too much. I can hardly concentrate at work and its starting to become a problem as well. I am seeing a therapist and taking meds but nothing seems to be working. And I am just making my wife miserable with my own wretched misery. I do not want to be alive anymore. I have thought about selling my stuff. I have googled the meds I take to see if an OD would kill me. I also own a gun and have access to sharp objects. The one thing keeping me from ending it is what it would do to my wife. Sure she would emotionally be ok after a while but she would lose the house, would end up losing the business she is worked so hard to start. And she knows she is the only thread keeping me hanging on, which just adds to her misery even more. Its almost like a catch 22. I do not know why I am here really. I am too much of a coward to actually do it. But I also do not have anyone I can tell my tale of oh woe is me.. I suppose the lack of energy is a good thing since it keeps me from working up the courage to actually do it. Feels like the time is drawing near",1

Now she regrets not having done anything better like asking if she needed someone. She said she did not want to ask too much because she did not want to hurt her and was scared. Now, recently, she blames herself on a what if scenario, saying that if things had gone bad, she would have been potentially responsible for not saving her friend. Apparently her friend was a great friend and she does not consider herself one. I honestly do not know what I should be telling her as I am the only one she is informed.

"I have been diagnosed with ADHD since early childhood and autism since 21. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Its nearly my 26th and my mind is now ruminating over the notion that life truly is meaningless; that it is inevitable we will inflict suffering on one another; that we will suffer from not just the presence of pain but also the abscence of the certain kinds of happiness we individually want; that we could be born into a life of suffering (a nagging existential thought since my teenage years); that we are at the mercy of our emotions sometimes; that the end of the universe will freeze us to death.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is probably why society shuns suicide and mental illness: they do not want people getting these kinds of ideas and adding them up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let me affirm that there is an opposing statement to my statement: the controversial Omega Point.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Overthinking too much. Its terrifying we cannot control the circumstances of our birth and our emotions, that we are not entitled to anything and entropy will kill us.",1

"I have struggled with my mental health to varying degrees over the last 5-6 years, At some points feeling like things are finally getting better and others times feeling prepared to end it all.In the earlier years, the thought of suicide and death would strike fear in me. Not necessarily the permanent nature of it or the endless return to nothingness. However, more the process of dying, the act itself, the internal fear of building myself up to commit.This distinction must have had a lasting effect, over the last 5 years I have developed a pattern of having dreams where I have died in life-life realism. Moments of fear before the moment of death, the moment itself - followed by seconds of nothingness, all before waking up in a panic.I would say I have experienced 4-5 of these dreams per week for the last 2 years. These night terrors have developed and grown in detail and frequency over the years, however, this growth in frequency has seemed to diminished my personal reaction and how I feel about the act of dying. I caught myself thinking that Death no longer scares me because it feels I have died 1000 times already. Now that I have returned to contemplating suicide in recent months. I reflect on how I am feeling now to when this all started those thoughts a few years ago. As of right now, I have never felt more indifferent to the nature of death and how relaxed I could be If I were to end things in the near future. What might this feel like in months and years to come.This numbingness should scare me more than it does. My dreams have prepared me for death.",1

"36 (m) here. 20 years of major depression, GAD, OCD etc. due to bad childhood and trauma. I grew up raised by an alcoholic single mother who emotionally abused me, even when i was already an adult.Now, I occasionally realise that I am out of juice and still trying my best to please and emotionally support my wife. She has bipolar (and BPD although that is well in control now). I work and study in order to better support us financially, since she cannot work. I do chores and try to energize her to help. Today i sat with her at the kitchen table, eating food i had made just her in mind, and her silence and empty stare into nothingness just broke me. I suddenly thought of how I am fighting a battle I cannot win, and that whatever i do is useless, she is not emotionally present and she will abandon me eventually. All of a sudden I wanted to kill myself although everything is ""fine"". Nothing I do will ever make her take the same initiative that I have or make her go through shitstorms to please me like I have done for her, and I will have to either live with this or abandon her (which is the last thing i want to do because she is very vulnerable).

"Good morning!I have a question regarding medication here in Germany. I am in psychotherapy for over a year now with a wonderful psychologist, the thing is, my psychologist lives in Crete, Greece due to the fact that my partner is Greek and it is nearly impossible here in Germany to get a psychologist if you are ""normal insuranced"". In Germany there are two types of health insurances, based on the field you work in. Privately insuranced people are usually higher income. The majority of people are health insuranced as required by law, which usually covers everything, but to get an appointment for specialized doctors, not only talking about psychiatrists, but also talking about doctors like dermatologists, it is a huge advantage to be privately insuranced , because most doctors either only accept privately insuranced patients, because they bring in more money, or do not accept anymore patients at all. Now to me. I am a 30 year old male who struggles with mental health issues since I was 19. I always coped with them by myself, because I was gay who was not out yet and because of that always single. That changed when I was 24, when I came out and I thought Now my life would change, which it did first. When I met my current partner 5 years ago, I was over the moon. Life was good, I had a good job that made me happy, money was stable, I was in love. After 6 months, my problems started. I always had a social phobia, but not in like being afraid about other people, I have never had problems with others. More like going outside, meaning agoraphobia. I always coped with it by myself and after some time my symptoms (all related to my stomach - nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, or in general the urge to go to the toilet immediately as soon as I have to go somewhere) would get better. But when it got worse when I was together with my partner, it did not get better ever since. I talked to him when it started (April 2017) what my issue was and he was, and still is, very understanding, all in all a great man. But life happens. He also had some problems at work, and I really try to support him, but I am not always able to do that because of my agoraphobia, because to relax he just loves to go outside or travel, which I cannot do. And I am noticing, that this is affecting him as well. After some time, maybe after 2 years, he encouraged me to look for a psychotherapist. I do not know how it works elsewhere, but here in Germany a psychotherapist is not allowed to medicate you if necessary, for that you need a psychiatrist. So I looked for one. I found two here jn Germany, but with both them, I did not really get along with them and I did not feel comfortable with them. And then I found my current psychotherapist, who lives in Greece, we have appointments over the internet once a week and we FaceTime. She is really wonderful and diagnosed me with depressions and suggested to look for a psychiatrist to talk about medications. And that is where the problems start. it is basically impossible for me to find one , because they either only take in privately insuraned patients (which I am not) or do not accept any patients at all. And I notice that my partner is slipping away. He coped with me for 5 years now and was so patient, but I think his patience is getting to an end. Which I understand. He gave up so much for me the last few years (not travelling) , which makes him happy , and also struggles with his own problems, and he cannot really do anything good for him, because he just wants to travel with me, or at least just go out somewhere, which he cannot with me. I try, but as soon as the day comes when we planned something, I feel sick, basically run in the bathroom every five minutes. And it shows. I really try to not let him see that, because I want to make him happy, but of course he notices and at the end we end up not going somewhere or we do not go out at all. I manage now to go out a little bit ( there is a Caf right next to our place and there is a park nearby where we hang out) but we only do these two things, and it is boring him, which I understand. Because he just wants to do stuff. And it hurts me to see that he is in pain because of me, because I also affects him mentally. He also goes out with his friends, but he just really want to do other stuff with me too, for which I love him , because he just wants me to feel better. And it would devastate me to see him suffer more. Or worse, if he would leave me... which I would I kind of understand though.So, dear readers, has anybody any suggestions? Or people from Germany, do you have any idea how to get an appointment at a psychiatrist, in hope that a medication would help me? Thank you! In search of a psychiatrist in Germany",0

"Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY. I just never feel enough, be it in my family, my friendships, or my relationship. Whatever I do, I can never be good enough. At this point, I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy, all I remember is feeling sad, that is IT, THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings, I hate getting attached, I hate trusting someone, I have my mother, I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate, but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me. I lost myself and I cannot seem to find her again. It just does not get fucking easy, it is just torture. why am I never good enough?",0

I am just trying to understand. Recently I have been starting to wonder if I have been depressed for years and just not realized it. I do know I have other disorders for sure though. -I read an article a while back and I started thinking about it. I used to have a certain conception of what depression was/is. Then I started thinking, well crap, have I been depressed all this time? Some context:-Getting out of bed is kind of hard. I usually lay in bed for an hour after I wake up with semi-dread or annoyance at the idea of having to do things. I do not sleep well. I have been feeling tired midday more recently for some reason. -I have a hard time with basic self maintenance.

"Like really, are you going to tell someone who is depressed to ""stop with the siege mentality and move on with life""? Sure, you may be depressed also with the current sh\*t show of how the upper echelons are handling this pandemic and the never-ending lockdown that takes a toll on people's mental health, but telling others with your hard love will not help anybody.Plus, stop telling me to seek professional help. Your intention may be helpful, but I am done with the ""so-called"" mental health professionals or therapists who were being unempathetic. I hate spending my hard-earned cash on seeking professional help, only to get my mental health worse (been caught by this once), and being in a country where religion is omnipresent, are you going to see a professional advising you on religious stuff instead of supposedly helping you personally? I have been super duper wary with seeing another professional after my first experience seeing an unempathetic one ever since.Also, if you are in the good, you do not need to brag that what you did was working for you. Sure, yeah, good for you that it works, but stop expecting others to be on the same page as you too, no matter how good the intention is. Again, be empathetic. If that person does not want to do what you did, just do not force him or her further with your intentions, can you?By the very least, can people be more empathetic? everyone is dealing hard with the current situation right now, but if you are in the good (or even not so good), you do not need to be an a\*\*. Being empathetic really means a lot for many, including myself. Even a simple video call that cheers up each other would mean a lot, I have to admit.I am sorry if my words are all over the place. My mental health is not in a good mode, but if anyone's struggling, let us support each other... The lack of empathy by many people in my country is just astonishing",0

"I identify myself as introvert. Since I have been exposed to internet from year 2016 I have always found comfort in reading about Psychology. I am fascinated by MBTI, Big 5 Models, Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine.

"I am at my wits end. I grew up in a broken home, parents who physically fought and abused drugs and alcohol. I was abandoned by my parents as a teenager and had to look after myself and meet my physical needs from the age of 13 - I had no one to give me love and emotional support - for that I turned to unhealthy habits. I grew up hanging out with a bad crowd and we were taken advantage of by an adult we should have trusted. I have made terrible decisions about people I let into my life because I was not shown what a healthy relationship was, I have witnessed my best friend drown, I have lost countless friends and family members before I even turned 20. Yet, somehow I climbed out of these dark holes, I am nearly thirty and still learning how to take care of myself - adult things that no one showed me. I studied at someone of the top universities in my field, have experience career-wise so am able to get a job to feed myself and put a roof over my head. I have travelled extensively and currently live abroad - my friends often express their envy of my life. But the thing is I am miserable, I am tired of it all I want the memories to leave I want the pain to stop. I have been to therapy but the memories do not go they are still there and I do not want them anymore. I figure I have two options to end it all and forget - or pack my backs live a life free from any worry - these options feel like two sides of the same coin for me. Because if I end it all I might as well ignore the all-consuming anxiety that takes over my life. I am so over it. I just wish I had a better start in life instead of continually being dragged down by my blacken-heart. Life has been hard and I want to forget it",1

"For starters I have Borderline Personality Disorder, a condition that makes me emotionally unstable and amplifies negative emotions tenfold; it is the hardest personality disorder to live with, and the least likely to be taken seriously by others. Look it up, it is actually quite sad. Add to that a debilitating addiction to Crystal meth, a drug that is statistically harder to quit than heroin. Meth, like Borderline Personality, carries a heavy stigma, one that opioid addicts and even crackheads are not given as much. The withdrawal comes with crippling physical fatigue and weakness making everything exhausting. But worst of all is a feeling of intolerable depression that comes from nowhere, a depression like nothing you have ever felt before. I dread the amplification of that depression from my BPD and thus I stay high for weeks until I am broke. When I first wake up detoxing, I feel the depression spread through me and my thoughts are consumed with darkness. To top it off, I am about to be homeless again in a matter of weeks, and I am terrified, absolutely terrified of living outdoors in this constant extreme humidity in the middle of summer. So to recap, I have withdrawals that because intolerable depression, a personality disorder that amplifies negative emotions, and I am going to be homeless in nonstop summer heat. BPD is the.worsr personality disorder and carries the worst stigma of its kind.Meth is the worst drug, and carries the worst stigma of its kindHomeless people are so stigmatized they are treated like scum, like second class citizens. So in conclusion, I am about to experience the worst depression possible and be treated with nothing but cruelty and apathy. Oh and I am very likely to die a slow death from heat stroke as people step over me and let it happen because they hate me.I have enough fentanyl in my possession to kill 10 people, a needle, and a fate so grim I cannot even.wrap my head around it. All I think about is suicide. No one would care, even though my situation is objectively worse than everyone else's, and I know I deserve the utmost sympathy, I am the least likely to receive it.So why should not I kill myself?

So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21-year-old black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know.

I find myself extremely less productive these days. I cannot meet deadline on my projects. Not because I do not have enough time if I put my mind to it. Just because I have zero motivation to do it. I have heard in the past from people that this could be a sign of depression. But I do not feel sad. I just do not know what I feel. How do I know if I should seek medical help? How do I know if I am depressed?,0

I want it all to stop hurting.I know I could have it worse. And I am not looking for attention or for someone to come be my savior. I just need to get it out there. To know someone knows that I am not okay. That I am tired. Things are not *that* bad in my life which is why I do not feel comfortable complaining. But I am tired of being quiet and lying about how I am doing. I just want it all to stop. I had my first therapy appointment and I lied about a lot. I told her I do not want to off myself but I think about it. Truth is, I do. I would give anything to have a guilt free death. One where no one would blame themselves or others. It just happened.

I finally was going to take the steps in an attempt to improve my mental health by admitting myself to an intensive outpatient program for a few weeks. It would have been 5 days per week from 9-3pm.

"I am 16. Unlike a lot of schools mine has groups for just about everyone because it is huge (3000 students). So you have to be especially weird and a true loser to not have friends. Of course there is people i bullshit with in class but I have not spoken to anyone except my parents in the last 2 months, I am afraid to go anywhere with my parents for fear of being seen by someone i know from school and being laughed at. It really hits hardest when I am holed up inside watching SCP videos in my room on a beautiful day. Instead of going out with my friends like literally everyone else, I am watching YouTube and working on a summer assignment for AP classes that I would not take if my parents did not demand I work hard in school. They have some delusion that I will be a genius who makes them money. Lol. Honestly SCP is the best fandom for the depressed, it let us me forget how boring the world is AND it let us me fantasize about something I would enjoy. The brutal reality is the SCP universe is one of very few fictional universes where people like me matter. In real life being a weird science lover who enjoys thinking about stuff without a deadline ruins your life. Irl Dr. Bright would live in his mom's basement. Man, it stings to turn off the YouTube video or close the article tab and remember real life. that is the other thing. I REALLY want to work as hard as I can to avoid being a parasite. I will work as hard as I need to to play video games and watch SCP videos in MY OWN BASEMENT. I am not going to let life disappear while ruining my parents financial state. I am planning to study abroad and emigrate to a country (most likely Belgium) better suited for 20 year olds to live alone than America. I also hate when people act like I do not enjoy learning. I do. I just hate having to take tests when I will never produce anything of value for all my work. I like to just think about stuff and read interesting things, i just hate people forcing me to do it. Sorry I am rambling again. Anyway I have already got an internship as a journalist, so I am trying to get the ball rolling on not living in my parents basement. Well, time to go bury my head in fiction to forget my shitty life. The best part about SCP? Very few relationships. they are a whole organization full of people like me!

"I just completely broke down screaming, crying, shouting negative banter. I really think this session could have gone well if I controlled myself and analyzed my thoughts. it is been so tough these past days and I just could not take it anymore. My therapist was left speechless and could not put a word in. it is ok to have a shoulder to cry on but it is depressing knowing there is only so much they can do but listen. I just want things to be better but so much is going wrong. I am so lost. I am so confused. I am starting to have homicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. I am so angry.

"I am a failure. I failed my mom, I failed my dad, I failed the girl I liked and most importantly I failed myself. I use to be in this sub to understand others, maybe I will build some empathy and love myself more or at least forgive myself for my mistakes. I have always tried to do good, I swear. But life keeps fucking me in the ass with no lube. I try to act normal, go out with friends, work harder, learn new things but I feel everything is just an act. I still feel empty, with no clear path to follow. I am just a tragedy. I never noticed it but all the signals were always there. there is no time during the day or night I feel painless. I am really trying but fuck man it is as if God or idk who the fuck is in charge (assuming there is someone) is just making fun of me, making my struggles bigger day by day. I am young, in less than a year I would have graduated from a top tier uni and hopefully things will improve. But is not the prospect of a better life that keeps me from harming myself. But that of my family, friends and her. Most of them do not even know what is going on. The ones who know kind of understand and tell me that it will make me stronger. Thing is, I am so tired of being strong. I am just weak and pathetic. The idea of doing it keeps popping in my head, but I will keep fighting. If I decide that is is not worth the fight anymore, that I want to be a coward and do not care about my love ones. Here is the proof that I do. I care more about them than I care about me. I will give my life for all of them. There is NO escape",1

They were not someone Id typically go for but it just felt like we fit together. They made every day better. They were my rock. And then I found out the whole time he was just using me, he would been seeing other people. And now I cannot breathe and my whole world is just so much worse.

"She actually told me to ""get over it and grow up"". Usually we are fine. But she always pushes me too much and I still keep shut. She keeps demanding to know why I am ""useless"". So today I told her. Growing up (13-22) while trying to stop her from killing herself over and over again, mentally fucked me up. Being physically abused when she was lost due to alcohol and pain killer abuse, made me lose hope.Then having her have good phases where everything was good.. confused me.I am traumatized. Therapy helped up to a point. She finally got help and now does not remember what she put me through. I never put anything on her cuz I was just happy she got better.But now she blames me for everything. Goes on and on about how she sacrificed so much for me and how I should feel guilty for not working. And I tried. I tried SO FUCKING HARD to get a job. My anxiety is through the roof. I do not even want to live. I do not even live with them anymore. And yet she pushes. Because I am not as ""good"" as our relatives kids. I am useless.Now I feel scared and guilty cuz I might have triggered her. I am anticipating my dad's call and he will just reiterate how horrible I am. I have heard it so much in the past. Yes they have helped me a lot financially but mentally they broke me. I AM trying to repay them. I really am. Every call with them is pushing me to towards the edge. Every call makes me hurt myself (I have been SH-ing since I was 13). I cannot cut them out of my life. it is too hard to explain.I cannot stop feeling guilty.. I know I hurt her a lot today by being honest.. but in a way I also feel better cuz I was holding this in for over a decade and a half. My dad is her enabler. And I have no one. I do not know what to do. The anxiety of them calling me again or me talking to them next time is freaking me out.How do I deal with this? She says she has a lifetime of trauma which is worse than mine and she got over it so I should too. I do not know how to respond to that when she is the source of my trauma. She refused to accept professional help when I was a kid and if she did I might not have gone through what I did. Is it fair for her to say that to me?? I know I am being immature or whatever.. but I do not know how to let go of this when this is all I have known and all my efforts to make my life better keep failing.

whenever you try to find safe ways to die painless by choice all you find is prevention. which forces people into botched horror suicides. who are others to judge whether someone should end their life. you cannot know someone elses pain or the hopelessness of their situation. people act as if its so important to stay alive then treat you like shit and leave you to yourself the rest of it why can people not just go,1
"Cat walked across the road? Must be the universe trying to save you. Dropped your keys? Must be a sign it is time to end things. it is a constant rollercoaster for me, and I really wish the end of the ride is somewhere high, but that is not usually how rollercoasters go. Being suicidal divides everything in your life into two groups things are either trying to kill you or trying to save you",1

"Hello Reddit! I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language. Any sort of advice, words of kindness would truly help. Thank you.I have made a post on this account before, and writing my feelings out made my pain feel a little more bearable, so I hope this does the same. I was born in a typical central European family with a loving mother, a slight narcassistic father who I dearly love and my two older sisters. My whole life always felt a little bit misplaced. My school grades were always very good, and I was reading quite advanced books from an early age, which had some consequences like; growing up too early and costant boredom at school because I did not get enough of a challange. My social life had been very poor, and I was getting constantly picked on which resulted in a low self-esteem and depression. I was eleven when I first tried to kill myself. I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for about six months, and finally got off anti-depressants last August. (Two years later).This year has been very tough. After I switched schools I have met a boy who I had feelings for and for the first time in forever, I felt truly happy. After being friends for eight months, he lead me in the woods and took advantage of me. Things have not been the same. It took me three months to hug my mom after that. I never told my family, but I did tell my closest friends. It hurted seeing him laugh with his friends, living his best life while I was sitting at the back of the class holding in another panic attack. But I can always remember who was always willing to take a walk and let me rant about my feelings, spend some silly young times together and take on the world like it was ours. It was my best friend, neighbour and someone you could call a blood-unrelated older sister. She took her life a month ago, on the hill we used to make memories on.I wonder where she is now. Dealing with her death has been a very tough experience I cannot describe. Some feelings words just cannot get a grip of. I am celebrating my fifteenth birthday in five days, and I still cannot believe I made it this far. Maybe I do not have a will to live right now, but maybe my point of living is to find it.The stars shine a little brighter now that you have joined them, Ana. My best friend took her own life",0

"Like the title says I have been thinking about killing myself all day today. Now suicidal thoughts are nothing new to me, but usually they are fleeting and sort of go away on their own, but not today. I am serious about it today, I typed up and suicide note while I was at work and put some thought into a method today (shotgun in the mouth). I feel guilty that I feel this way because I actually have a pretty ok life, I have wonderful family and friends who are nothing but supportive of my struggles, I have a decent job, and with the exception of my severe bipolar disorder I am in good health. But I am also dealing with addiction and trying (and failing so far) to get sober is putting me in a state of mind that thinks suicide is a viable option. I am in pain, and the only thing I want is to be free of this pain and I just do not know how to go about accomplishing that. The intellectual part of my mind tells me that these feelings will pass and I will feel better, but the emotional part of me is telling me there is no hope and I should just end it all. Pretty much the only reason I have not already done it is because I love my family and friends too much. My best friend in college killed himself, so I know firsthand what its like the be the one who is left behind, and I would not wish that feeling on anyone. But that leaves me just living a life I do not want to live for the sake of other people, I feel trapped. I do not know I suppose I am rambling now, I just thought if I got this off of my chest I would feel better, I guess well see. Been thinking about ending it all day today.",1

"I have written here before but I felt ashamed and deleted the post. I was diagnosed with g.a.d, social anxiety, and major depressive disorder 2 years ago. I have been suicidal since the tenth grade but I was able to brush the thought away for a while. I thought this feeling would go away once I head to college but I realized I never wanted to go in the first place. I also realized that school overall severely triggered me. I cannot study, I am always tired, insomniac, and therapy is going nowhere. I have given up on myself. I thought maybe I could drop college and start working jobs but my parents told me I could not because it ruins my 'social standing' in life, and I would be nothing without it. I love my family but even they are a lot sometimes and judgy. nothing in my life is going right, and since college started I have just gotten more suicidal and tried to kill myself three times but all three times I stopped myself cuz I was scared. I feel like I am losing my mind. I do not know what to do anymore. I want to die but I cannot. there are just too many people i could hurt and they do not deserve that. i feel like i should not feel this way because people have it worst, but i just have not been happy in so long. man, life sucks. my life is falling apart and i hate living",1

"Help only works for those who help themselves. I think I am just not cut out for the life. I think I had enough. I am just inherently incapable of doing anything in life. I want to sleep forever. Sleep is the only thing that does not hurt. Except that every second of being hurts. I always try to fight it back and remain optimistic. But I think this is the time. This is the feeling. it is a signal from Universe to me, this feeling. That I am a mistake and I deserve nothing. Because I just cannot put efforts in anything now. I feel ashamed that I do not even have courage to end my life. Maybe this is my fate to just suffer. Suffer endlessly without any ability to stop this suffering.

"I am going to start out by saying I am depressed and anxious but my depression feels like nothing when compared to those around me. Both of my parents are currently going through cancer scares. My dad has had cancer removed from his lungs many times and is extremely depressed, lays in bed all day every day except when there is a family function, which he goes to but barely participates in conversation. Unfortunately, my brother is the worst of all. He lives on his own about 45 minutes away and I guess my family was not paying close enough attention this past 6 months. He would come to family gatherings and act happy and we would always ask how things were at his house and we were always told fine, the last we saw him was Christmas. In February, he cut my entire family off, will not speak to any of us and says we never once cared about him. Many of my family members go to his house and try to get him to talk to us but he will not come to the door and we are told to go away. We called the police, we were told he is not a threat and they could not do anything. We called the mental health hotline and they sent someone who said he came to the door, they said your family is concerned about you and he said no they are not. They mentioned he does not look healthy and very pale. Our mom tried to go into the house as she has a key and he shoved her out. Lastly, we told a neighbor that used to work with him about the issue and he went into the house from the back. He told us my brother admitted he has not been to work in 2 months and there is dog feces and beer cans everywhere in the house. This situation is causing my depression and anxiety to spiral, it is all I think about but I am trying to be strong for my parents, my mom is having major surgery this week.I do not know where to turn to. I am sorry if this is all over the place, I am lost. My entire family is depressed",0
"I am 19 and I feel like I have wasted the best years of my life. When I was younger I was extremely shy and scared of everything. I was scared of talking to people at my school, and talking to girls. Even though I was not ugly or something. When I went to highschool I did not really enjoy going to partys with people I did not know so I partied with my closest friends. Now when I have finished highschool I know that I wasted that time. I wish I was more outgoing, not so shy and did not spend so much time at home. I know that there is a lot of younger people here. So I want you to stop worrying and enjoy this time. Ask her/him out, you have got nothing to lose. you will get rejected? So what? Stop dreaming about things that can happen and actually do something to make them happen. I wish I asked Eve out, I did not do it but I knew that she was into me. Maybe I was wrong? I would get rejected? I do not care. Start living and maybe one day you will not feel like me.

"I literally have NO CLUE why the hell I am writing here... this is pissing me off... I guess I have some questions but there is part of me scared that rather than me getting demotivated and turned away from my thoughts, I might actually give others bad ideas. Whatever...it is just beyond frustration to google the ""so many versions"" of the same question, which might be obvious since I am writing in this sub, and then get the same fucking results every single time just from different websites with the same retarded ""self-help"" ideas (that do not work btw!).But I digress... So here is the meat of the issue: there is absolutely no point to life and/or living. Living makes zero sense and the only logical thing to do is death. And the more I try to distance myself from this shit the more it pursues me. I cannot see the point of life and living, which is not even the biggest issue in and of itself, but I can see a truckload of reasons to die. Guess that is where I am at: no reasons to live, but too many to count to end it.Wherever I google reasons to keep going, all that comes up is stuff like ""tomorrow is another day"", ""it is going to get better if you give it some time"" and ""just get through today"". HEY ASSHOLE! How about after 3.000 (literally) *another day* that sentence seems more like a threat than a message of hope? How about it not getting better? How about getting through today is THE VERY REASON for this? there is only so many *todays* you can get through.Some are even worse, like ""try new things"", ""change how you do things"" and ""Jesus loves you"". The first two basically do not even consider that it might go both ways, whereas the last... Not even going to address it. Honestly, I guess if I could believe (however I cannot, and also am conflicted about it) then it would trick me into the whole ""divine plan"" kind of thing which, as stupid as it is, at least would make it all make sense.Also why bother going to a shrink? To what? Get myself pumped up on drugs that will numb me and, supposedly, get me through another 30 years of this shit? it is not like it would solve the core issue. It would not provide for immortality, hence still ending up in the same place through different means, nor would it give life purpose. So to speak, ignoring truth does not make it less true.I do realize most of the mainstream stuff has the purpose of getting the people who are going through a specific moment and after that they can go back to normal. But what about... people like... me? Those for whom ""this"" is normal. It is abhorrent to think that once all the layers of BS are stripped, all that is left is a world of pain, nothingness, suffering and decay. And if you think I am selfish well FUCK YOU! Had I been selfish probably my life would not have been the total shitshow that it was/is, and I would not be here (mentally, not on reddit).Is it really eating, sleeping, sex, work, drugs and defecating all there really is to life? And do not give me the whole ""human emotions"" crap, we all know those are just chemicals released by our bodies (and easily created in a lab) to make us perceive something that logically is not there. it is so bad to be in the tunnel and realize the light is a lie (pardon the lame videogame homage).I feel pretty pathetic for writing this, but at this point might aswell post it and see if someone has an answer to offer. no idea why I am doing this but looking for an answer",1
"I turn 26 today. And I have just had enough. I have a bottle of 1000 ibuprofen tablets that I am anxious to take but I am scared it will not kill me. How sick is that, that I am more afraid of living through it than dying. I have been scouring the internet for days looking for success stories and there are not as many as I would like there to be. I never thought this would be me. I hate who I have become. Todays my birthday and I want to die",1
"I guess I should preface this by saying that talking does not work. I am too damned stubborn in my baseless negative thoughts, and I do not want to burden my mom by telling her about anything so she can get me to a therapist. With that out of the way, I guess Ill just list all my mistakes that have led me here.1.) I do well in school but not well enough to go to a good college. No good college, no good job, shame for the rest of my life while my older sister flourishes.2.) I fear I am going to end up like my deadbeat dad. Id rather die than leech off of others like he does.3.) I am just not a good person. I am a downer, I do not have anything useful to offer anyone, and I am entirely replaceable.4.) my grandma just died 2 days ago, and my grandpa probably is not too far behind. that is probably the only thing that is slightly out of my control, though I did not spend as much time as I should have with them.But I suppose I cannot complain. Many more people have suffered much worse and still loved life. I am just a useless coward. I am giving up. A hydrocodone overdose is looking really tempting right now. Ill just tell my stupid little story and try to properly plan my death on my own time.",1
I just feel like hanging myself. Some psychopath has my goddamn music.

"I have depression and anxiety due to series of traumatic events. Sometimes, I am just too exhausted even though I am not doing ""anything"". Just plain on survival mode through the years. I do not want this as an excuse but it is my reality. Struggling to do something. Anxious that I end up doing nothing. That by not performing, I am bad. I am made to feel guilty from grieving. I also had a dysfunctional childhood. I have just lately discovering that it was not a good childhood as I have thought it was. Thr way I was brought up and my childhood experiences paved way to why I am like this in adulthood. I am grieving. My parents does not grasp that their adult child is mentally unwell. Of course, it is my fault. I get all the blame. It hurts when your own mother would label you some deregatory term in our language -- ""dugyot"" means a lazy dirty person. It hurts that they do not understand my struggles. I am trying. I grieve that I will never have the parents that I ""needed"". I was crying silently last night. I was a victim of domestic abuse and they offered me to come move back. I know I need therapy but I do not have the means to pay yet. I am just hoping one day to get myself on my own feet and get my own place again. Away from the judgement, shame and guilt that are in this household. Mother called me names. It hurts",0

I have done everything they say you should do.I have a good job. I have a family. I have some friends. I eat healthy. I go to the fucking piece of shit gym everyday and I lift. I run until I cannot. I take stupid meds my psychiatrist gave me. I go to therapy(which is useless). In the end nothing has really changed. I am still alone. I feel a void in my life. I have no purpose and I do not know why I am here. I still want to die. Why are not we allowed to kill ourselves? Why do we have to feel guilty for wanting to die? Fuck this life. I just want to blow my brains out. I work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I take my fucking meds. I still want to kill myself.,1
"I am sure other people have this experience too but I will toss it out there. Who else is genuinely surprised they are not dead yet? I have been sick as a dog with no hope of ever getting better since I was 23 (I am 30 now). I spend pretty much all day every day fantasizing about ending it. I have not mainly because I am not a fan of any of the methods I have available to me, feel like it would disrupt the life of my family, and honestly I am not sure I have the emotional energy to build up to it anymore. But I am still kind of low-level shocked it has not happened yet. Odd place to find oneself. kind of surprised I am not dead yet",1
"I had a pretty bad mental breakdown last week, and my psych (whom I really trust) added two things to my treatment.I am on Bupropion 300mg which I love.She also gave me Eszoplicone for sleeping (worked but it made me very tired). I used to take zolpidem but my anxiety was so bad it would not work. This worked but I still slept terribly, waking up every two hours, vivid dreams, drowsy brain, etc.She also gave me an anti psychotic (Abilify). My experience in the past with them has been quite bad. I took quetiapine and one week later I told her I never wanted it again. I have experience **the** worst feelings when I took anti psychotics.I also read they are not so common to treat depression and anxiety and seem to be given more to people with well... psychosis? But I am not the expert so I do want to give it a try. I feel my anxiety is still pretty bad during the day, so if this would help it would be great. I am not asking for medical advice obviously, but just some general thoughts or your experiences to calm me down before I take it.Also, I never asked my psych if I should take them before or after the antidepressants. I plan on texting her when it is a bit later.The magic of mental illnesses ~ A bit scared to start taking anti-psychotics. Anyone with experiences?",0

"When I was around 10-13 years old, I was very social and made people like me. However, since I left my country at 13 y o I became an outcast. Since the first day of school, I was bullied and made fun of without the ability to defend myself because I did not speak the language of the country I went to. I was so excluded that I had to aimlessly walk in circles in the middle school's playing ground because nobody wanted to talk to me. I felt so awkward. I even followed the other kids in hopes of them including me but I was completely ignored. I was like a ghost to them. Everybody seemed to have fun. It destroyed me to point of shattering my true self-esteem. I endured two years at that middle school then we moved out to another city. At that point, I craved human interaction, was at my ugliest, and started self-harming. Out of nowhere, a girl in my class sees my fresh self-harming scars and tells me that she did the same thing, trying to dissuade me from continuing that practice. We even started chatting on social media trying to ease each other's pain. that is until I told her that I wanted to end it all and that I loved her. She threatened to call the police, which changed my mind. But that destroyed the bond that we developed and, like a dick, I started trying to guilt her into loving me. Things went south and long story short I became known as the depressed, self-harming, crying-in-school kid (teachers knew about the hit that I did). A status that I would not wish on my worst enemies. Fast forward to my first year of high school. I am still a shadow of my former self trying but I thought that I was reformed. Especially after befriending some friends. I acquired a gym membership and even willingly did a speech to my class, at the end of the year talking about how people change, how our class was perfect class accepting of everyone, and being a microcosm that could meticulously project our society. A microcosm where we can find the future: artists, doctors, architects, engineers, and more. Ending the speech with the confession of my love to a girl. Everything seemed going right. ""I am improving,"" I said to myself. Then year 2 comes. The whole year, my ""friends"" and I only talked in school. Rarely texting and we do it is for me being used as a tool for something. I spent all the holidays alone on my pc trying to lie on myself saying things like ""I do not need friends anyway"", ""I am happy"". Sometimes, I unveil my true feelings and start crying by the least trigger such as reading about how much people are having fun in their lives. I hate it when I see people happy. I hate god. I hate my life. I hate the wealthy who can do whatever the fuck they want (and do not fkn tell me how money does not buy happiness because a depressed wealthy person is \*100 better than a poor depressed person) And I certainly would have driven a fkn spear to my heart if it was not for the fact that I am a coward and that my parents have already paid for my college preparation year. GOD BE DAMNED FOR HAVING MADE ME INTO THIS FUCKING UGLY CREATURE WITH NOTHING SPECIAL, JUST TO TORMENT ME. I hate this world",0

"Because all my friends are either busy or also depressed and even suicidal like me. Because no one understands and that makes me resent them more.Because they do not know how to help, which only makes me feel worse.Because they turn it around and make it about themselves.This is too much for anyone untrained to deal with, not even therapists do much to help, and I really hate feeling like a burden and frustrating people. I hate feeling selfish. I am still just waiting to die. My physical health keeps worsening, so perhaps I can bet on that. Why do not you reach out to someone?",0
"A year and a half of Isolation. I already lived alone. Over the months I started becoming an alcoholic again. My last straw was yet another asshole misdagnosing me at the VA.

I am not even going to get into that day and what it felt like but I am different and broken now. But no - one dr says ptsd is inconvenient for him. Of fuckinv course I have ptsd from that. To suggest otherwise is cruel. Tonight i got drunk because I was sad I could not camp with my friends due to my insect sting allergy. I cannot even be outside like a normal person because 1 fire ant sting could kill me. you cannot do anything apparently. And then I was drunk bitching about something which my best friend took personal. Maybe I was mad about something bit I cannot remember. I was so drunk I cannot say she is wrong. All I know is it is another serious relationship gone. My last straw was my beloved brother parting ways unexpectedly months back because ""I am just like"" everyone else in the family he resents.

"I have been through some terrible things. I have put other people through terrible things. I cannot escape my childhood and my emotional stunting that followed.

I have some people that care about me. it is not that I do not believe life has been good to me. Sure, it is been rough but it is been so bad for others and I have had a lot of privilege in my life. it is not really a cry for help, I do not think...I think I want someone to agree with me and tell me I am making sense but I do not know what I would say if someone asked me how they could help ...

I cannot even try fix myself because my country is banning conversion therapy (not that I would have high hopes for it working anyway). No one I know even gets it, they all believe that there is nothing wrong with being gay. Maybe they are right, but that does not mean I want to be like this. I cannot be this kind of person and be happy. I will never be able to feel self-respect again. I should have just killed myself 15 years ago when I first started having homosexual urges. I had sex with another man, and now I have to kill myself",1
"Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself. What is wrong with me",0

What if I am not meant for any of this? I do well in one part of my life and another part fails. I cannot do it all. I do not know why. What if I just suck?,0
"I just sit here everyday. Doing nothing. Accomplishing nothing. By the time its 1 AM or 4 AM, I am in bed crying wondering why I am still alive and scrolling to find some aid on assisted suicide. I have tried suicide hotlines, but they never seem to be able to help me. I have had someone hang up on me before. It was after my father snapped at me and called me ugly that I started questioning whether or not I deserved to live. Everyday he would degrade how I look. I was already aware of it. My teeth are rotten, I have a gap in the middle of my teeth, I am obese, have skin illnesses causing it to look disgusting and wrinkly, and my skin tone is dark meaning I am already ugly to many. Being ugly is just a death sentence/I wish my facade of ""I do not care what people think about me"" was true, but it was not.I have been having other health issues, but I cannot afford to go to a doctor or get therapy. I have anxiety every single day. I cannot ever sleep because recurring nightmares. When I need to take medication, I cannot even take a single pill because my gag reflexes and anxiety. Pretty sure I also have undiagnosed ADHD. I want to go to the doctor, but I fear just being forced to take pills or medicine.My parents get mad at me for not being able to do anything because of my crippling depression, but my agoraphobia is extreme. I never want to go outside. I never want anybody to see me. I feel ashamed at my parents just looking at me. I hate my body and everything about it. I barely take care of my body anymore because of the hate I have for it.If I could say one accomplishment, it would be that I finished college with bachelors of fine arts, but I am getting nowhere in my life. I used to be able to do so many illustrations for clients, but I have not been able to focus or motivate myself and it is causing me extreme distress. I am in so much debt on work I owe for my clients, but I just cannot complete them no matter how hard I try. I tried recently applying for my dream job and I also managed to get it, but I was laid off in a few days because my boss wanted to go travel the world instead of work. I am still stuck in crippling student debt from this with no way of paying it backAll of this just tells me that I am a failure as a human being. My parents constantly tell me that. My sister does not even talk to me anymore and we used to be so close. I used to have friends irl but they just stopped talking to me after college. I tried to ask someone for help saying I am suicidal and lost and all they said was ""mmm okay?"" I lost hope in them. It just feels like nobody cares about me and I do not want to be a waste of space anymore. My body is dying and I see no hope of me improving anytime soon. I still have dreams and wishes, but life does not want me here. I do not know what to do. I want my work ethics back. I want to be healthy. I want to feel like I belong, but it is so hard. I have wishes and dreams, but life does not want me here.",1
I have nothing left and my life looks so much worse than I could have ever thought possible I just think I am going to end it I want to die any day now have nothing left to live for,1
The last 2 weeks have been so hard. I do not think I can continue. My stomach looks like a chess board covered in blood. I do it on my chest because its harder to find. I have 1 reason so live and that is it. And so many more not to. I cannot go on anymore,1
Someone who does NOT have to live with my body and my memories is not entitled to tell me that I am worth something. There is nothing good or sweet-tempered about cheering me on to live this life. I do not want to hear how strong I am. I only endure this because I love my friends and family (who hates me) and our society does not tolerate suicide. Why I hate hearing anti-suicide stuff,0
"I have been postinf here lately. Idk, I think I am just trying to release some pressure. I think I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted. I grew up with zero friends, no friends at all. I felt sad about it for several years... but I feel like this no more. Getting hookups on tinder, making temporary friends, casual chat with other Xbox players and never talking with them again. I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes, it is good to exchange some messages and stuff, but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say, what I do. Not trying to be edgy, trust me. But I think I got to a point where I am dead inside and I do not care if people see it anymore. I have two friends (I met both of them here. Good people, I hope we can still talk, love ya), but I simply do not care about others. I feel no empathy, no remorse, nothing. I know, I should seek help and blah, blah, blah. But the world is just... I fought for my life many years. Tried to seek help, went to therapy, that kind of stuff. But I just cannot see any hope. I go outside and I feel sick. People is just so selfish, ignorant and not a single one of them gives a fuck about others.I worked as a paramedic for a couple of years, donated to charities, tried to be a good person. But the world took me down. I do not know, I think this might be it. This is my life from now on. Not feeling anything. Enjoying my loneliness and feeling empty at the same time. This is it. This is it... I do not know if I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted or just getting used to it. Becoming a cynical person pt.1",0
"People are so mean. they are awful. They hurt, lie, kill, steal, manipulate, whatever you can think of. The world is so messed up. I do not want to be apart of it anymore. The bad outweighs the good at this point. I do not want to try and find the good anymore, because everywhere I look there is murder, suicide, rape, fighting, stealing, etc. and I do not want to deal with it anymore. The world is so cruel. I do not want to fight for life. I am not strong enough to. there is so much wrong in the world and there is nothing I can do to fix it. I wish I was never brought into this terrible place. I want to leave. I do not want to be around anymore.",0
"I am a 17 year old trans guy and I have got two older sisters and a younger brother. Me and my brother currently live with my mother and she and my father are divorcing due to them both cheating on eachother her first them him. My mother acts like the victim all the time so its always he hurt her and hes fine its all her she is depressed also my grandfather passed away he was my idol it destroyed me when we lost him but all she was interested in was the money and the house yet she constantly uses it as something to make me and my younger brother breakdown and cry for because she is seeking pitty for what she is doing to us when my father left my mother started talking and bringing a large amount of men around sometimes saying we should call them daddy some were dealers some were addicts some were both and whenever we expressed that we were uncomfortable with the situation at hand she became very agitated and would blame us for her so called depression and say things to the effect of regretting our existence she nolonger hits us but she always threatens to over small things like not cleaning the house we live in completly and when we do she then seeks out a different reason or creates a reason to then yell at us she sometimes goes and acts like she is going to get a gun saying we are the reason she is going to kill herself but never does anything with it they belonged to my grandfather she tells my 11 year old brother that hes so disrespectful to the women who almost died giving birth to him and always throws that in his face as if he chose to be birthed out of her she says she cannot tell me anything in fear that ill end my own life yet she tells me everything at one point she had become agitated because for a few days she had been leading me and my brother to our darker days and we would have killed ourselves if we did not care for eachothers lives my brother sadly walked in on me with a blade and i walked in on him with one aswell so e bad been keeping our distance from her and when our father came over to see us ehich he never does anymore my mother threatened him and then when e got inside she took my phone and my brothers phone so we could not get help as soon as she was done yelling at me i went into my bedroom full mental breakdown ended up cutting not deep enough because she threw my phone at me and left but it was already to late and my brother came into my room begging me to not leave him and my mother came into my room screaming at us again i literally was in the process of ending my life then she wanted me to open up to her and talk to her get i could barely breathe because i was crying and everyone who knows ne knows i have a thing with people touching me it takes me to a really dark place especially when I am sad and my mother restrained me and layed on me and i still could not breathe in that time i screamed like a baby for a while after her new man pulled her off of me and left i was stuck screaming and acting like a baby i could not act other way it was like i was looking through a glass at what i was doing i had calmed down thanks to my brother and when i seen the marks she left on my wrists i scratched myself until i could not see them anymore and then went numb both emotionally and physically also so my mother will not let me work because as long as she is buying everything i must do whatever she says or my basic needs are taken away she gets angry when i defend my father saying he was never there for me which he was not i raised myself all they ever did was feed me and keep a roof over my head but my father never treated me to bad like my mother my entire life i was ignored I have been suicidal as long as i can remember and trust me i have credible reasons for being suicidal not that i need justification but i needed it for everyone anyways any time i tried to reach out and get help it always ended badly even my therapist said i should have chosen a more definate way of suicide as soon as i came out to my mother she only calls me by very feminine pronouns such as baby girl, mami, beautiful and so on along with constantly deadnaming me even when corrected and my father only talks to me when he needs something or wants to talk to my brother yet I am the family therapist and nobody can handle the truth that i tend to say because i can nolonger handle the bullshit they put me through i still have to live so that my brothers got a chance but as soon as i can get him out of here I am leaving and likely never coming back fuck this family and she keeps telling me that I am selfish and stupid and that nobody would side with me because what my dad did to her justified it and i should hate him for it so please tell me am i in the wrong or is it them Am I inconsiderate or is my mom toxic and my dad a dead beat I will likely delete this soon so please read this i just need one person to be on my side who is not in the situation with me",0
I am so tired I am falling behind in everything wasting all my time doing pointless shit to waste time. I feel like everyone hates to be around me. Its so hard to get up to do anything. I am always so hungry tired and feeling not great. I am missing deadlines for important things that I cannot care less for. I feel so miserable and just want a way out.

And the whole ""stay no do not kill yourself because people around you will miss you and be heartbroken"" yeah I am fucking sure they would, then they would not have anyone to be the goddamn adult despite being the youngest. They would not have anyone to take care of them. that is what they would miss. And maybe they should. I have told them countless times how I feel. They do not care. Maybe they deserve to be heartbroken. I do not deserve to suffer so why should I stay? Fuck this. See you next time. I am not enough to observe",1

"I am 25yo and I thought that by now I would be used to this feeling. But everyday it is just seems so hopeless, somehow I always end up fighting with someone I care about and end up feeling like I am the problem and would be better if I did not exist. I cannot see a reason to keep going, but everyone just expects me to be fine.I cannot make friends or keep them and always end up pushing everyone away thinking it would be best like this. In the end, the only thing keeping me from not terminating my life is the fact that I could not find a way to make it looks like an accident so people would not feel bad about it and this just adds more bad feelings.I am sorry for any errors, english is not my first language. I am just so tired",1

"I am going to be ending my school years in a few months, and I got out of a relationship almost a year ago, it lasted one year, I have been a loud and obnoxious guy ever since I was little, it helped me find people and try to fit in, but slowly I started to become more quiet and distance myself. I did not think much of it, until I got into a relationship an year ago, I felt good for the first few months, but deep down I knew this was not it and I knew I cannot keep her in the dark like this, I told her I felt alone, and that I felt as if no one really to appreciates me, she tries her best to comfort me, and to this day I will always appreciate itbefore I realized itjealousy guilt and mixed emotions fucked me up. we have had many fights, and we tried making things work for the majority of our relationship, this is not it. I knew that, and I knew I could not keep it going, so I called it off. I knew she was not it, and the breakup was in a way mutual because she confessed was losing feelings midway aswell, I felt like shit. but do I have the right to?I had a few friends before this, most of them were her friends, after we broke up.. nobody came to me, nobody even checked on me, not even my ""friends"". I felt so alone. but I knew this would happen, but it still hurts after we broke up I was still friends with her, it was poisonous. because it was tempting me to do it all again, make up, get together, and feel the same things again, and break upand I can tell it is bad for her too,we needed to part ways so I cut it off my ""friends"" and her, I told her that I am going to be cutting her off, and she respectfully did the same, because she knew it is the best thing to do as for my friends..? I do not even see them mention my name ever since I broke up, nobody cares.it is been so lonely. I barely even see my family either, and their not the type to understand, but I appreciate that they even let me stay in their life I have been craving attention, anything.. but nobody really caresas I said I have been quiet, I do not have the energy to try and make friends, or fit in I want to so bad but the fear of rejection and the thought of me just looking cringe worthy Infront of others plague meso I sit alone in my room, checking social media apps and seeing everyone live their life while I am daydreaming of everything I can never have my motivation is running slow and I cannot go a night without having a breakdown after midnight, and because of quarantine there really is nothing to do, so I do not have a better distraction but I feel so guilty for being the way I am, and I feel so jealous of everyone else. but lately I have been feeling something other than just loneliness, been feeling empty and just depressed, I have thought of suicide, but I have always thought about my family. the only ones that truly care, even if they do not understand or know what I am going through, I know they care.but it is lonely, and empty living like this, I play the guitar and sing songs every night, to do something other than staring at a screen but I cannot do it forever I am sorry for the lengthy paragraphs, I have wanted to talk about this for a long time, and I thought maybe this would be the right place, me being anonymous, so I will not get so much anxiety I feel guilty that I am here complaining about this, while I see posts about people going through tougher and more dire things I am sorry if I sound like I am exaggerating ): my dive into feeling empty and alone",0
"I have had depression for a long time. Actually I have cyclothymia with predominant depression. My longest depressive episode lasted eight years, and it started when I was 19. I did not even know what being happy was supposed to feel like. I was doing okay until the pandemic. But working in the ED has killed me. I cannot do it anymore. The job I used to love is now so stressful. I am getting in trouble at work for my interactions with others but I am hanging on by a wire. I feel so hopeless and like I wish I was dead so I did not have to feel this way (I am not going to hurt myself, I just feel so bad I do not want to feel bad anymore, but I am safe). I have been talking to my therapist and psychiatrist and we are changing my medications. I just do not feel like anything will help. The only time I was happy I was on a great medication and I had to go off it because of a horrible rare side effect. I had no choice and cannot go back on it. And my husband and I want a baby but how can we when I am like this? He is so wonderful at least. I have spent almost my entire adult life - a good 15+ years - like this. I feel like I will never be happy and stable for a good long time. So what is the point? Things are just really bad right now",0

I have a therapist but i guess I am ashamed to tell her. Feelings insecure about how you look is very very hard to deal with. It keeps me in bed &amp; sometimes from going out. I hate looking at myself now in the mirror. I be wanting to just breakdown sometimes. I put on this front like i love myself &amp; i think so highly of my appearance but deep deep down inside i hate the way i look, I am disgusted with myself &amp; it hurts.

"I cannot stop thinking about suicide. Everyday I wake up with more pain and emotional torture than the day before. I bought a gun the other day just to see if I would have the stones to pull the trigger. I just graduated college and I cannot find a fucking job. I majored in a boring, same old, subject that I figured would get me a job but do not really enjoy. I wanted to write movies and songs about life but I have no path to get there. I think that it is time for me to go. My family is the only thing that gives me pause. I cried as I pet my dog today but he was happy as could be. Sometimes I wish I was just a brain-dead idiot who could happiness in just simply existing. I figure I should write letters to my friends to let them know why and that they are better without me. I do not matter in the grand scheme of things so why stay here for people to bitch about politics all the time and argue over ridiculous stuff. I cannot find love and doubt I ever will, no woman can love a man that hates himself, and hates living. I have come to accept this. Nothing matters. I never did and never will.

My dad does not care about me at all because if he confronts my mom, she might divorce him, and he will not make as much money. I am tired of being third and getting yelled at. I am tired of living with my mom. I just want to sit somewhere and die. I think about dying and killing myself every day, but deep down, I know I am not going to do it, but I honestly do not know what to do anymore. Nobody loves me or cares about me.

My boss today sent an email that was unnecessarily nitpick-y and the rest of the day I could not smile or focus. Like...what about the stuff I did well. Now I feel like I am a worthless piece of garbage and I was emailed that critique in writing to add to my file for when they fire me. why did not my boss just ask me about that or why it was not done.I am 30 years old and here I am feeling like I have no idea what I am doing ever.

"I often find myself fantasizing about every aspect of my suicide. How I would go out, how I would be found, how it would effect others. I also fantasize about failing. I fantasize about lying on the floor covered in my own sick as an ambulance rushes in and saves me, and my LDR boyfriend comes to visit me while I am barely conscious in the hospital. Perhaps I just want someone to notice. Someone to acknowledge the fact I am suffering. I feel so unseen. All of my suicide attempts I failed on purpose because I desperately wanted someone to see that I really was doing badly and just wanted to be loved and cared for. I am in a position where I cannot seek mental help, and I know that I am awful for doing this. I am just so desperate for someone to care and check up on me. But as time goes on, I am tempted to do it for real. The only thing stopping me is my boyfriend and my grandmother. I have already hurt them enough. And I am afraid of failing. So Ill continue to live in this constantly dissociated state and kill myself slowly through self harm and isolation. Ill just keep floating along until I wake up from this nightmare. Venting.",1
"there is no colour in my life. nothing I enjoy. Why the FUCK AM I LIKE THIS. I am ripping apart like a shitty toy. I fucked my arm up again, cut it until there was nowhere else left to cut then cut a bit more. Everyone says hope is like a unicorn, hard to find. Wrong, It does not fucking exist. Anything someone says is hope is like putting a party hat on a horse and saying it is the aforementioned unicorn. If I get one good fucking reason why I should live, some real hope I will not kill myself. But I might as well do it now because it does not fucking exist. Asking for a reason to keep going just gives me a hundred other reasons why I should just end it tonight. I have already marked the artery that I will cut, so I am sure I will not miss. I am so devoid of hope I do not even know what it means. Everything's gone grey",1

"I am living with this family for almost my whole life. But my biological mother still had custody over me when I was a kid. I am about to move out and I hate the way life works. I was given everything; like I am living the best life a adopted kid could only dream of and I am still having suicidal thoughts. I feel like a fraud for having these thoughts. I am like a parasite. I am not going to kill myself until they die because I cannot bear the thoughts of thoughts of them missing me. Or thinking when they did everything for someone that would make any human being happy or set for life that it was not enough, like they were not enough and I do not want that to happen.

I do not have the strength or the will to be here anymore.I wake up and feel like I cannot breath a deep sadness washes over me.an emptiness.a black hole within.How can I live feeling like this? Its only going to get worse. what is the point?,1
Hello everyone 19(M) been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now. January of this year the person I loved the most and would have given everything dumped me and it is been really rough for me. Today I filled my mouth with my anti depressants just could not swallow them. Is there even a point of trying to live anymore? Does it actually get better? I truly do not want to be alive anymore I hate every second of it everyday I wake up in so much emotional pain. Faking a smile becomes harder and harder I do not know how much longer I can take Suicide and depression,1
Hi. I have been depressed off and on for 9 years and I was suicidal for the first 6 of those. I was glad to say that I had been doing better these past three years but in the span of half an hour my parents have been able to tear me down to the point where I am considering doing something terrible. I am so scared and I desperately need someone to talk to. I Need Help (Trigger Warning) NSFW,1
"this was my date last year but i was in a psychward so i did not get to do it. ill be following my dad out 3 years to the day in the same way. things are going good for me yet i still feel like pure shit and i do not think its ever going to get better because I am doing everything right and nothing works. i feel defeated. atleast ill be at peace with my dad. the world is not for me. i do not want validation just a place to vent i guess. everyone in my life thinks I am better so it will be easier to achieve. i hope you guys will get to do everything you dream of, everything you want to and live life to the best you can and do what you want, i have just under a month left to close all the gaps. i have a date.",1
"So I have always been a pretty even tempered person, but as time goes on I feel like I am always in the middle. No highs and no lows. I just have a general apathy where I do not feel sad or happy ever. I cannot remember the last time I got excited about something. I have tried doing new things like climbing some 14k foot mountains, ziplining over huge canyons (my heart rate did not even increase), making new friends, learning guitar, traveling, etc.. but I generally do not really feel much. I just do these things and think cool... I did it, shrug my shoulders and move on. I read online that apathy is a form of depression so I am asking if my situation would warrant a doctor visit? My situation is fine overall, I just feel like I am generally numb to it all and I cannot really point to any reason why that is. Does anyone have any suggestions to get out of this middle ground gray zone I am living in all the time? Is general apathy a good enough reason to visit a doctor?",0
"I am looking for a good book to read and learn from. Something that can help me learn how to be in more control in how I respond to daily life, criticism, uncomfortable or threatening scenarios, and just general positive and/or negative conversations.About me: I am someone who has been clinically diagnosed with PTSD with Anxiety attacks, depression, and general anxiety. I was raised in an emotionally and physically abusive home and suffered throughout life as a kid. Honestly, it felt like i was bullied and abused most of my life. Since becoming an adult and I am more self aware and I really want to turn things around! After being clinically diagnosed, I decided to pursue therapy. I was in therapy for a couple years but I ended up losing the privilege of having access to therapy due to insurance and being broke. I really do not want to take medication but its getting to the point that idc anymore and i just want to be drugged up. I really really hate how much I struggle with my mental health and I want to have this bitch in check and not let my surroundings or other ppl in my head. At one point in my life, before covid, I felt like I had (most of) it under control. Sure, I had my bad days still but nothing like before. With the pandemic, i feel my mental health has gradually gotten worse again. I freak out with certain triggers, i get scared of what ppl think or say of me, and its even harder when it feels the worlds against me when receiving harsh criticism. (Ex: my mother says things like: this is why bad shit happens to you or now i understand why you got abused) After I calm down from my panic attacks, I always feel so defeated and even worse. I end up isolating myself and just crying the rest of the day and laying in bed until the next day because I cannot stop replaying my life history. I WANT THAT TO STOP. I just want to learn how to stop letting things get to me. Basically learn to be careless or not care for all the right reasons. Sorry if my post is all over the place. I just had a breakdown right before typing this. -TIA Any good books/reads to recommend? Any helpful advice even?",0
I cannot do this anymore. I feel so alone. I feel like a voice drowned throughout the chaotic waves Hitting repeat is harder every day.,1
"I am tired of being on the verge of tears every night. I am tired of not being able to get help because of poverty and my deadbeat dad who does not give enough of a shit about me to get me health insurance again. I am tired of being afraid to talk about things-- I am tired of so being *so afraid* of socialization. I am tired of being selfish and feeling abandoned by my sister just because she is having a good time with friends. I am tired of her joy being my misery. I am tired of being awful, of suspecting that there is something wrong with me but not being to do anything about it. I am just so, so tired of everything and it is all adding up. I am reaching my breaking point. I cannot hardly cope anymore. I am tired",1
and i tread a troubled trackmy odds are stackedill go back to black goodbye,1
"Sometimes I think it would be better if I did not exist. All traces of my existence erased, nobody would suffer or remember me. That would be perfect, bc I do not want to die (or live either) or feel pain but I want to take the weight of living off my back peacefully. Life is not worth all the sadness I feel when I start thinking about how I am miserable. There are times where I am feeling good and think ""Life is good, after all. I want to live like this a little longer, I want to live"", but this happiness does not last forever and I start overthinking againI also feel guilty for not wanting to live bc my family is wonderful and I have everything I want. I do not think I have the right to be sad about my life bc I definitively could be worse. I live normally, I am not really sad or gloomy most of my days, it is just that I am tired and empty. I go to a good school, but now I hate studying, I do not want to study more in college and I do not want to work after that, but I will do it because I have to. If I am going to be forced by life to choose what to do for the rest of it, then so be it. I do not have a career I would like to follow, so I will just pick the one I hate least. Whatever, I am just a lazy mf that does not want to deal with hardshipsI'm young so maybe I will feel better someday. Perhaps one day I will laugh at how I was stupid as a teenager that complained about everything and acted like they were depressed, but until then I will just keep living i guess I am tired of life but I do not want to die",0
You ever just get out of a super anxiety inducing situation and just have a depressive episode and your too afraid of opening up and talking about it to anyone because you do not want to seem like a needy freak? Well I do. Or you want to vent to someone but do not want to scare them away. One of those nights.,0
"You will see me achieve and talk and tick items off my to-do list. You will see me laugh and apply concealer and wear outfits that appease the public. You will note me walking at a slower pace to my office in the bitterly cold mornings. You will see me sigh.You will see me buy coffee, many times. You will see me touch my outer thigh, you will see my hand linger and grip the flesh there in a way not dissimilar to a butcher testing the quality of a cut of meat. I will walk to my car, get in, rip off my mask to display an expression that conveyed more emotion with a piece of cotton covering my mouth. I am getting closer and closer every day. I am still too far. But I am getting closer.Soon you will see me gone. Soon you will see me dead. You will see me. You will see me.",0
"I currently live in the you.S. with my mother and my partner is from Poland. I would like to move in with them but it is a huge step that has given me a lot of anxiety. I think its time for me to commit to the decision or else I will end my life.I currently live with my mother. she is quite abusive in a few ways and she constantly controls my life. I am a gamer so of course I love to game and I can spend a lot of time on that. My anxiety and depression is preventing me from being able to continue college. I had to drop out after one semester due to it causing me to attempt suicide. I still do not feel ready to go back. I am 19 and due to the fact that I live under my mothers roof its unfortunately her house and her rules. I do not know if she means well the majority of the time. She says she wants the best for me and wants me to be something in life but just because I am not going to college right now does not mean I will never go, I am just not ready. She constantly takes her anger out on me and never apologizes. I often feel uncomfortable living with her and stay locked alone in my room. She gets upset if I sleep in late but that is my choice because I am not feeling well. I often stay up late and sleep in late, why should it matter to her?My experience with therapy has been awful. It took me contacting 10 therapists to even get one response. During therapy I have just been judged and my issues compared with others, and it has never helped. I had one psychiatrist tell me to just stop gaming completely when I use it to cope with how shit life is. My psychiatrist told me yesterday that my partner will leave me for being useless and not having a job. She also told me that if my mother were to die Id be taken advantage of and used in the system. It feels so fucked up that she would say those things to me. All I could do was cry. If I am being honest, I wanted to shout fuck you and punch her, but I somehow had restraint not to do that.I am 19. I have a lot left to life (and honestly I fucking hope I do not but Ill just say that because of reality) and just because I do not have a job nor am attending college now does not mean I am worthless. I do not understand why my life has to be controlled and I have to be forced to do things I am not ready for. College makes me suicidal, and so does my mother. I feel like its time to move out.The reason I am coming here to post about this is because is it really the right choice? I know there will be yes and nos, but I want to hear what others opinions are. I have been with my partner for just over 2 years and I have been thinking about this major decision for over a year. It gives me quite a bit of anxiety. I have never been to Poland, but we have met twice (would have been more if it were not due to the pandemic). I do not have anywhere else to go. My family is toxic as hell and none of my friends really have space for me to be there. I also will not be able to bring my cats with me if I choose to go. it will be a huge lifestyle change too. My partner has constantly reassured me that they will take care of me and I will have time to improve my mental health before I start making any big steps into the work force or college. Honestly, I feel like Id feel more comfortable doing things if I was there with them, because I love them and I am comfortable with them. I just do not know if making a drastic change to a different country will be worth it in the long run. I do want to move away from my mother but its so far and its so different. I do not want to judge. I just hope that I will be happy if I make that choice, even though I know it will be a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that it will improve my mental health in the long run and allow me to actually be able to control my life and be able to breathe. Maybe Ill actually find a competent therapist and psychiatrist there that are not pieces of shit.I am writing this calm as fuck right now but in reality my brain is spinning. I do not want to go back to my piece-of-shit psychiatrist in a week. If I cannot move out, I genuinely will kill myself, and I feel like moving is the better choice because knowing me Id fail and turn into a vegetable. : )I genuinely do want to die all the time, but I feel like if I can actually enjoy life it would be worthwhile staying at the same time. I want to make the right choice. I can move out but if I do not Ill kill myself",1

"I have struggled with depression for a very long time, and have had good periods and very bad periods. My depression took a down swing mid-2020 and I have been struggling to claw out of it since then. Recently my suicidal thoughts have been getting stronger and harder to reason beyond. I am at a point now where even at work I find it hard to focus on things without that part of my mind asking me to die. Does anyone have any useful strategies that they have relied on in the past to work through their dark thoughts? cannot think past my suicidal thoughts",1
"I used to be extremely hypersexual, but it was frustrating because I was not getting any. Citalopram massively reduced by libido and made it impossible to orgasm, but I did not mind this change at first. At one point I was taking 40mg, which is the highest allowable dose.After tapering off, my sexual function never fully returned and I kind of miss it. it is been over a year now. I was on the drugs for a few years.Prior to antidepressants, even at the age of 27, I would get random erections. I would sometimes get so aroused I would HAVE to masturbate or I would be agitated and could not think about anything else. Not to get too graphic, but I used to get a lot of pre-cum, and when I ejaculated I would squirt quite far, often over my head, and it would be A LOT of volume. It was easy to reach orgasm, and when I did they were intense.Now, the end of my dick is dry and lacks sensitivity. it is really hard to reach orgasm and I am significantly less aroused in the first place. I miss the thrill of trying not to cum prematurely. Now I cannot cum without vigorous stimulation and it does not even feel good. Did your libido never fully recover after quitting antidepressants?",0
"(Warning: I am kind of just ranting to myself to collect my thoughts)[17m] I do not understand it. Obviously I am in control but I constantly make stupid decisions, and I do not understand why. I think I am just lazy and I want to feel like there is a reason besides myself that I keep fucking up. Its completely stupid shit, like I do not do my homework because I do not know. I want to, it would not be hard, but I do not. So then I end up having a 32 ACT while having a 2.1 GPA. Another time I liked a girl and she liked me, and I just ghosted her out of the blue because well, I do not know. Did this to a friend of mine as well, and I do not know why. Maybe I feel like I am not in control because I am a moron and do not ever actually TRY to take control of my life I feel like I am not the one in control",0
"This is the lowest I have ever been in my life. My brother tried to commit suicide by overdoseagain. He lived. I have been struggling for two years. I got divorced after ten years and my ex got custodial parent. I was released from the military after ten years, due to an accidental chemical burn injury to the entire lower part of my body. I have not been able to work in two years. I received a diagnosis of sever dysplasia (precancerous cells in my overies) I have three operations to remove them. My hair fell out, and I struggle to keep my weight at 115. We cannot afford enough food for me and my kiddo, so I skip eating. I go to school full time online. The bills alone are enough to overwhelm me but the weight of the world is sitting on my shoulders. When my brother called to tell me goodby, this time, he told me why he wanted to die.I told him to fight to push past the shit in his head. In honesty I felt every single reason. I understood why he wanted to die, bc I been struggling with the same feelings. I cannot shake it, bc nothing is getting better. I still have a year of school to push through, I been applying to every online jobs I can find and continue to get scammed, I cannot catch my breath.

"The guy I (21F) like has been severely depressed for almost two years now. There have been times he completely blocked everyone out of his life. Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i breakLast time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions? I feel guilty and frustrated all the time. My friends even tell me i am a clown for texting him. I know its not true. But after two years i am doubting myself.Thanks Please help me idk what to do",0

I slept from 12PM to 6PM and did not leave my bed until 9PM. Only to get into an argument with my mother about how she is going to force me to get on meds again if I do not stop with the constant emotions/attitude.

"TW: Se*ual As*ult, s*lf harmim not sure how long this will be, but I just need to get some things off my mind for the time being. so hopefully this helps? my journey with depression started in 5th grade. I was practically bullied everyday, never physically but the words just stuck with me. 6th grade came around and my depression just slowly started getting worse. this is when my long journey of self harm started (i will not go into detail) but i got to the point that id do anything just to feel something other than sadness. this is when my friends slowly started to stop talking because they noticed the shift of energy. we were kids, we were not supposed to feel this way and nobody else wanted to be around someone that was like me. because of this i turned a majority of my time and focus to social media, i stated creating anonymous accounts just so i could have somewhere to express what i was feeling. i some how got sucked into a rabbit hole that lead me to kik. if any of you know, that app had been busted numerous times because of the child groomers that were on the app. this is when i had my first experience of being manipulated by an adult. (again, i will not go into detail but this happened for months). skipping to 8th grade, I am still self harming at this point. a friend ended up seeing the marks, which caused me to just change methods. Eventually, i did quit because i just knew it was time for me to give it up. From my freshman year to my sophomore year, my depression stayed steady. I was still experiencing suicidal thoughts, but i knew i was not at risk of going through with it. I wanted to die, but i just could not get myself to go through with it? i guess its a fear of not knowing what will happen after? My junior year of high school was the start of a downward spiral i would have never predicted to happen. I ended up losing my dad, we thankfully had a good relationship. i was 16 so it absolutely destroyed me when he passed, especially with how sudden it was. I ended up binge eating constantly because it was my way of trying to cope. in total i believe i lost about 4 relatives that year. a few months go by and i start talking to this guy, we end up hanging out and this is when i was sexually assaulted aka this is how i lost my virginity. the reason i feel so guilty is because i continued to talk to him after, and we met up twice after. i truly just wanted him to want me, the movies made it seem like losing your virginity was this magical thing. i just feel like people would say that i was not sexually assaulted because I continued to see him? but i swear i said no multiple times, i tried to push him off of me, i can vividly remember what his weight felt like i felt as if bricks had been stacked on my chest to the point i could barely breathe. to this day i can still remember what it felt like, it nearly sends me into a panic attack everytime.after this, i knew nothing would ever be normal again. i remember going home showering immediately and i just scrubbed at my skin for what felt like hours. you are probably wondering, why did not you report it?. i was scared, my mom thought i had been hanging with a friend not a guy 4 years older than me. in the moment i thought id be the one in trouble. this still haunts me to this day, i always wonder if there was more i could have done. i would try to think of any excuse for what happened. anyways, i had told 3 close friends about what had happened and my guy friend said , it sounds to me like something you just regret and that you are trying to make an excuse. which again, caused me to feel even worse. after this i just kind of used my body as a way to seek validation? i was constantly having sex in the attempt to make someone want to be with me. and that brings us to now, obviously there is tons of other things but this message is just getting too long. I picked up a few addictions along the way, but I am working on it. its been rough, and i wish i had the time to tell every detail but maybe one day. I have made it to 19, I have been thinking of starting therapy, and possibly getting a diagnosis. its been rough, and to this day everyday feels like a battle. but i refuse to give up, there is too many countries i want to visit. you do not have to read, I just need to rant",1
"I am a fucked up person. I am hammered from vodka and I have a knife with me right nowLife fucking sucks I feel like I do not belong anywhere I have horrible anxiety, self hate and ruthless depressionI should have appreciated certain people who were close to me more when they were alive I love my family and I regret being so cruel to my brother who would never hurt anybody My God I hate myself so much for that I want to do it",1
"I am horrible with words and conveying thoughts so a ""she will"" is the best way I can describe this feeling. I remember May of 2018 when I graduated from college. That was a wonderful experience and a serious milestone in my life. I was so proud of my accomplishment and was absolutely elated the entire week through the graduation ceremony. I felt excited to begin the new chapter of my life: starting a new job, making my own money, having my own true apartment. At that time I felt pretty happy.In January of this year I had been offered a new job (after searching for 18 months). I had received a 40% salary increase, had the opportunity to move to Atlanta and move back in with my twin brother. One would argue that this was a serious milestone I achieved after graduating from college. should not I be elated about this opportunity? I have been in the new job for 5 months, the new city for 3 months. As I am typing this post out, I am doing some serious soul searching and asking myself, ""How do I truly feel about this incredible milestone?"" that is just it, I do not feel anything. All I truly feel towards this is ""it is a milestone, and it happened."" Its like there is this she will around me that refuses any emotion from entering. I would hate to use the word ""dull"" but that is really what it feels like. The outward emotion that this entire milestone feels, just ""dull"". And yet in reality ""dull"" is not at all how I should be describing this insane achievement. Honestly, its hard to explain.Side note: I have not been diagnosed with depression but today at work my boss noticed I was making more mistakes than usual so he asked me ""Is everything going OK in your world? Atlanta still treating you OK? Just wanted to check in on you because its not like you to make mistakes. Let me know if you need anything."" Him questioning this made me think about the status of my mental state over the past few days and ""a she will"" is how I would describe it. And honestly I have felt this way for the past year almost, even at my old job. I have no one to talk to deeply about these feelings so I wanted to share here. Does depression embody a ""she will"" around yourself?",0
"This is a long story. Last August I ran away from my home. I did this because of a few reasons. The first was because I had been messing around with about 20 girls from all over the world and making them think that they were the only ones. My parents found out and were understandably angry. Over the course of the next week, I was miserable because I had to deal with the ramifications of it. Finally, I snapped at my dad, and he snapped at me. It ended with me on the floor and his punching me. That night I packed a bag and ran away from everything, my family, my problems, and just my life. Over the next 24 hours, I had spent $525 to get up north where a friend was living. When I got there, he, and few of his friends, and I went out for a bit and we ended up getting pulled over. The cop smelled weed in the car and took our names. He registered my name and saw I was a missing person, and brought me back to the station and called my parents. Forcing me to go back, they took every device I had and cut me off from the rest of the world. I had not been able to talk to my friend since, nor have I gone to my old school since. When I got back, they sent me to live with some close friends in the country. While I was there, I was absolutely miserable. I had no friends, no family, and no phone either. I also could run because I had nowhere to run to. I stayed there from September till December before they decided to move to Hawaii. Because of this, I had to move back. Since I have been home I have had no friends, no devices besides an old computer, and no money because I have to pay off some things to my parents. I feel lonely, and like I am trapped. The sad part is that I felt my happiest when I was on the run because I did not have any expectations of myself. I could be whoever I wanted to be. Now in July, nearly a full year since, and I am the most depressed I have ever been. I have no freedom. I get what I did was bad, but I was also a stupid 16-year-old kid who wanted attention and love. I was not a popular kid, and I never had any close friends except for the one that I was going to live with, but I do not have a way to talk to him anymore. I cannot call Suicide Prevention because I do not have a phone, and I cannot talk to a close friend because I do not have any. I cannot talk to my parents because they will say it is because of the choices I have made. I am just so tired and lonely. I am just so done with life. I do not know if this is a cry for help or my last words. I am laying in my room with a ring of knives around me. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not know what to do anymore",1

"I am writing this while drinking a bottle of wine while crying and as the title says, i think I have instantly hit rock bottom, i thought i could not get any lower, when you try to come out about my depression here i am. I am planning on killing myself soon but i just felt i needed to put this.I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts, the notion of wanting to not have been born feels natural. I think it started when i was 4 and getting beat and locked up in a storeroom at home and getting bullied in school.One of my first memories was of my older sister getting dragged to the storeroom to be locked up while I stood there crying, thinking back, this might have been the first time i disassociated from reality i still remember how it felt like i had no control over my body just watching the movie play out. I try to pretend like those two years do not bother me but it does. I can still clearly see flashes of those 2 years and i hate it.There were about 3 points in my life where i resolved to kill myself: When i was 5, where a kid who was bullying me bit me on the face for using the toilet before he did and i was blamed by the school for starting the fight, i remember that was the first time i seriously thought of ending it, nobody would believe me because his friend said i started it. This was the first time you locked me in my room and looked out the window of my apartment and thought long about jumping. Eventually, i pussied out and i blanked out for a long time after that, i cannot even remember what happened after that it felt like memory only resumed after i saw my abuser get punished at 6 years old.The second time i resolved to unexist was when i was put into a school far away from my home, i knew no one there and as a person who is bad at talking i naturally got bullied, my already shitty health got worst, i had terrible stomach pains particularly in the morning, i was afraid to leave my home. My books were glued, table vandalized, i felt the whole class was against me. Then one day when a guy was pouring water on my table I snapped, i think i had my first anxiety attack, i pulled his arm hard thinking of smashing his face in, but then I instantly started crying, i felt intense fear, my heart was beating out of whack I felt like everyone was laughing at me, i could not breathe, my stomach churning, and my mind went blank. My teacher talked to me after class but at that point, I have fully disassociated I do not think i heard anything i just went ok for everything. I started skipping more classes feeling like my room was the only safe place, i fell asleep almost every night crying about how big a disappointment i was to my parents, how useless i am, i have no talenfs, i was only a burden on everyone, the only thing i deserved was to die. i was planning to do so but once again i pussied out my useless urge to live won out, because a man on youtube saved my life, he was a comedian from sourcefed at that time, his name was Steve Zaragoza when i was 13 he was pretty much what was keeping me alive with sourcefed table talks, and what he said i think pretty much saved my life, he said the stopped getting bullied because he became the funny kid. So i became the funny kid, i started craving attention, everyone liked me, i was the goofy fucker, one of the class clowns, but that was only temporary.The urge to end it lessened and i soon started going to the gym.I was getting better. I was at 105Kg (about 200lbs) back then and through out 2 years i lost about 30Kg ( about 65lbs). I thought that at that point i would feel happier and more confident i would become OK, but it did not the thoughts at the back of my head still remained. i went off the diet and i gained back all the weight by the time 6 monthes passed, every though i ate normally, this shit just made me give up hope losing weight.The third time in the past i tried to end it was when i was in 2018 (at about 17 and 18 years old) , i went into the school i wanted; the school and course my parents wanted i thought i was happy my sense of self worth was at its peak and i thought i had made my whole family proud being the topp 10%, but of course again i was wrong i could not handle the pressure of my course, i coundn't wrap my head around the subjects taught and from that pressure i decidedd to run away i skipped my, classes, my exams, dropped ou, planned to work for a while go on holiday and then end it after the holiday settleing some loose ends. I Planned to die, did not decide the method this time but it was what i felt was rock bottom. I never tried to tell anyone besides as disgusing it as a joke to friends, never said anything to to family, or to any doctors i just kept it to myself, because i thought no one deserves to be burdened by my shit and i was embarrassed and scaredBut i think the reason i did not kill myself was my niece, i watched over her often as my sister was working and her father was a piece of fucking shit. I felt like i was her father i felt like i had to be there for her, i did not want her to have a shitty shildhood, i wanted her to grown up healthy and sane.Turns out i was ok with working i enjoyed my time talking to customers, the pay was enough, for me, and i felt like my life was amounting to something i felt sort ok and then covid came knocking and the lock down began. The lockdown brough my family closer, i soon had a nephew too and felt responsible for him soon after. I wanted to be there for them. I want them to be fuckin normal people unlike me me. I wad happy for a whiel.Now brings us to current times, lockdown is over, i was conscripted into the military like every other man in our ountry. I went through my 1 month basic trainig thinking, i would get a job that would let me go home everyday like a 9 to 5, but i did not, i had to stay in a military camp from sunday night to friday, i cannot see my familt, the thoughts were getting more and more frequent and i after just a few weeks of staying here the feeling of it feels stronger and stronger, but i could not just leave my friend to handle everything, so i endured for a while.Yesterday at the military doctors office i just blurted out my anxious feelings and some outher shit that i could not put into words properly and he asks me to come back later but with my superiors and 2 other random guys in the office, i choked while they accused me of lying and lectured me about growing up and just deal with it while i was too nervous, i could not form a sentence, through the doctor saying why i did not highlight the issue to previous doctors, it did not make sense for me to say it now. I fully disassociated. I did not cry i just agreed with what they said like it was the truth, i had once again truly decidded to kill myself after 3 years.The first time i try to tell anyone about my issue did not belive me and instead put me through a interrogation, discredited and berated me the entire time. I have hit even lower than what i thought was possible.There is no hope, there is no meaning, i should not exist. My life has ni value. My wine is done and my drugs are in me hopefully this is my last day. Also sorry about the errors and long post. Good afternoon good evening and goodnight. Instantly pushed to rock bottom",1

During my pregnancy I had it all planned out and planned to take my life a few days after she was born. But I did not and I regret it. I regret bonding with my child because it makes it that much harder to do what needs to be done.

The only result I get from it is ugly marks and having to waste my time stopping the bleeding because I do not have any bandages, even though my mom is a nurse and bandages are so accessible?I am supposed to go to the beach on Tuesday, and I am terrified. I have scars on my leg and my entire family will see. Ill probably get into another argument with my mom. Its not like she cares, anyways. My family does not care about me at all, my friends hate me, I cannot control my emotions, everything is so difficult. And for what? Why cannot everything be easier? Why does the world have to be so toxic?I am sorry for my rant, I just do not know what to do. I just wish things would end. I want to end it. Please. Its getting worse.",1
Hey guys i just want to vent out. It is my final year of high school and there was this competition in our maths class where we had to come up with real life solutions using maths so i did an alternative method of launching payload which took me months to do but other classmate just copied a covid problem from the net and presented the teacher who was supposed to select students for the competition picked the other student even though she said i presented better and i spoke better but they have covid releated problem so they get to participate instead. This is just one case this is happening throughout my school life. I cannot even say i lost a competition i never got chance to even loose. Just months of hardwork wasted again and again and again. I am done with this plus being called the n word and being constantly being made fun of due to my skin i have no confidence in my appearance and today was the last straw which took out a little bit of self esteem i had of my mind. Guess i am just rambling on at this point but if you r reading this iust know you r the person i have talked most in the past few years so thanks for listening. Goodbye Loser,0
"I cannot take it, why to be afraid of the death and the hell, if the true hell is here, with us on earth. Everything's wrong, since the usual people, until the big governments and rulers of the world/countries, everything is rotten. Every individual of this human race is a monster and a living dirty piece of shit. Everything is wickedness pure. I cannot keep lying, this human race disgusts me so much that it literally makes me sick. Right now I am sick, I am sure that is because of my hate to this fucking world. Every fucking day, everything I see I do not like. This can sound dumb or something, but I cannot even describe my infinite and impossible disgust to this human race. our rulers are equal to the most ruthless and disgusting serial killers, terrorists and dictators that ever lived. Everything is connected. Evil is everywhere, evil is simply masked, but it is always fucking beating. I myself know that I am a very bad person, I hate myself being human.I do not know if my words sounds logics or not, but this is what I think. I want the third fucking world war, I do not care anything, I just want death to this rotten human race. I feel like I am in the wrong reality, or the wrong world, I do not know, just I do not like. Someone here does get what is like have an intense hate inside? I know living with hate is a torture, but I cannot avoid it, I feel everybody are all my enemies, fuck, I do not know how I will keep living with all this hate. But yes, human race is a cancer so so so disgusting. Besides that, I feel dead, I have always felt like this. the planet earth, the only planet with known complex life in this disgusting galaxy, so many years in which humans have inhabited the earth, what have they been for? If the world continues to be so bad, we are not moving forward, we are going backwards. Shit. The human race is sentenced to burn.Well, this is my post, I just wanted to say it. World is the absolute epitome of the hell",1
"Last week I did the most disgusting thing by cheating on my husband with his best friend, who was the best man at our wedding. We have only been married for a year and a half. We have a 6 month old son. He found out a couple of days after it happened. I feel disgusting and awful and that I devour any happiness he once had. I think about disappearing constantly. Every time I am in the car I have an urge just to drive into a tree. I cannot believe I have done this to such a beautiful person. I feel like I need to remove myself from existence so he can start to heal. I deserve everything bad and terrible. I do not want to because anymore pain. I need to disappear.

"I must have done some really fucked up things in my previous life to deserve this. I do not believe in god and I am not spiritual in any fashion, but hypothetically, damn. I know this is a massive exaggeration but I feel like I must have been Hitler or Genghis Khan or whatever in my past life to deserve this kind of pain.&amp;#x200B;I have suffered from depression since I was 14 (at least, maybe 12 but it is so hazy- I am nearly 22). I finally got treatment at 18, and I am starting my ninth antidepressant since then (Viibryd) tomorrow morning. I have been deluding myself for the past 8 months; I increased Wellbutrin this year and it helped some, but it seriously amplified my anxiety, which I have been trying to treat since then. But I had my psych appt yesterday and we discussed tricyclics or Viibryd, and I went with the latter because I would heard good things about it for TRD, and especially TRD with anhedonia. Despite the bad side effects. My pharmacy had to order it and I picked it up tonight, but since yesterday I have been reading and panicking.&amp;#x200B;I had a lot of hope yesterday; I imagined a life where I actually wanted to do something. Anything. A life where I wanted to talk to people, be social, be adventurous. it is in my nature but depression seriously mutes all of it and I hate it.&amp;#x200B;I hate this shit. I hate the 9 meds and still daily suicidal/self harm thoughts. I hate that I cannot get a MAOI. I hate how hard it can be to treat depression. I am just so defeated and angry at this point. I DO have hope for Viibryd, but I am also terrified because Trintellix (in the same med class) did not work at all. I hate that it seems pretty clear that I do not have another possible diagnosis. I am just so fucking frustrated and I needed to unload so I hope you all are somewhat nice lol A rant about my inability to find relief",0
"Is anyone else struggling with this? Some background, I grew up and watched my entire family die off before I turned 30. I was there for most of it .. so much fear, pain, and suffering... it was just awful, awful stuff and I would not wish those experiences on my worst enemies.I am not religious or spiritual... I suspect death is final. That being said, I cannot wrap my head around the meaning of life. It is absurd. How can we possibly believe our small accomplishments are significant when there are billions of humans, trillions of lifeforms, and all of it is just a speck of dust in a larger solar system, in an even bigger galaxy, in a possibly infinite universe? The social constructs we create to box ourselves in and make sense of the senseless, the narratives we tell ourselves over and over again, the cognitive dissonance we experience when contemplating our own mortality ... all of these things are evolutionary defenses so we continue to feel good about ourselves, procreate, et cetera.The obvious answer is to stop analyzing it all and just enjoy the ride, but as I am getting older I find myself obsessing about how I am utilizing the precious time I have left. Do I sacrifice the present to provide a comfortable future for myself? What if I die tomorrow? And after all these thoughts, I cannot help but thinking *what does it matter?* My wife wants to have kids but the thought of creating more life that will inherently suffer and die makes me nauseous. Each year seems to pass faster than the next and before I know it, if I am lucky, I will blow through middle age and be facing down death sooner than I expect. If I were less afraid I would kill myself, but something is better than nothing and the idea of nothing terrifies me./rant. Anyone battling similar depression and anxiety? How do you cope? Life is frightening and I do not know how so many people are so well adapted to the chaos. Crippling existential anxiety after losing all my family",0

"I think I hit my low. I have no more motivation for anything. I slowly have begun to ghost my closest friends and will not return texts. I physically cannot find myself doing these things. I have cut contact from most people other than my girlfriend. I feel so empty I do not know where to go from here. The longer it goes the more I begin to rethink my relationship with my girlfriend, who I love very much, and start to overthink every single aspect of it. This is not healthy and I fear it will end my relationship. Maybe I am deeply insecure of myself, but I cannot seem to tell what is my thought vs what is the depression talking. I have never been like this in my life. I have been with my girlfriend for over 6 months now. She was clinically depressed when we met, and she is now medicated. Her strength to keep going is something else, and its what makes me love her even more. But I am afraid its broken me. I broke down in front of her and told her how I felt. She comforted me and we plan on figuring out the future when we get back from a trip we have planned in august. Some backstory. she is at a crossroads in life where she does not know where she will be in the future. We just both know we want to be with each other. Its the uncertainty and love I have that are creating a war in my mind. I just want to be stronger mentally to handle myself. I hate that I have become like this.

"in talking with other people who struggled with suicidal thoughts in middle/high school this seems to be a common struggle. I am nearly 21 and i honest to god thought i was not going to live to 18. now I am here and I am so lost in what i want to do with my life and how i want things to turn out, and i still cannot picture any kind of future for myself beyond where i am now. i just moved from the USA to the netherlands, and for anyone who is gone through a similar move you know how isolating and terrifying it is. i feel like I am out of my depth, like how could i have possibly thought this was something i could do. I have been struggling a lot the last couple weeks with (mostly) passive suicidal ideation, something I have dealt with since i was very young. sometimes though it is not passive anymore, and i go to sleep every night thinking of ways to just end it because life is too much and I am not worth the effort for other people. idk, its been a rough time lately never thought id reach my age and now i do not know what to do",1

"I ruined my life. I used to have all those YOLO moments. I am a funny and very outgoing person in the outside. Getting asked out by men. Always a boss fave coz of my work ethics and get all my tasks done. Then something came to my life. I ruined my life. I resigned from my work because I do not have anymore the will to move. I even filed a vacation leave for 3 months to find myself back but i failed that is why i resigned. I had a boyfriend. We broke up but we still keep on touch. I went back home to my parents. I isolated myself from my coworkers and friends. Unfriended all of them. Nothing on my social medias but my family and followed pages only. After unfriending them, you will really know who is really concerned and truly loves you. Its been 8 months now, and did not talk with other people aside from my family and ex boyfriend. I tried to apply for a job so it will get me busy again but after they gave me an offer. Thinking that i will be out there again talking to other people and i will be back to my old YOLO me, get me so tiring and loss my will again just thinking of it. So I declined the offers.I do not want my parents to worry about me. So i help them with household chores or cooking for meals. I had small talks with them so it will look i am okay. Then go back to my room. For 8 months that is my life.I workout and meditate in my room almost everyday hoping i get back my will to live. But it failed.I have this plan last december on how to kill myself. This is not my first time. Tried hanging myself last october. But it failed. Lucky no one found me. I just woke up from the floor saw the belt i used snapped.The only thing that make me looks calm in the outside coz I already have my deadline for my death. I already have this very neat plan. Recorded a good bye video for my parents and sisters. Before hanging myself again. All my social medias and accounts will be deleted. I am just now waiting for my money i earned from my sidework so i can drop it to my parents account. This is my first time posting with audience. I just always post all my feelings in to my private secret IG account with no followers and followings. Ruined my life. cannot get it back on track.

"Around the start of may to the middle of June, I was at rock bottom. I told my psychiatrist, I went to inpatient, changed my meds, nothing helped. I had a manic episode which led to a suicide attempt. My 13 year old brother walked in and I realized that maybe it was not my time after all. I called my dr. she put me on mood stabilizers.I am 16 and after all of this, my dad decided that it would be best for me to get a change of scenery, so I went to stay with my aunt in TN for the rest of the summer. She practically raised me and I had been every summer so I was down. My mental health has never been better. I stopped self harming. I brought my summer school grade up from a D to an A, and I have spent so much time outside its ridiculous. I have motivation again but despite all of this, I still have that ache in my chest.Sometimes those thoughts will creep up and Ill think of how things are changing and they will never be as good as they were this summer. Ill think of how I am going to boarding school but I am not going to be good enough and I am going to have to come back to my toxic household. I feel so much better than I used to, but the thought of living life still feels exhausting. Will I ever be truly happy? Will I ever be truly happy?",0

I just want two supporting parents who can afford rent every month and have enough money to buy the things I want.

"I just wanted to write this out but do not know exactly where then I remember reddit is the only account nobody in my family and friends knows. Well, this is my first time writing this kind of thing so please be patient with me.When I was still at school (I am an adult now) I sometimes think about suicide because of how bad my environment and the people around me treated my family, but I could never ever do it because it will make things even worse for my mom and I never have the courage to do so.But ever since I lived far away (because of work) from anyone I know throughout my school years I have never thought of suicide for one bit despite having lots of hardship, that is until I have to go back home. ""Family"" and ""friends"" I never believe in whatever that term is supposed to mean, they say ""family/friends will always be there to support you""...f-ing bullshit.Well what I am trying to say is every time I am around family/friends (basically people I know throughout my school years) it always makes me feel like reliving my younger self and I hated everything about my childhood I f-ing hate it because it makes me feel like I can never do anything and always thinks that suicide is the answer even though I know it is not.Writing this down made me calm and I already forgot some of the things that I was struggling with at that moment. I do wish to move away again and do therapy but financially speaking that is not an option.To whoever is reading this I thank you and if my words are quite hard to understand I am still learning to better my english.

Next year, i fell to a girl who was gorgeous and intelligent, but got rejected. You know the hard part is not getting rejected( she was polite with me )is realizing it was useless all long. I was stupid and thought that being nice was enough. It is not. I forgot the pysical part and its Its all my fault. I am ugly, do not know jackshit bout dancing, is geekish/nerd etc I am not the badass bad boy, hot AF surfist/gym guy. I am not charismatic. I never had love experience. Instead of that,I got Asperger and AHAD, uglesiness, and weird hobbies like likening geopolitics, antropology, politics, not simping 20s, choosing my crushes bc of various reasons, not just looks like my mates do,hating governments and shit. I am not taking just about a GF, I already lost my hope of that. I try so hard ( I always accept going out with them, try to enjoy myself with them, etc.) but I feel like I am wasting the best moments of life. I try, try and try, but always fail.

"I cannot even put it in to words how I feel because 1. I am no good with words and 2. I do not understand my feelings. I cannot seem to relate the feeling to anything else that I have felt, its a distinct feeling. Almost like a total change in my senses, my outlook on life. Its an overwhelming sensation that makes me feel dead in the inside, a horrible groggy feeling. I read into peoples behaviour and I am disgusted by it. I see how selfish humans are and I wonder why no one can see I am in pain. I think people do not really care or want to understand how I feel. I think I am selfish for being this way. I think that I am a liar when I am not in that state of mind and struggle to believe my suicidal feelings. Describe how you feel when you are suicidal.",1

"Hey all, first time poster here. I need some help.Not too long ago, my partner suddenly decided to cut-off all relations with me, and it seems she no longer wants to be associated with me anymore. Apparently this was because her friends did not approve of me or something (?) she explained how she still liked me, but her friends thought that I was weird (despite them not even knowing me) so ig she just felt embarrassed being around me, and so decided to leave me. that is essentially the message I got. honestly I am still so confused. she went from totally being in love with me for awhile, then decided to break up with me seemingly over night. just because her friends did not like me or whatever.I spoke to a close friend of hers about it, and they had their suspicions on jealousy and peer pressure which seemed to make sense ig, but they also had no idea. I was not particularly keen on them asking her about it.Idek, but I am absolutely gutted. I honestly loved her so much. I have been feeling so depressed lately. I literally lack the motivation to do, well, anything. I have not eaten much since then, and I cannot even concentrate in class properly. Its horrible.

"So...I am not the type of person that you would describe as depressed - I am going out, meeting with friends, smiling, laughing - looks like a normal life.Though, due to my social anxiety (on which I am working on with my therapist), 99% of the time I am not the person that engages any activities, I would probably sit at home instead. Sometimes I am getting some worse feelings - not strictly suicidal, but let us say staying near the cliff and asking myself ""what is going to happen if I jump"", or even sitting at home and wondering, if anybody is going to miss me if I die.It got worse last year, when I was on a one-month sick leave, with friends being overloaded at work/not in the country - we have had contact only through messenger (I do not like speaking to friends on the phone, I know they would talk to me then), and developed to the point where I realised that I could be in toxic friendship, just to not end up alone. It was last month, when I started therapy - although now I feel that I was not honest with myself during the sessions, leading to put focus on something totally different. Right now, I am at the point, where I am permanently sad, with depressive feelings for like 90% of the time - when I am talking to somebody it disappears, but it is just temporary thing - few minutes later, after we end up a convo, I am again feeling like a shit.I have tried different things - riding a bike (leading to some stronger anxiety attacks), playing a games, cooking (making me sometimes crying because of awful results), and dozen different things where I have just lost motivation.For sure I want to talk with therapist about that, but I am afraid that at the time of the session I will forget about it (as I mentioned, when I am talking to somebody this feelings are disappearing). Have anybody of you experienced that? How did you cope with that? Is it depression?",0
"I am tired of it. I am seriously done. I feel like nobody in my life actually cares about me, as much as I try to think about it. I am selfish, I am conceited.

I feel like I cannot even tell my feelings to my boyfriend anymore. I am selfish for that. Nobody includes me in things. I am a nuisance ever since I moved homes, I am in the living room, on the couch, I am a living burden. I am genuinely convinced that if I put a bullet through my brain my family would throw a party. I am literally useless and my only redeeming quality is draws good and where will that get me? Suicide. I fucking hate myself. And I am seriously considering it. Seriously. I am convinced thoroughly that I am just a nuisance, a burden, a waste of space and air and oxygen and that I am just nothing in the world.

"One night I told myself what do I have to lose. I was tired of living because all the things I do, even if it does put a smile on my face deep down inside I still hate myself. In my head I had so many racing thoughts about trying to convince myself that I want to die and just how people are going to think after I die. I got up and I found some Advil in the cabinet that my mom forgot to put away with all the rest of medication, sharps, alcohol, etc. I said to myself you are a pussy, you will not. So I did it, and I was ready to end my life. I took a ton of Advil along with my evening dose of Lexapro that is given to me day by day.An hour later, nothing happened to me. I felt as if I never took down almost half a bottle of pills. My stomach did not hurt and I never threw up. Well it turns out the pills were expired. After my parents found out what was going on, I told them I wanted real help and they said the hospital was not real help and that they are not going to do nothing for you the but just drug you and control when you speak, when you walk, and when you blink. From all these shows and movies, they think what they see in the movies is true and are thinking they are going to put me in a stray jacket and a padded room. They did not want to take me because it would of showed that I went to the hospital for an suicide attempt but they were more worried than that rather than getting me the help that I need.In the past I was in outpatient for six weeks so I do not see why going back to a mental health center or hospital cannot be an option for my recovery. My parents refused to take me to the hospital for my suicide attempt.",1

I want the afterlife to just be one big dream where I can have the happiness I want but without worrying about waking up. Everyday that passes I want to just wake up the next day and have everything be back to how it was 3 weeks ago and maybe have that be a bad dream instead.

I am not even sad that I am suicidal, I am just pissed that I know I am too stubborn to change. it is not like I do not want to change, I have wanted to get better for like 3 years but no matter how much I try or how close I come, I always end up being the same asshole who puts on a facade for everybody he knows so that nobody has to worry about him which only leads to him trying to kill himself. it is happened 7 fucking times, you would think by now I would try to stop this trend but whoopdi-fucking-doo I am unable to change and fetishize my own sadness as a result. I unironically said that I am happiest when I am at my lowest, which is so fucking stupid but it is not even wrong!

"So I have been feeling this way for, well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example, I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar (I work at a tavern) and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty",0

And she is also anorexic she only eats 500 calories a day. I found out when we were dating that the reason she tried to kill herself was because she thought noone would ever love her flaws and all i thought of how i told her i thought her cuts were beautiful (never encouraged it) and how she must be happy now. And then she broke up with me over some stupid shit on my end and now i have no one and apparently she is already with someone i feel she might have been lying to me. It does not help that I have been upset over her since march before we even dated.

Every day the symptoms seem to be coming back harder and harder and I am finding myself sleeping less because of it.

"I believe that materialism, technology and social media is really fucking people up. There seems to be a level of competition with everyone, wanting to look the best, have the best things and post it all over social media for gratification. Wearing expensive brands seems to be the norm. People spending all of their money on ridiculously expensive clothing and jewellery all for a social media platform, for likes, for this shallow gratification. The cliche saying of loving things and using people seems to be getting stronger and stronger. I feel the worlds priorities seem to be so out of balance. We have everything we need for a happy life here on earth and still the system and the way we live we have created this competitive, unloving, uncaring, selfish, greedy society.Idk, maybe I just was not built for this. I used to work in sales and that was such a toxic environment where is everyone out for themselves. where is the empathy, where is the community, where is connection. I feel as a society we are losing this. I wish I knew how to fix this. Suicide rates are sky rocketing and its no wonder why.I think I suffer from low level depression and I am from a loving family and have an ok standard of living. I cannot imagine what it must be like for some.Maybe I have a pessimistic view on things at the moment. But my emotions and my thoughts lead me to feel this way. I am trying to practice self care more and more: meditation, good nutrition, exercise, reducing my alcohol intake. But still there is this underlying dread and fear that as a society we could be literally living in heaven but instead we choose to live in a low level dystopian world.Is this a warped perception or reality which I have created in my own mind? Does anyone feel the same? Is todays society the problem? Or is it me?",0
"Some people practice positive thoughts, some try correcting their negative one, some do affirmations..I just want to know how the brain works. Is the brain like an empty glass that you fill up with thoughts, or is it more like a computer where you have to delete data before adding new ones.I feel like I inevitably come back to my old thinking, as if I am stretching out my brain when I practice positive thought but it always come back to its original form.. it was feels unnatural to me to practice positive thoughts..what do you think? Is changing your thoughts possible and how would you go about it?",0
"it is really easy, I have a lot of love to give but none to myself. If I do not love another it will be wasted. So I spend it all on others so maybe they will love me back and in turn I will feel loved. I cannot do it, I have tried this self love business. Self love is not easy as I have never been loved, not by the ones that were suppose to love me. They sparked this fire of self hate in me when I was a young child. Their hurtful words have become my own. It is not their voices I hear anymore but my mine, god she is a bitch a right fucking cow. Loud and mean always got something smart to say. I tried saying something nice to myself but it sounds strange and really fake. So I am on rollercoaster of always healing, but never healing. The good days are scarce and the bad days feel like a long winter night and I am locked out of the house. I feel so alone in this. I close my eyes and think if bear it all if I hold on for a little longer, maybe I will be saved. Maybe who knows I will be among the lucky ones who is plucked from the crowd by a saviour. Oh god even writing that did not make me believe it. How can you truly love someone else if you cannot even love yourself?",0
"Hello, I am seeking advice for my depression/addiction. Growing up, I was bullied until the end of high school and my strict religious parents created a very stressful and traumatic upbringing at home. I have always had an unshakeable feeling of low self worth and I always feel like nobody likes me. I always have to go above and beyond for people to like me but others seemingly do nothing and have people adore them. In addition, I have an over obsessive addiction to things that stimulate me. It ranges from food, movies/tv, theme parks, etc (no alcohol or drug addictions). Really, just anything that prevents me from sitting with myself and my thoughts. Literally, I cannot do anything without simultaneously eating a snack, or listening to music or a podcast or something to stimulate me and make me feel happy. I am addicted to this self induced false sense of happiness because its the only time I really ever feel happy. Over the years, I have made excuses/goals to help me with my depression and low self-esteem. First, I blamed it on my weight, then my lack of education, then my finances, then being single and alone, etc. Present day, I have my own place, I got fit, completed multiple degrees, have a great paying career, I am in a 6 year committed relationship, and I have even mended my strained relationship with my family. Honestly, I have a great life and I have run out of excuses. HOWEVER, my self worth is as low as ever and I still feel like people do not like me (or think the ones that do, will leave me the second I do something wrong or upset them). I have been seeing a therapist for 2 years and it has helped me to better understand the root of my behaviors but no luck finding a solution. I am continuously told to try positive affirmations but no matter how much I repeat to myself you are smart, you are worthy,etc, or how many lists i write with my positive traits, nothing changes. I am not suicidal or anything like that, and when I reflect, like I stated earlier, I am aware I have a great life but the thought of living the rest of my life and never being truly happy or loving myself is so scary and I do not know what to do.Anyone in a similar situation or have advice? Thank youPS: I have never taken meds. I always avoided medication and thought of it as my last resort but I am starting to consider them.

"Imagine if you wanted to die, and you could just swap lives with someone instead. Maybe a 89 year old or a 5 year old. would not that be weird? is not it odd how some of the of us try so hard to die while others are doing everything they can to survive? Imagine if you could donate your life.",0
Easier said than done but Hold as long as you can I do not know what to say but you are not alone trust me even if its someone across the world,0
How would I go about it? I want to die peacefully while listening to my favourite music. Do I drive out into the woods and connect a pipe to the exhaust and into the window? Help! I just want to die in my sleep Carbon monoxide.,1
"I do not know why I am so damn emotional tbh; weekends have not really held a lot of significance in my life. Probably feeling this awful because I know this could be the last, and lasts...ugh. I miss the firsts. I suppose I will not have any from now- unless first successful suicide attempt counts, lol.do not know what the point of this post, or that of anything at all, is. I guess what I want to say is enjoy your firsts, try to atleast. Yeah. that is about it. Hopefully my last weekend.",1
"I hate myself for what I did to me and the others. I want to stop existing so badly, I really do because even if I had everything in this shitty existence I would still think the same, a family to live for? Even if I had one who is worth it, I do not want a family (toxic or not does not matter I just do not want a family), friends? I do not have any and I do not want to have because they are just going to use me and throw me away when I am no longer useful to them, but you know even if I could have a good freind I do not want it because I find interacting with humans boring, to tell you truth I think about dying everyday and that thought crossed my mind a billion times, I am not going to lie, I already tried to end it with a knife in my heart but I could not do it.. lol I even failed at my own suicide, living or I should say existing (because I am not living) become exhausted, I mean how can you find joy in this world when ure mentally numb, I do not feel anything, and I am my religion it is taboo to commit suicide,so I have been thinking about this subject 2 years and I did not even find an answer to my questions, so rn the only reason why I did not tried a third time (yeah the second time was when I was trying to suffocate myself but did not work unfortunately) is due to my religion. I am a hopeless person, I trie to be nice to others even when they insult, hate me for absolutely no reasons and I hate myself for it, and my dad told me that when I was a child I almost died, I was sick and instead of taking me to a doctor, the woman who gave brith to me choose instead to go shopping, and my dad was against it but he did not want to start a fight so he let her go, while I was suffocating on the arms of my dad(and to this day, my dad and I are the only who knows about it) , funny right? But I do not blame her (even if she is the because of my childhood trauma) and if ure suicidal then I am sure you know why I do not blame her :) it would because I wanted to die that day but god chose to let me live unfortunately.Anyway sorry for wasting ur time if you read all this, it is just that I wanted to express how I feel because it is the first time I can.. Good luck if ure suffering too. do not read it waste of time :)",1
"Hi everyone, I am kind of lost, it is kind of hard, I will try my best to explain everything, but I need you guys advices, or at least know what you think about all of this. Also, I do not know if it is the right subreddit to post in, but all of this really makes me feel depressed. I am a 24yo European dude living in a small town in France. I had a classic scholarship until 18yo. When I obtained my high school diploma, I took a 1 year break from everything, then did 2 years of college in language studies (English + init. Japanese). Those years I was living with my now ex-girlfriend. She literally did not care about me at all while I was driving further and further in depression. that is where I got my new passion, thanks to some YouTube vloggers : Japan.Life has always been boring. Where I live there is no future for anyone. there is no job opportunities, it is depression land, clearly. I am telling that to add the fact that I have always been seeking for a great life. School advisers and parents always made me understand that having dreams and stuff was stupid, that I had to be realistic, and choose a classic path. I was against that. Back to my college years and the revelation, I decided for the first time of my life to dedicate myself to this dream : making my life in Japan.It was tough socially, because people used to think I was a child loving anime and being delusional. But living in Japan and learning Japanese was things I took very seriously, I literally spent night and days studying the language, and learning about the country, the good and bad aspects, the social codes, etc... everything that I could get with the Internet.I signed up on some penpals websites, I was chatting around with some Japanese boys and girls, and then this girl e-mailed me. I do not want to say too much about it, but we ended up together, we already met a lot (well, not since COVID-19), and it is been 1 year and a half now. You know what? I think it is the one, so far. we will see. Anyway.I really studied ways to go living in this country, because it is tough.First I wanted to go to a language school, but I needed a LOT of money. I also wanted to do a working holiday visa but it also requires a huge amount of money. let us remember the fact that where I live, there is no job offers, and I am not exaggerating : the equivalent 3/4 of the population of my town is registered in the French work agency (those agencies under the government who deal with job offers and jobless people, that is just how it works in this country). So school and WH visa seems they are impossible goals to reach.A friend of mine already working in Japan had a job offer for me as a graphic designer in Tokyo. Guess what? I am doing graphic design since the age of 11. I have a professional level, I can totally work in this domain. So this friend wanted to recommend me to his manager to hire me when the borders are open.The problem is, and that is what I learned today : they were forced to hire someone else because the borders are not going to open until months. Which was obvious but I was still believing because, it was the best opportunity I ever had in my entire life, to finally quit this boring life in a small town without any future for anyone, and be who I wanted to be in Tokyo, with the dream job, living my best life with the girl I am planning to eventually marry one day.As I said, I was believing, so I was already saving money thanks to a 1 year help from the government (so 500 per month for 1 year).Today, the day this door closed in front of my nose, I am just sad. I dedicated so much time studying paths to reach my goal, every single path became a closed door. Is my destiny being stuck here to my parents house forever?I just lost every single bit of motivation, for studying the language, for keeping it up and doing things right for the future I wanted (and still want). Happiness is forbidden. All those efforts to be back stuck in the initial position, AGAIN. it is like seeing an open door, approaching it, and seeing it closing brutally to your face. I tried many ways to achieve my dreams, everytime it just failed. I do not know what to do anymore, I am just lost. there is my girlfriend waiting for me, we did not meet for so long, and there is my willing to finally start my adult life. what is the point of all of that if life keeps slapping all the doors to my face like this? And it is also about people around me : everyone were so hyped up for me to succeed, and I am just failing again.Today I wanted to read my books about Japan and study a little bit, then the news came out, my friend told me that they hired someone instead of me. I just spent my entire day looking at the ceiling, trying to not have a mental breakdown. Happiness is forbidden",0
"Like how low can I go to make a song about my life sucking... it goes like someone come kill me dududu, I just want to fucking die. Someone come kill me dududu, please just let me die.

"I am not sure if I should submit my question to a professional. So that is why I post it here first. I am 35 years old and actually not happy since my puberty. My life does not seem to get off the ground. My younger brother is now married and even has children while I see obstacles everywhere. I have a few friends I can talk to but see less and less. Because they are now also getting married and having kids. I do not feel connected to my environment especially with the people everyone seems to be only concerned with themselves and winning, I am not interested in more and more and mainly looking for a friendship while most people are only interested in transacional friendships. Bought a house (noisy) that I regret and am very sensitive to noise and what people think of me. Most people all seem to function on some kind of autopilot. I do not know what to do with it everyday becomes more and more heavy. Am I suffering from depression? I do not know what to do anymore",0
"I think I have been depressed for years but nothing compares to how I have been feeling the past few months. I have only ever thought about dying in the past but now I see things and go to places and gather a mental list of how I could actually do it. Its messed up but I even hope that some kind of illness does the job for me or getting into an accident. I have thought about it so much that I did not even react when I almost got in a car accident today. Everyone else in the car got a fright and screamed but I was just disappointed. How fucked up is that? I did not feel scared, I just wanted it to end. And I used to think to myself if I am going to live then Ill give it my everything then I would go and get straight As and workout daily to try to pull myself together. I do not know what is changed but that mindset does not work anymore. I feel helpless and I do not want to talk to anyone about it because I know that no matter what they say it will not help me feel better. Then they will either get annoyed or bored because I am a shitty person. I am so numb",1
"it is hard. I am finding even when I am barely waking up, my mind is already off to the races. In this constant search for some form of answer or conclusion as to where my inner critic became so harsh and what caused it.it is like my brain is constantly quantum computing, trying to add up the traumas, the emotions, all these images that reside in my mind. Scanning, calculating, trying to figure out the absolute source but I know deep down there is no ""one source"". That does not stop my brain from trying before that critic starts to scream some more. It will not be long, but maybe I can track it. Figure out the reasons it surfaces but sometimes it just seems to be from nothing at all.it is a scary thought when your brain turns against you. That saying ""depression is like living with a body that tries to survive and a mind that tries to kill you"" I am paraphrasing because I do not know the exact quote but you get the idea. Take a breath",0

"My mom found a bunch of old pill packages from when I did pills. I have been off of them for almost a year, and my mom is convinced they are new and I am going to overdose. I tried telling her that they were not from any time recent. She just says I am lying and now I am grounded from my friends. She goes through my drawers and searches my room. I am currently 17 and feel like I should be granted some form of privacy. She outright said she was going to continue going through my room and is convinced she is right and I am lying. I had a drug problem in the past so this kind of behavior would be normal 2 years ago, but after almost 2 years of sobriety from hard drugs, and the work I have put in to mend my relationship with my family, I feel like my effort is being ignored and my mom continues to call me a liar tomy face. She always pushes her religion on me, and will not allow me to be vaccinated due to her believing that vaccines are the mark of the beast. Yet I am the one who needs help.

"I do not know if this is just a normal reaction to a prolonged exposure to suicidal thoughts, a sort of ""numbing"", but it is creeping me out.

I know nothing changed but my outlooks become dark and I cannot change it back to how I used to see the world. I have a few friends who I hang with from time to time but feel no enjoyment with them at all. My real friends are all over the world and Ill probably never see them again in my life. I cannot talk to anyone about how I am feeling because those friends do not really care and my supposed family does not do much talking.

"My husband told me a few months ago that he is depressed. I have noticed his overall mood, treatment towards me (not abusive just can be very short and does not really want to talk or do anything with me), and treatment of himself had been going down (not working out not showering not eating well etc) but did not think it was really bad. After a few months of me being supportive and trying to help in any way I can think of he finally said he needs to see a doctor. I was excited about that; he made no effort to make an appointment and has no general doctor. So I found him one and made him the appointment which he went to with no upset and actually for a few days he seemed happy about going and being put on some meds. Hes never been a good eater and ever since the depression hit he is been worse. I have noticed he is probably lost 20 lbs at least (he was super thin to begin with). He used to be super active as well and now he will not even go on a walk.Last night at around 3am I woke up to an incredibly large thud outside our bedroom door. (He works late or stays up late every night and I normally go to bed at a normal hour). I rushed out of the bedroom to him crumbled on the floor passed out. He actually damaged the wall some with going down and now has a gash in his shoulder. He came to pretty fast but was overall super pale shaking nauseous etc. He would not let me take him to the hospital or is not letting me call his doctor today. I am not sure what caused this but I started tallying his calorie intake and he is getting around 1000 calories a day at most and when he does eat it is normally complete shit (soda chips and cookies fast food etc). he is over 6 foot and in his mid 30s. He now has high blood pressure and high cholesterol along with other health issues. I am now super worried and he still has not eaten since he passed out. I just would like some help on what to do now as now I am almost worrying of I am dealing with some sort of male anorexia and not just depression. I wrote him something last night telling him that not even eating a child's portion of food everyday nor taking regular showers is unacceptable. I do not know if something like this is ok for someone with depression or whatever is going on though. Just asking for tips to help my husband",0
"My safe option was always by drug overdose. My moms a doctor so that should be easy. Nuh-uh, not easy at all, do not recommend. Its been 3 days and I still feel like shit, my hearts beating like crazy and I can barely move without getting dizzy. I did NOT sign up for this. I want to kill the pain not because it. I thought I was just going to sleep then not wake up. Well I did wake up and now I have diarrhoea. Are you kidding me? Most of the other methods are way too painful and dangerous if I do not succeed. What I took was supposed to be lethal for an adult and I am barely a teenager. Goddamn immune system. I probably will not try for a while, I do not want to feel like this again. I hate this. Why is killing yourself so damn hard",0

"cannot even muster the energy to deliver my rant. Which is actually just a series of observations about the realities of living in modern society, feeling unfulfilled with the progression of life, and the brutal ways people treat each other in the name of profit. The same observations I have been making since I was twelve years old. But I guess I do not really need to do that here, we all know more or less exactly the way each of us feels about how life works, it is why we congregate in places like these. People think we are looking for advice, or sympathy, a shoulder to cry on. In some cases that is true but when we have reached the end of what we think we can endure and we are sitting in front of our screen holding a bottle of pills, or that length of rope we have been tying over and over to get just right (would not want it to fail when we need it most) We Know that noone has the words to give us to make it better. That magical set of words that will fit in a character limited text box, and will wipe away all the sorrows and pains of our lives. The miraculous advice given by a stranger that knows nothing of the specifics of our hardships, that will rejuvenate us and show us a new light that will guide us in life. NO. We came here for ourselves. Our last ditch effort, our last vestige of hope that by sharing our stories and our plans and our pains, we can gain the clarity and strength we need to keep struggling through these trials. Or that with the commiseration of those that see the world the way it truly is, we will finally find the courage to end them. I hope you discover, in the process of releasing yourself, the Will that you need to keep on fighting for your life. Until I find my own way to that decision, I am still here, Riding The Fence. -Apathetic Humans are scumbags.",1
"Sorry for the vent, not doing so hot at this momentIf I do not find a job that can support me with less than a 40 hr work week I really will pass awayWork has obliterated my mental health. Absolutely minced it.

I drink pretty much everyday and I have perfected the timing so my parents do not know I drink. Life has lost all color. There is almost nothing I have that makes me happy anymore.Idk what I did in my past life to deserve such torture. I think about suicide everyday.

If you are close enough to want answers and track down this account, you probably already know why. It does not seem like there is anything I can do to protect others from her, but the things that led here are Lucie's responsibility more than anyone else's. I figure there is a decent chance of success with a wrongful death suit, but going after her license does not look like it would be fruitful- I am not sure Heidi would cooperate with an investigation, and there is not enough hard evidence to prove the more serious allegations if she does not. I had thought I had the responsibility to make sure she could not hurt anyone else before I go, but I do not think there is anything I can do. I am not sure it is worth the grief if it will only result in a slap on the wrist, and evidence does not exactly suggest that the board are zealous defenders of responsible, ethical practice. I wish there were anything else on my mind in the end, but I have been trying to dig myself out of this hole for so long, with little else to distract me, and with nothing substantial waiting for me outside of it, that there is nothing else left in this moment but unmet, basic needs. Maybe try to help someone else. Pay attention, offer a hand when you can. Just be present. The small things matter. Should this have a witty title?",1
"it is an honest question because sometimes when this feelings try to fight their way up I am usually doing or thinking anything that can take my mind of it and sometimes when I think about maybe letting this feeling have their moment, I feel this big load of tiredness like it costs me energy that I do not have. It does not make sense to me because those are my feelings and I have dealt with them pretty heavily for many years, so why do they suddenly seem so overwhelming? I mean they are my feelings, I know them and they have always been there but suddenly I always feel so uncomfortable about them and it is weird when I feel the tears come but then a sense of tiredness comes over me and I cannot cry anymore. Is this just normal? Normal for people who have had some though times? It just feels weird to be overwhelmed with my own emotions. Too tired to feel? Does that make sense?",0
"Feeling suicidal and actively depressed. But if you ask me to talk about it, I cannot. Years of pushing away my feelings, now I am so out of touch with them, that I do not understand what I am feeling and even if asked will not be able to explain. Just overwhelmed by something I do not understand. God just want to jump in front of a truck.Argh. Completely out of touch with my emotions",0
"I feel empty and tired, what even is the point of living if we are all going to die anyway. I am just trying to keep all together for the people who loves me cuz I know they are going to be devastated when I kms. But shit it is hard and exhaustingI just want to take a rest forever like die peacefully in my sleep and be forgotten by everyone. existing is exhausting",0
"If i do not escape this place by next year, I will kms. there is just no other way and I am already reaching my breaking point so I am in desperate to leave I am tired. I hate this pandemic",1
"I am just over it all, I feel like I have no purpose and also just do not really care about anything. There is not anything left for me to do here",1
"I just do not know why, it just become cringe. Everytime I remember it, it always make me feel like that is the most cringe thing i ever done. I sick of my brain, everyone that time said that I am not that bad and trying to improve my feeling but guess what, IT BECOME CRINGE FOR SOME REASON. I WISH I NEVER HAVE BRAIN the time that I tell my feeling to everyone is now become a cringe memory",1
"what is the point of living, parents are not alive anymore I am useless and hate myself have no money, cannot find a job, 5K in debt, starting college soon but might drop out going to kill myself",0
I do not feel any happiness neither do i feel sad. It is just well i guess nothingness. It feels kind of strange i guess. I used to be just normal but now i do not know what i feel like. Not saying that i am depressed but.,0
"So uh yeah as what the title says, I fucking had enough because I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts with 3 years plus self harm. My family do not understand me even if they see me doing it they still tell me that I am looking for attention even I have been talking it seriously. School does not help out too because they seem to keep telling me how I am being lazy to not do my work and they clearly do not give a fuck about my feelings. Is there any good ways to kill myself I am already planning to do so I want to kms",1
"Now to patiently wait for the meds to start to affect my liver. Hopefully it will start fairly quick and then within a month or two, my time will come. This med did not because my original liver injury for years. But hoping due to previous liver injury, that it will start up quickly this time. I just lost my best friend of the last 4 years. He much rather go drinking and partying every night and give minimal attention to me. I now do not have any friends. I am lonely as hell. On top of that me and my former friend is coming up on the anniversary of the suicide of his past girlfriend. it is on July 26th.I wish my original drug induced liver injury killed me. I was close due to malnutrition while recovering from it. This time I will not stop the meds until hopefully the end or until I reach the point of no return. Thankfully I am already skinny as hell, as I am 5' 6"" and 107 pounds. So thankfully if the liver stuff does not get me, hopefully the weight does. I hate have severe ptsd. It also ruined my friendship.FML Just restarted my antidepressant 30 minutes ago that caused a drug induced liver injury 2 years ago",1
All that matters in this life is bringing yourself to a place of total joy and bliss. If you are blissful by your own nature then every drop of life is enjoyable no matter what it is. You will also overcome all obstacles seamlessly.Other people's judgements are not coming from a place of joy. If someone is truly joyful in their life they will feel no desire to judge needlessly and instead will be focused on enjoying their lives. These are not the people to concern yourself with. do not worry about what others think,0
"I am having a really hard night. Bad panic attack, thought she had finally had enough and was going to leave. For most of my life I have constantly considered ending it all. Extreme depression, anxiety, and a deep hatred for myself have been with me for 40 long years. Despite this, I am still standing, I am still trying, and those rare moments of joy and comfort make me believe its worth fighting on. I hope all who see this do the same. Its a really bad night.",0
"I am never going to get anyone to understand the constant feeling I have of not wanting to live, but also being incredibly fearful of death. I cannot be the only one who feels this. This world is so draining to me and I just do not want to be in it anymore. Its too much, but I also do not want to die because the thought of that abyss just sends me into a panic. What do I do to deal with this. I do not know how to explain this to people:",0
"For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we have lost interest in caring for ourselves.there is no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?I have grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just do not care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely do not see one for myself and I am not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.This has to be the worst part about being depressed. it is an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that is not the scariest illness then I do not know what else is. Seeing yourself getting worse and worse and not caring enough to do anything is the worst part of depression.",0
"I have 11 days until my lease is up. I went and got a job at McDonalds today because I have no other options. I sat on my ass for 7 months doing practically nothing. I have had almost no motivation to do anything. I have been on medication. I have seen a therapist. Yet I still feel this way. I have been applying to places for weeks. About a month ago I was emailed by an Empower retirement recruiter, asking me to apply to a position. The pay would have been the most I have ever made. I have heard nothing. I even emailed the recruiter. Nothing. So Ill be a McEmployee making almost nothing. Crazy how easy it is to waste 7 months of your short life. I do not have a real plan other than to live out of my car and use a gym to shower. I am taking classes next semester too, but Ill probably drop them all again. Wasting more money and time. My car does not start sometimes. I have almost no friends and my family is not the best. Oh and I am about $10k in debt. what is funny I have no one to blame except myself. I put myself in this situation. So hard to believe this is who I am and where I am at. Sorry for complaining I just want attention I guess. What a sad excuse for a human. Soon to be homeless",0
My dad passed away in January of 2012 and eversince then my life's been going down hill. He elft me a very hefty inheritance but they say not even money can save you from the sadness. I am never truly happy. I fail at relationships. Whenever I get happy something bad happens. My mood swings are very bad. At one moment I am happy and the next I am feeling sorry for myself thinking of suicide. I do not want to kill myself but at the same time I do not want to be alive. Life is a gift. But I cannot live it like this. I hope that one day I can be able to overcome and beat my depression. I hope I can be able to live a happy life. I am living in the wrong timeline were I am always sad.,0
"Hello, for the past two years now its been so difficult to leave my bed. Every month gets worse. I wake up late and stay in bed till about 5 pm and then I will get up and maybe eat or get something to drink then go back and lay down and repeat. I have a therapist and tried several meds. Currently on Sertraline and Wellbutrin. I recently started trying to make a checklist but never did anything. I applied for social security, got denied and appealed. I have not finished that second round of paperwork and cannot bring myself to do it. I think it is already too late anyway.I am curious what being happy and carefree feels like. I have no hobbies or wants, but I would like to. (I have tried several things and I fail and get back into a depression episode.) I feel like I genuinely want to get better and am trying but I keep self sabotaging and its getting worse.I feel useless and unworthy. What options are there for me and for people this far gone? I currently live in Vermont and am a 23yr old Female. I have had depression and severe dissociation for as long as I can remember. Any advice? Staying in bed all day every day",0
"I just need some support. I am dealing with a lot of stupid shit, and it is piling up again. The worst of my problems is a head injury from over 3 years ago that is still fucking up my day to day basis. I get exhausted easily (mentally and physically), I cannot remember shit, I am always in pain unless I take my prescribed drugs or drink, and now people have been making me feel bad about it. There is nothing I can do. I am seeing a neurologist Friday. But right now, I just need uplifting words. Please. I am so depressed today",0
"I will not go on a long ass post on why I hate myself or why I feel sorry for myself at the moment. My whole life is kind of shitty, alcohol, coke, ketamine, sleeping pills etc are the only things that make living bearable. Just like the title says: the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the guilt that others will feel after I die. that is it, I am blackmailed by my own guilt and its a fucking rancid reason to be alive. Someone try to give me reason better than guilt. I live hundreds of miles away from any family and my best friend killed herself when were 18, if you can try to give me a reason or even reason with me Id appreciate it. I am sick of living my life in guilt, this is not a way to live. The only thing that keeps me alive is guilt",1

"I have felt this way for a long time, I think about suicide for hours everyday. I cry 4+ times a day, everyday for years now. When I reach out to mental health they hang up on me. I have tried calling from other numbers and they still hang up on me. It feels like a sign that I am supposed to have no one to reach out to.

Activity Suicidal Since 5 Years Old",1
"I do not debate with myself anymore about the outward circumstances impacting me. It feels like I suffered deafness from sudden impact to my mind. I can still see, hear, feel what is going on around me but it is all muted. I have become so detached I am starting to not even ruminate on things anymore. There is just silence. A stillness inside. An acceptance. A knowing: this is what life is, this is what people are like, this is your life. Meaningless receptor of pain. A type of damage and grief that is so large it has become a void inside me without echo. I just exist in it. Laying staring in the distance. I stopped fighting. I lay dying figuratively now. Just darkness, the silence, the depth, the fright, the terror. I feel like an helpless animal that was being attacked so at first I fought frantically. Now I just lay no longer fighting back, not crying though the pain is present, being terrorized abused, destroyed. I am disassociating as I lay dying. My breaths are heavy like my mind. I do not care anymore. I am free falling in slow motion in the void. A ghost in a she will. Does anyone else feel this way? Did I explain myself well? When it all became silent",1
"I could really use someone to talk to. All of my social circle is asleep/unavailable. I was recently forced off of my meds (lost health insurance).

"I am have a really, really bad existential crisis. I do not remember exactly how it started, but I think it started with I am going to die alone because I do not want anyone in my life and people stress me out. Then I started thinking I am going to have to kill myself before I get old because I do not want to die alone. And finally, we are all going to die anyways, so what is the point? that is where I am at right now. I hate it. I am not motivated I do anything because it all comes back to what is the point? I also have had depression for a long ass time, so this on top off what was already there is just hell on legs. Today has been worse than usual. I have always hated being emotional in front of people, but recently it has just gotten way worse. I am now actively shutting off my emotions. I do not feel like crying, even if I do they hardly come out. The word emotions physically makes me cringe. I feel numb now. Can someone tell me how to live again? And please to tell me to give life meaning. Do you think I have not tried already? Can you give me a solution?",0

"Maybe then I could find peace or if not God or whatever could make sure my family would be okay after it became too much for me to handle. I cannot though. I cannot believe in a God that would allow so much suffering, not just to me but the millions of others with depression, rape victims, assault victims, cancer patients, people who never find love, people who get theirs love stolen from them. I just, fuck, I do not know and I may never know at least in this life. I say to myself a lot that the only reason I am still alive is my family but I do not think that is true. I am also scared of what comes after or, I guess, what might not. This is not to say I do not want to die though or that I would regret it if I did. Just, yeah, those are my thoughts. I wish I was religious",0
"I am someone living in Turkey. My age is probably lower than yours . I am here posting this, so may be someone can help me decide to do something. Forgive my grammar mistakes.Something happened today and let me begin explain stuff. I am not good at explaining things, forgive me.I was that toxic, ugly, awkward kid you most hate in middle school. I could not talk with people before that time then I got the courage to be myself for some reason when I was 13, then I became the most toxic person you would see. Problem is, my actions are stupid. I really do not know what I am doing. I act like a 2 year old child. My selfish feelings was at its peak, I always acted like my body is not there, sure they can hear me but they could not see my weird actions. People see me as a weirdo, they hate me and I did not care like that is their fault. Then when I reached 15, something happened. Like I realized everything. My stupid talk, actions, trying to be funny stuff etc. I never had a best friend until that age. I met someone. She liked me and I loved her. I was still acting stupid and weird. But I was going down. Then that day when my parents made me lock myself in some room, hurt myself and cry like a baby. again. My dad was kicking the door and yelling me open the door. It was happening since i was a child. It was because i did not wanted to go out. I was so anxious that someone see me and recognize from school. I was going outside with a jacket even in summer. Then my mother picked the lock and they saw me trying to peel my face off with my nails lol. Days later we went a psychiatrist and he told my parents that i was afraid of people seeing my richard in my pants. We took another psychiatrist. Paid so well and went outside of the city for that. Diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety. I was on some medicine from that time. He asked me if sometimes i wish to be dead. I said sometimes. He wanted some tests, brain scan, blood etc. I could not give blood because I am scared of needles. And it is not like ""oh that is going to hurt"", its more like ""i can cut my arm open with a chainsaw if you want, just do not put that needle on my skin"". I grew with needles as a child. He said all the tests are ok and told me my parents that I am psychotic or something. A month later my depression was pretty much gone. But in that month, i tried to suicide 2 times. And it all went wrong. These were my first times I hurt my first ""best friend"". I had no friends but her. Then I apologized so much for thinking about suicide etc. that is the moment where Walter became Heisenberg. I was so toxic smallest problem would grow up like a huge rock and I was thinking about suicide and crying. I gave up meds, every week i was taking handful of ssris trying to die in sleep. It did nothing except destroying my stomach and sleep. I was talking so negative BUT selfish with her. She were trying to support me and she were crying with me sometimes. And I started to use it to feed my ego. Everytime i got sad, I cried like a baby and she hug me in whatsapp. I became so toxic, everytime she say how are you, i was saying i want to die. It took months but she finally had enough. She were saying ok go ahead and do what you want. I always felt as I love her so much but she is seeing me just like anyone else. Even she says opposite. I was afraid of asking that if she care about me sometimes and from that days i went into full time job asking her if she still care about me 12 hours. Of course she started to ignore me. And i was aware of it. It went even worse, i was being hostile if she says yes instead ""yess"". Hours later i find myself apologizing to the rest of the day. This took months. My family finally knew i had a friend. They of course, do not like me having friends like they did when i was a kid. They were like ok but anytime they see me talk with her, they were saying that ""friendships end after sometime, its nothing important in your life, go study"". Oh also i never gave a sht about school since 8th grade. I was afraid of being seen, closed my instagram, snapchat (yeah ugly people use it too) and removed people in whatsapp. I was ignoring my meds and my social anxiety was still there. I think it is genetic, since my father has the same issue and my little brother, when I go out, my body starts to shake, my eyes could not find a spot to look at and i sweat a lot. When i try to talk i did not know what to say, my voice never go loud enough. This is another problem. If i cannot go out, i will not find a job, i cannot go to school, i cannot have fun outside being social as a teen etc. This is the point where I am now at my 90's waiting for god to end my life. My life is just stopped. I am lying at the bed in home all day. And parents yell at me all time for it but who cares. People do not like me when I am outside, they would laugh me, follow me i was even afraid of someone would go hurt me outside. I was closing every window at home so no one would see me. Still, we were friends. My only fun times, talking her, calling someone for first time, playing games, laughing, talking about other people, having fun.. but oh, gray ticks. And she is online. Oh yeah, she never loved me, I am nothing for her. Why not go shot myself in the head right. This went for a loong time. I could not stop myself acting that toxic. Its like, everything makes sense at that moment. You been lied. She is just making fun of you. Hours later, i cry, apologize and the day is over. And maximum a week later, it happens again for some reason. She had enough. It was my last time doing it. I swore that i would never act like that again. And i never acted like that again. But i was still feeling it. I was trying to hold myself till it all becomes colorful again. Then we met. In real life. Went to their house, met their parents, went to the beach, took photos etc. It was my best day in my whole life. I am in love with her i think i must accept that. Oh btw we had an ig account for me, but we both use it. its still active. We post stories etc. We could not wait to do it again. But she has another friends. It was still hurting me to see her with her friends. I would ask if she ""love them more than me"" if it was a year ago, but i got over it. That hostility feeling was always there. But i tried to hold it. Sometimes i could not held and we fight again, eh.. i fight again, but we were good. Untillll... Today. it is special day or something next week, we was going to meet again in hers. The day started all good. She were online, not answering. I did not said anything about it, then she said ""sorry, i was texting in group, did not saw your message"" i said its ok. We talked, laughed and while we talk, my brain is like ""oh she were talking to another friend, she does not like you, you think she is having fun talking with you? after everything you have done?"" she was having fun talking me sometimes. Only sometimes. I could not hold it and said; ""if you were talking with someone else you can tell me, no need to hide its ok, those days are over."" She said that she is not lying, but i could not believe it. I had no ability to let myself think about it for a moment, and i were saying ""no need to hide"" etc. She went offline for 2 hours, i cried cried and she finally replied. She said that she would forgive me if i shut up. I said ok but at least tell me are we completely fine? She said .. My pain was at its peak. I told her at least tell me are we going to be fine again, i feel so bad etc. She said ""no, i do not care about you, real friend would not let me hurt, fill me with complete negativity everyday, i do not love you anymore, you hurt me and i still talk with you. just shut up we cannot be fine anymore."".. I paralyzed for a moment and asked her give me one last chance, and i will change, i will not hurt her anymore. She said ok, and now we are fine i guess. Umm, people, I am not going to change. I am toxic af, i do not deserve to be alive, or live life like others. I mean it, its nothing like ""oh help me help me, should i die, yes yes i die please make me not die"".I have one last chance. I have 2 options. First one is.. Suicide. I would never ever hurt her again, i would not worry about my bad look, my future, my past, people etc.... But my family would hurt along with her. She would not feel that much i think but still my family would fell down with my death. Actually, only my mother and brother would. But they did not like the way i go. And if i cannot change myself, i will already kill myself at somepoint. They know that. Second option is risking it. Trying to change. I cannot meditate to change my personality and focus in my breathing. it is like faking it. It does not feel well. I cannot take therapy as i hate doctors as they just put me on a different ssri and anti psychotic. also do not have money for that. No, i just do not want to take therapy, it feels wrong. Feels like it will not help. I feel like i cannot change.Any options other than suicide you see? Any suggestions? I do not know i just wanted to explain things. Please do not tell me stop talking with her, i cannot. I love her more than anything. I am sorry I am being such a toxic asshole but i could even leave my family for her. Except sometimes. Sometimes i hurt her and myself with my feelings. But i still cannot give up of her. I love her more than anything, and i want she if not the same, just love me like she do others. But sometimes my brain says she never loved me.I am not feeling much atm, I just wish i was never born. Please say something, i like to talk. I do not know, convince me to suicide if its ok here, or do the opposite with the reasons. Tell me I am the most toxic asshole you ever heard of. I do not want to leave my mother with pain, but i do not want to risk it. How can i change? Just, yeah. Please help me. I am a horrible person.I wrote too long, apologizes. I do not want to check what i wrote second time because I am too lazy, and it does not matter anymore. I cannot give a fck if i look awkward somewhere in the text. I am already a horrible person. What would it change..Thank you. -Some Baby Acting Toxic Ugly Asshole. Hello people.",1
"It does not matter if I am rich or poor, no one will ever remember me. I could dedicate my life to helping other people, but even they will die one day. Disregarding that, they are insignificant, like me, in the grand scheme of things. Helping them does not matter. Same with animals. I am more drawn to them because their emotions are simpler, but they do not matter either.I am not smart enough that people will remember me in the future. Even if they did, our planet is like a drop of water in an ocean. It does not matter.I sometimes think that life would be worth living if I had a relationship. But she will not matter either. Its just a temporary distraction from the void. Honestly, at this point I keep living for my dog. I know that she is immaterial as well, but I cannot quite get myself to leave her alone, having been with her since she was a pup. My parents will probably collapse without me, so there will be no one to take care of her. Once she is left us, there will be nothing holding me back.I wish I could swap lives with someone who is terminally ill and does not want to die. They can make use of my life. Ill be more than happy to give it to them. Purpose",1
"Well it is most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there is a chance it will be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that is already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It was not there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it is spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I am scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that is always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I do not want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I do not actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I am scared for that; my first biopsy did not give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. I am terrified of that happening again.I am just so full of uncertainty and I am scared and I feel like I am not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I do not get to be upset. But I am. But I do not want to be. I am conflicted. I am upset. I want to sleep so I do not have to feel.Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways. The cancer has spread to my liver",0

"Hi everyone, I am new on this app but find it comforting that I am not alone. I have been in the blues for awhile now, just cannot find anything to live for really. And what sucks most is I have everything. A loving and caring family, a roof over my head and three meals a day. Clothes on my back and even extra. I find it pitiful that I feel this way, I feel ashamed. Because people dream of the life I have, people have is so so so much worse. I just graduated high school so I am in that weird phase where I really do not know what I want to do. I do not want to go to college because I do not want any debt, but all of my friends are going. I phrased friends because I do not really talk to them anymore. I made the biggest mistake by giving my ex 100% of my time, leaving none for my friends so I do not really blame them. I do not find joy in the stuff I used to do and I cannot find any joy elsewhere. All I do is work, and good lord do I hate working. The day I find a job that I do not feel miserable at will be the best day ever. I hate that I feel like this, because I should not at all. I hate that I am even writing this looking for sympathy for my little sorry ass. But I really do not know what else to do, therapys not for me and if it were not for my mom and my coward self I would have put a bullet in my brain by now. But I know I have to keep on pushing, because I could not live with my mom having her only son kill himself, even if I was not alive. What to do",0

Last time I was around anyone my age without supervision was....6? 6 years ago. I do not even know if that is abnormal or not..only people I am around are church and they are all 50+ years old.

"I recently started a job and as I do more shifts the more self conscious I have become. Before I even talk about that I have really bad issues with my body image, I always think people are better than me and that they will be judging me. When I work my mind only let us me work with certain people, if they are too pretty then I cannot work there. Ill cry myself to sleep over how I do not fit into my job, yes Id say I am good at it but I feel like deep down inside they do not like me. I am not good at having a laugh because of the sheer amount of trauma I have been through and Ill have a panic attack when people start joking around. How do I fix these issues?

I posted this on multiple threads. I hope it can help someone.Hi!I just wanted to share a book that really helped me on my journey with depression and anxiety. I think it is a must read. I even recommended it to my therapist and she went out and bought it. it is called the mood cure by Julia Ross. It explains the physical aspects of depression and anxiety in your body. It shows you natural supplements you can take if you do not want to go down the medication route. It even has a quiz to determine what type of depression you have. Hope this helps! A book that changed my life and taught me about depression and anxiety [Tip],0

I am very fortunate to have a loving parent and s.o. in my life. To put it brief I experienced an accidental overdose a few years ago. I cannot work and recently got denied disability. I more often than not have ZERO money.Ever since my accident I have been homestuck and unable to get out. I often sleep in all day. I do things to distract myself. I would rather be dead than be too poor to do anything. These last months have felt like years and I want out. Suicidal after accident,1
"I am a gay trans man and have so many years of complex trauma, I hate my job, I feel like no one loves me or believes me or treats me like the person I am, I know feelings are not facts but I am so fucking tired of feeling like this. I have wasted my life trying to make everyone happy and I am just tired. I am so tired. I do not want to live anymore, scratch that, I do not want to live with this pain anymore. I have been gay as long as I have known even though it was something I had to push down for many years and I did not even realize being trans was something you could be but it is, after an occasional bump of not feeling like shit due to life saving shit like Spravato, I feel like my pain is back and I am just tired of having to fight back so so hard. I feel like my life is meaningless but I know it is not. I want to kill myself, not the current self but the old self and finally be the man I am supposed to be. I realize it is going to have to be some more intense trauma therapy and likely moving to actual therapeutic Ketamine but I just do not want to live like this anymore. Not die but live.

I am 22m. Been anxious af all my life. I am at a point where I honestly do not want to live as me anymore. I do not see a way out. Its bad enough to be temperamentally extremely anxious but combined with being extremely ugly and short AND now balding at 22. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with all of this. I feel intense shame about being me. Its pathetic not being able to just look your boss in the eyes and have a normal conversation. I have no chance of having a normal life like this. I honestly just want to disappear. Cease existence. I cannot walk to the fucking busstop without shaking with anxiety. I used to have dreams. I do not know man. I feel like such a bitch writing here like this. But I do not know what else to do. I cannot suicide because it would affect a lot of people around me. So I am just stuck. Endure untill death. Someone please explain to me how can I have a healthy self-image when my face is deformed and I look 50 years old while being 22. AND I cannot be normal around people due to my anxiety.

"Every so often on an askreddit thread I see a post about what men want more of and every time one of the top replies is compliments. I have never been able to relate, I do not say that to be arrogant, just to provide context and hopefully some people reading this may stop judging themselves and others based on appearances. Often through my life I have been told I should model, or complimented on my looks, which is rare as a man, but this has never translated into healthy relationships due to anxiety. I grew up with acne until I was in my early 20s and bullying left me with debilitating social anxiety. When I drank it went away but that is never a good strategy. At 25 I finally faced down a few of my demons and with the aid of liquid courage for the first time pulled a one night stand whilst travelling, when it came down to it I could not get hard. I had to jerk myself off to the point of almost finishing so when I did enter I lasted two strokes. After this I dated but felt too nervous about sex to follow up on promising dates, I remember one date with a girl that seemed a very good match, I cancelled on her hours before we were meant to meet twice because of anxiety. A couple years later I started going out and managed to pull a few more one night stands, each time the same routine, I would be hard and ready to go, then have anxiety at the point of penetration and lose my erection. Girls were put off by this and even those who had been chasing me down for second and third dates stopped messaging. This made me feel like an abject failure, I looked around at everyone around me, all able to do this fundamentally human thing, and felt isolated for not being able to follow through with the one thing that is the reason any of us are here in the first place. Since then I have gone through the cycle a few times: avoiding dating altogether -&gt; downloading the apps and sorting myself out with dates -&gt; taking a girl back to mine and going limp at the point of penetration -&gt; avoiding dating altogether -&gt; and on and on.At this point its not just the sexual inexperience but the inexperience with relationships that only further entrenches my feelings of being an outsider who will never fit in. I am now 30, my friends are marrying or having children, and I am unable to do anything more than smooth talk a girl into bed (and then fail to penetrate her). This is a deep source of shame for me, noone would guess this about me, I feel like a fraud. Some friends have told me they assume I am a fuckboy, it would be interesting to see their reactions if they found out how wrong they were but I am too deeply ashamed to share this w anyone. If I play this out to the future I am not sure what happens. When I was younger I had hope in figuring it all out, but that hope is quickly fading. I have tried cialis, I have entertained loading up on a high dose and visiting prostitutes until I am desensitised to sexual anxiety, but sometimes I feel fated to stay stuck where I am, and that makes for a very bleak outlook. If you read this far thanks, aware I am ranting now. Erectile dysfunction and alienation is ending me",1

"This might seem a little selfish, but I think what I did today was a good thing at least for meblocking my friend(s) was the best decision I have made in awhile. Ask me tomorrow or in a week if this statement still holds because it may not. But the last time I did it I was really happy and things were good for me. I think the universe has a way of punishing you when you make a decision/decisions that is bad or could end poorly for youand rewards you when you make a decision that aligns with what is best. All of these depressive mood swings and anxiety still very much exists, so it is still essential not to isolate myself, but I should not surround myself with people who because me such great negativity. I like to trust my gut and say that those people were just as bad for me as I was for them. Maybe even more to be quite frank. I trust my gut :/ and so far I have not been punished. Smells bad, it probably is bad. Feels bad, it is bad. that is kind of the philosophy I go by when dealing with the people in my life. I kind of have to ask myself this question, am I doing it for myself? Or am I doing it for my friend(s)? Never would I give anyone such stupid advice so why would i be dumb enough to follow through. Even through all of this I had a goal that only involved myself. And I did not let it convince me to self-sabotage. So it was a win for me anyways, I just had to make the decision to be self-less or selfish. P.s. I started sketching again I kind of forgot how much i love it and how fucking killer I am at it.

People after someone has killed himself say that he was a selfish guy .. he just thought about himself .. he did not even think how His parents will feel after he has gone .. how his friends family members will feel The problem is that they do not understand the mental state of him .. He is such neglected and isolated from his real life .. so much problems in daily life daily fights with parents about his career his studies that in his subconscious he starts thinks no one gives a fuck about him .. nobody cares Whether he is here or not .. even if he is gone there will be no one remembering .. because when he is alive there is no one who is with him .. so he just feels that I should go.. And that leads to a sucide. THE REASON WHY THEY SUICIDE,0
"So I missed a dosage of my medicine on accident recently, and it got me thinking and I realising something.I will literally never be what is defined as a 'normal' person. I will always be labelled as someone with mental illness, whether I like it or not. My mother at a recent funeral called me the 'different' 'quiet', and I am pretty sure she even said the 'strange' one. And it did not hit me until now how harsh that was.Now, my mother is not mean to me by any means, but that just kind of sucks to hear. I am tired of being basically called subhuman by people. I cannot help how I act or appear to other people. I am mentally aware I am different. But it does not need to be said outloud. I already know.This sucks. Majorly. I mean, there is nothing I can do about it. I will always be like this for pretty much my lifetime and I am questioning if it is even worth it or not. it is already really hard and exhausting and this is only the start.What am I even supposed to do? or live for at this point? My brain is fucked beyond repair. There is not a ""it gets better"" for me.This is how it will always be for me. And this sucks because I have always wanted a significant other, but I most likely will not be able to find her anymore because it is very hard to be a partner with someone like me.Anyways, going to post this excerpt here for now and maybe write a bit more onto my website.If I even make it until 2022, it will be major achievement. because Idk wtf I am doing. Just realised I will never be 'normal'",1
"I really want to get help. I want to confide in someone, but I am too hung up on the thought that they would take on my issues as well. I have always had the mindset that issues are personal; something that you deal with alone. You could tell me that is not true, but I just subconsciously act fake in front of people. I mask my feelings without even noticing that I am doing it. My last therapist did not work for me because I was not even being real with her. I would keep smiling and I would get extremely uncomfortable when opening up, so I would barely say anything about myself or my problems. I only realize this looking back on it now. Hell, we even talked about the weather for a whole session once. I know that its horrible but I do not know how to stop. After a recent breakdown, I realized that I do this with everyone I know. Even with my closest friends and family. So I am basically isolating myself without even trying. How fucking crazy is that? Depression is weird, man. Stuck",0

And I tell my patients to do things to relax, help them structure their days with breaks and activities they like. While not having time for a lunch break myself, while finishing reports on the weekends... we have this depression questionnaire we make patients fill out every week and I scored about average of my patients - moderate to severe depression. it is so fucking funny sometimes.

"Throwaway, my wife knows my main. I went to a lawyer last week to get an idea of what divorce is going to look like for me and my kids. She cheated, I tried to move past it but I can not.

"To all of the people who feel like their health is declining , please do not google your symptoms. I have been dealing with ilness anxiety for years now and everytime I would get anxious that something is wrong with me I would google it. This lead to many sleepless nights because google told me I most likley have some serious health condition. Please if you feel like something is wrong just forget google is there and go to the doctor. The bullshit written on google can seriously worsen your mental health and lead to severe depression. that is what happend to me. I was already depressed but the last month was probably the worst time of my life and it all started over using google for symptoms. I had just read an article about different types of cancer and what symptoms to look out when I realised something was not right (kind of private so will not go in detail) . Long story short after searching google for hours I came to the conclusion that I am experiencing a common cancer symptom. So I instantly call my doctor but he was not available so I had to wait 2 weeks for him to be available and than some for the test results to come out. During this almost 1 month of waiting I completely destroyed my already weak mental. I was constantly imagining scenarios in my head where I get diagnosed with cancer or some other dangerous condition. I could not sleep or do anyting other than sit in my bed and worry. More symptoms kept appearing and my health kept worsening. I seriously considered suicide as my life was not that good already and being diagnosed with something horrible would have been the nail in the coffin. My results came back and it turned out that it was not anything serious, most of the symptoms I was experiencing were stress based and I had tortured myself for nothing. I am not saying that you should not care if something is wrong with you, but please do not jump to conclusions based on google articles. If you are anxious about your health , please please do not use google! (advice)",0
"I am M/nearly 22 (because I am born December 1999) (also I am ashamed of my depression because it is unmanly)0 I have been living with depression since 2012 where it got worse every year until 2015 where I had multiple failed suicide attempts (not really manly, I know). After that it now comes in episodes. Sometimes these episodes are extreme (like right now because I have lost a family, people on tumblr spread false information about me, witch hunt me, I am all alone and I am getting doxxed), medium or mild. Also there is my dysphoria and paranoia mixed up in this as well. Before I tell you my whole life story I keep it short: Yes, I have been to a psychologist but it is not possible due to Covid at the moment. And I never had any friends in my life as people rather liked to bully me and physically hurt me (that is why I am glad I am out of school for so many years now) and almost got me killed once by throwing me in front of a bus. Anyways I noticed that my eyesight got worse and worse over the years. Can it be because of depression or because I stay up all night (I am very nocturnal) for years now? I had a sharp crisp eyesight a few years ago where I couldf see details 10m away but now I cannot even Identify faces anymore from one meters. (sorry for using the metric system, I am not american) I am scared to go blind. Additonal Note: My hearing is actually my greatest strenght and the only sense left that is close to superhuman as proven by multiple tests in the past that I took. (I do not like to mention it because it is considered cringe and unnormal and I am very ashamed of it but the hearing thing might be because of my autism.) Can depression worsen your eyesight?",0
"I have so much to live for. I have kind of supportive parents, a comfortable life and a bright future ahead (at least a career that will make me enough money to survive). Yet I feel so sad and down. I feel like I have no motivations or goals and I do not enjoy doing anything. I am constantly worrying about my future even though I feel like I will not be living long enough to see my future anyway. I use all my time to study instead of pursuing my hobbies because I am afraid that I will not be able to pass my professional certification exam.Even when I was in my happiest relationship, I felt so alone at times and no friendship gave me any satisfaction. I just feel these bouts of sadness and I feel guilty for even feeling upset because I live such a blessed and fortunate life. Why am I depressed? What can I do to improve my mood? I feel so stuck and hopeless, and all alone even though I do not want anybody around me. Please give me any suggestions.. I do not understand why I am depressed.",0

I feel like I was fucked and was just born to suffer. I wish I could just snap out of this mentality, but years of feeling like an ugly pos has made me this way. I have tried working out and therapy, but none of this shit is working. Too ugly for any woman to fall in love with me",0

"my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speaking(texting) to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big, strong, charismatic, athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5y/o he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby :( so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel, but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post, triggering convo w/ brother",0
I tried it a few times but it never worked except for the last time but I got scared and called the ambulance.

"I am sorry to make you feel bad but i am overwhelmed and probably will end my life .let us talk about me: i am an 18y/o guy who is depressed and anxious since the age of 14 when i started noticing i was around quite nobody.I always had few friends but in the last 4 years things get worse. I do not know if its adolescence or something like that , but I am aware that i am worthless and nobody likes me (even my brother) . my only luck is that i always had pets and luckily i have a strong bond with them because i am a very sensitive and sweet person , maybe is for this reason that i always had problems with my peers at school . Since October 2020 i put myself a goal : getting a girlfriend within december 2021 . So during this period of time i tried hard getting a girlfriend fighting my shyness , but i keep getting rejections and fails, and this for my already low self-esteem is enough . Also be alone without my will is hard to accept. So i arrived at the conclusion that it is not worth keep living in this way and want to commit suicide but i cannot because my mom would get for sure ptsd that will end up with her suicide.So i am asking for your help because i think you are my last resort . Therapy is not working and also taking sertraline is useless to me , i count on you I need your help",0

"Basically, the title. Whenever my friends are going through a tough time I am able to encourage them and help them get back on their feet, but when it comes time to take my own advice and encouragement (which is pretty much always, I have had chronic depression for over ten years now) I fail to. I always end up doing g the same things, hiding away in my room, staying up for days on end, never eating, and despite knowing that this just makes it worse, I continue to do so. It feels like an inescapable cycle of melancholy that eternally shreds my desire to live. I am just in cycles of existential despair and total apathy for my future. I can encourage others but not myself",0
Since I am pretty depressed and start to feel less and less emotion (which is quite scary) i just want to feel my heart again or feel alive or feel joy or at least anything.

"Once upon a time there were a happy male. Needless to say there is nothing left of him anymore. I can barely remember the last 4 year of my life. At all. Some few memories though. I can barely remember the last 4 year of my life. At all. Some few memories though. I have been in an abusive relationship for the past 6 years. 6 months ago I broke free. It was hard. However the reason I managed to actually break free were due to the fact that I got into drugs. About 4 years ago I started to isolate myself from my friends. I did not even recognise it myself. I thought it were because I had a lot of things going on in my life but today I see the pattern. My abusive ex wanted that to happen. Roughly 3 years ago we moved in together and that is when the abuse skyrocketed. Both physical and mental abuse. Almost daily. I lost all my friends. Lost my family. Everything. Not that my family and I actually had a good relation before but if it were ok then, it absolutely went to the bottom. The only person I have had any contact with at all the last 3 years is in fact my abusive ex. it is sick. I know. However I did not really realize how bad it was while I were in all the constant drama, I think my brain were too busy to defend myself from all the physical/mental abuse. Fight/flight mode all the time. that is where the drugs really helped me out. Once I got down from that I could clearly see how sick my situation were. Finally roughly 6 months ago I broke free. Needless to say it is been hell. I do believe I suffer from some sort of PTSD now and it is literally killing me slowly. So much so that I am done. I am ending it today. I can barely socialise at all due to this. My brain will not allow me to relax in any situation regarding another human being. Hyper-vigilant all the time. Completely emotional numb. People even make fun of me calling me Mr.Robot. I tried to seek help, but were sent off. I tried to seek help from friends, no-one reaches out. I tried to seek help from family, no-one cares. I guess they are doing right. Their lives will continue just like normal in a matter of time. Think I will do it today..",1

I could not break out of that rut.I am not even really sure what changed today. Maybe it was anger. Maybe it was accepting that I hated how my life was at the moment and I was done staying in place day in and day out.But I wanted to share an encouraging story. Sending you all strength. I hope you find the strength to make it through another day and get even the smallest task done.If you do, make sure you give yourself a good pay on the back. Proud of you for getting out of bed.

"Where exactly is the line between being able to talk to your therapist about suicidal thoughts without being committed? (I live in Florida, so we call it getting Baker acted here.) Will she only do it if I say I want to kill myself or actually threaten to do it? Or is it up to her discretion, like if I just talk about having the thoughts she could potentially get me committed? I am in a bad place but I am too lame to actually kill myself and a psych hold would make my situation worse. I do not have anyone else I can talk to about these feelings and I just need to know what I can and cannot talk to my therapist about. Thanks guys.

"So I have decided to do something pretty reckless, but something that I feel I need to do. I am going to go and stand somewhere high, somewhere that I can throw myself off of and kill myself if I want too. Then I am going to ask myself whether I truly want to live. Because right now I am in limbo everyday what it is I want to do. Do I want to kill myself? Or am I just sick of struggling and if I give it my all maybe it will be worth it. I have a feeling I want to fight, but then everyday I get up I do not do anything. So I think if I said to myself, ""Either from this point forward you fight with everything you have or you might as well jump"" it would help.I have lost everything I fought for, absolutely everything. This is the first time ever I am asking myself honestly, do you want to be alive? Like I fought so hard to make my mum proud, then I met my gf and I did absolutely everything I could to be worthy of her love. We had a miscarriage and from that point onwards my life has been hell. I then lost my mum which killed me, then after being stuck abroad thanks to covid I missed her funeral.. for me to get back and all my possessions are gone. Then my gf leaves me. So genuinely I have no reason to fight, only for a future that is not even a promise. I know who I want to be, but it is whether I have the fight and energy left to make it. Which is why I need to do what I said. Because if I stand on that bridge and ask myself ""Have I got the fight in me left"", if the answer I come back with is ""no"" I will jump. Next Week, I Might Do It",1

"A little background: I finally found a seasonal job serving a few years back that granted me the most financial security I would ever had. I paid off my debts. I bought a new car. I was planning to save up for a house. I thought I was a good server. I was personable with the guests, always on time, rarely called in, and wanted to work nights. I thought I was valued.Then covid hit and we shut down like everyone else. When things reopened, we had reduced our seating in half, so they did not bring back all the servers yet. The season came and went. I ended up working for a friend at her local business for the rest of the summer and made ends meet through Uber in the winter.As the next season came around, my job brought back all the remaining servers... Except four. Obviously, I was one of them.I called my lead and she explained that she ""could not"" tell me WHY I was not picked to come back. She said I was one of her favorites because I was reliable and worked evenings. Then, as the season got into full swing, there was talk of adding more seats. And then they put up applications for new servers. Some co-workers suggested I reapply, but my thought was, ""they have still got four of us on furlough, they can call us.""They never did. ..Now, I am just bitter. My best friend just posted pictures from her 5-year Pinning Ceremony and I want to be happy for her... But my 5-years should have been in 2020. I was denied what I saw as a career, or at least a means to reach some long-term financial goals. I loved my job. I loved my co-workers. We were a family. And then someone in management decided my future for me. For reasons I never got to know. And now I struggle to tell my best friend ""congratulations,"" when I really feel bitterness instead. And that makes me feel like a horrible person. I just my job and the security of my future thanks to covid. I am struggling with grief, bitterness, and depression and I do not know how to let it go.",0

"I am new to this sub, first time posting. I do not think anyone really wants to read 50 paragraphs about my life. I wanted to make it as simple as I could for anyone that is feeling empathetic today:) Edit- its in fact 50 paragraphs I am a female entering my mid twenties now and I feel like a mess but somehow put together. A well put together mess if you willIm going to she would some light on my past as briefly as I canPTSD as a child from witnessing medical problems with my father (lots of blood etc) and also diagnosed anxiety disorder- medicated for anxiety. Abused drugs all throughout my teen years, landed in rehab due to 3 cocaine overdoses by the age of 17- diagnosed anxiety and depression-developed panic disorder in rehab-medicated for anxiety. Zero meds after rehab as they did not help me at all. In my mid 20s now and loosely diagnosed with ADD- medicated with a stimulant- has never been abused and it has helped a ton. My dad died two years ago. No we were not close but it haunts me daily and I have outbursts where Ill cry alone in my car or when I am alone in my apartment. I live with my boyfriend. I guess I am just trying to find some comfort. I feel like there is no fixing me. I am so young and so much has happened. Nothing works. I feel like my ADD diagnosis is not correct at all yet that is the one medication that is worked. I have had an eating disorder my entire life and abused cocaine so I understand doctors not looking at this as being the issue or trying treatment for it. Aside from that my life is GOOD. I am financially stable, I have a loving boyfriend, and a dog. I pay my own bills etc. Why do I constantly feel like hell? I am either angry or I want to cry. For no reason at all.I cannot hold a job for the life of me unless its bartending because I get to drink. (No I do not abuse alcohol I have 1-2 drinks a night which is a lot for some I understand) I have a customer service/insurance broker type job with hours of 11-5 daily and even that is too much for me to handle. Granted people are screaming at me constantly. I am not sure if this is my depression or if I am just a terrible ungrateful human. I find beauty in things in life. I just feel terrible often.

"There is already such a large shift in emptiness, meaningless and depression now that we strive further and further from our biological instincts and goals. And it will only get worse with the constant races to create new larger than life technology. No matter how much technology we replace ourselves with there are still going to be repressed unfulfilled biological needs, until we replace our neurons with nanobots, digitally upload our brains and leave humanity as a thing of the past. I do not see how anyone desires it but from what I have seen transhumanists are becoming about as popular as anti-industrialists. Its so surreal to me because everything they describe as a dream sounds like a complete nightmare to me - how they long to leave the violent, dirty, senselessness of humanity behind for a clean, robotically perfect utopia. I genuinely want to kms when i think of living in such a world. All the passions and struggles of humanity gone. Not like it would ever happen, because clearly any utopia is impossible until we cure greed from the human mind. And looking at the world right now, the race for this tech can only result in a dystopia. We will dig ourselves deeper and deeper into mass depression, inescapable surveillance and alienation. I do not understand, we all know how depressed we get surrounded by tech for hours on end, we all know the detachment it causes, but we do jack shit about changing anything. Every time some useless little technology comes out everyone rolls their eyes and then buys it, like with alexa especially. Why? Peer pressure? General lack of resistance? I do not get it. The only way to stop moneyhoarding technocrats is to stop buying shit you do not need, and because the sales to plummet. I know sure as hell when literal mindchips come out everyone will protest at first and then buy it. I fuckn hope not tho. I just wanted to experience humanity and I have barely even had a chance to do it. that is all I have ever wanted. I fucking hate it. The idea that humanity is something dirty and aggressive to be left in the past for godly perfection infuriates me.

"Work makes me feel like I am a slave trapped inside of a box. I have to put myself and soul into a prison cell for 8 hours while I apathetically get through the shift. How is this not suicidal? What part about that is fun? Its modern day feudalism at its finest. Jobs do not promote any individual growth. They just want you to willing to work 190 hours a week and do not give a fuck about mental health. They care zero. Instead you will be ostracized and scrutinized because you do not engage in the toxic one up culture every job has. It enslaves me and makes me feel uncomprehendingly trapped. There is a whole world out there and inside of me but I have to stand at this shithole for 8 hours? Id rather be dead. Who would not? Are you kidding me? The dread is unmatched. The dread is terrorizing and most people do not understand. They just tell me that is life. Some life we live. that is just such a joke to me. I have not even mentioned the miserable system. Its not just my job I hate. (I do hate it) but its working in general. The whole concept. People call me lazy but that is because they are brainwashed into believing selling your soul is the best way to live. Minimum wage jobs are so toxic. The management has zero regard for humanity, the employee morale is pathetically low, i do not give a fuck about the customers and they do not give a fuck about me. No one wants to be there. Then, you have to obtain experience to get a less shitty job and that whole process is miserable to. I wish I lived in a European or different culture where mental health and family relationships are more a priority then punching in hours on the clock.

"my girlfriend has always had some form of anxiety and depressive episodes. she hates the way she looks and refuses to leave the house due to public/ other people just give her panic attacks etc so I am also unable to see her. she also refuses to tell anyone as she sees herself as a burden, a waste of time and thinks it is embarrassing. I love her n want the best for her so I know she needs help but it is hard to get it her when she somewhat refuses. I do not know what she suffers from its clearly a form of anxiety I assume but what else does this sound like and any solutions to any of these problems are welcomed my girl is not okay",0
"Neither does my dad. I live with him. I think we both have npd. I do not drink any water. Neither does my dad. His teeth are coming out. He only has maybe ten teeth and he is 65. I do not talk to anyone in my apartment. I do not work. I am not allowed. I am always sabotaged. I am also sabotaged from eating, from sleeping, from drinking water and from going to use the rest room. I was traumatized like this since I was an infant. Since my Dad is a scientologist I am basically not allowed to breathe or exist. I just want to say some things, but they are very hellish. I cannot get a therapist. I am not able to advocate for myself. I have gone to the suicide hotline before. I have gone into suicide hospitals three times. I am diagnosed with schizoaffective borderline ptsd psychosis anxiety depression!!!!!!!!!! Dude I am fucking dying. I would really rather eat than be like this. This sucks. I am not allowed to pee, I have to go right now. I live with my mom and dad. I am 26 years old with cptsd. I did research on it. I do not get it I live in a town with food I am hungry I do not understand why I am not allowed to eat. I do not pee, I do not eat and I do not sleep",1
"I really just want to kill myself now but I do not know how, I do not have medication, I do not have a weapon, I do not want to slit my wrists and die in pain. I would leave the gas on but I live with my family and that would kill them too. I do not have anyone, my family does not give a fuck about me, I have no friends, the only being that likes me is my cat. My therapist told me that I need to see psychiatrist but I do not want to solve this, I do not want to keep trying, I have been like this for years and I am just tired of everything. I just want to do kill myself right now but I cannot",1
"Anyone else find that they cannot really feel too many positive emotions, and instead feel irritable towards new partner? I am trying to be able to discern whether or not I am just not into this person or if it is the depression speaking. it is not a constant irritability. For context I have been single for around 3.5 years, love alone time and this whole thing is an adjustment for me. it is been a couple months and I do not feel love. I feel kind of flat. Or otherwise irritated. Dating while depressed",0
"I just want to die but I cannot. I know the family I do care about would be shattered so I cannot. I have been telling myself for years that I would stay alive at least for my nephew but fuck I am not good enough to take care of myself. Everyday I think ""Fuck what am I going on for?"" I wake up everyday to go to a job I hate with terrible coworkers and management just to drink or smoke my days off away to avoid the negative feelings. I have gotten to the point where nothing can numb how disatrisfied I am in myself and my circumstances.. When I apply myself to do more I just lose and lose. Been trying to get a new job or skill for awhile but Covid is slowing down opportunities good enough to pay the bills. I get teased and get to 2nd or 3rd interviews just to be told no. Happened 6 times this month and I am just like why am I even trying to improve.it is hard to motivate yourself when you believe you are garbage, that you do not deserve to be content with life. I have lost joy in doing almost everything I used to. I do not read as much as I used to/should, I do not find games fun anymore, stopped hitting the gym from the lack of passion, I do not go out much due to the lack of money. Even eating food has lost most of the joy it should normally bring a person. Nothing ever seems worth the effort and when I try again and again I do not get results. I know I should not just give up but at the same time when you are waking up everyday to suicidal thoughts and going to bed with them for years.. I just want everything to end already. Burden",0
"Fucking ha. ""Just get treatment""",1
"I have been on meds since 3 months ago and feeling a bit better (I guess). No longer feel excruciatingly sad, or have irrational fear/anxiety at night, but I cannot still live a good life. My brain refuses to work, keeps wanting instant reward, and I have no control over it. I am too ashamed to meet my psychologist because I never make progress. I have been seeing her for a year, getting all her advices and tips, trying to do what she said and but never make it consistent. At this point, everything does not matter anymore, although I know damn well Ill regret it and beat myself for the failure I cancel my appointment with my psychologist",0
"At the beginning, I have not seen professionalist yet. I tried once the school psychologist, but she did not want to listen about my worries that I have depression. She helped me with my father and I do not listen that buying a bottle of water for me is not worth and it is too expensive anymore, so she at least helped me in some sphere.I have been simping girls since I was 6. I have not been in serious relationship and I have not had sex so far. Since I remember I used to have 1 friend, no more than just 1, who was often changing. When I turned 14, it was more difficult to me, so I kept looking desperately for anybody. At this moment, I have one friend who ""survived"" with me surprisingly long, because more than a year is a shock! For 5 years I can count on 1 hand amount of people with who I talk regularly even on chat. I do not go out more often than twice a month with this one friend, because I have no one else to see. It makes me lonely, and it made me addicted to ma******te. I resigned from all kinds of parties, because whenever I try to go for it, it is a disaster! School parties, parties in houses or in clubs, birthdays or anything else, it is always worse than i can even imagine. Last time I ran out crying to my car and I was sitting in there for 30 minutes after 20 min preparing for coming back there from the same car. I was scared and tired, I was so stressed that I vomit immediately everything I tried to eat, so I just drank water. I also completely resigned from drinking alcohol, in 2021 I am 100% clear. Since my 18th birthday (January 2020) I drank max. 10 beers up to August 2020. I used to be stood over by a lot of people on different levels of my education by age-mates. I was called ""fa**ot"", even by my father. I would like to mention here that I always was straight. I keep social distanced, because I cannot deal with people. I am boring and cannot make anybody feel safe because I am weak physically and emotionally. I am lanky but useless. I have good grades, but I am stupid.I am retarded on relationships sphere, but I am not dangerous or aggressive. I am werid and panic a lot. I want to cry in situations when there are a lot of people around me, like in theater. Because of that I would love to move to introvertial Japan, but I will come back to that later. I do not have any useful knowledge or skills that would let me become independent, so I am also addicted to my parents' will. I do everything so slowly and I do not have any power to live. I sleep 10 hours per day, then I go to my seasonal job, come back home, have 3h to waste and go to sleep again, it has some charm that I like. Tomorrow I am getting results from exams I was writting at the end of high school, which will tell me if I have any chances to go to university, but I do not have big hopes. I would like to be journalist or therapist, but I cannot deal with myself, so where is dealing with other people?I live with my parents and grandparents at the same time in the same flat. They are all far religious, so I do not have a choice when it comes to religion. I have to go to church once a week or I will get punished by for example more practicing and praying. They used to breed me together because my parents work a lot so my grandparents were substituting them. I deal with 2 different types of breeding and I must satisfy them all by being nice and kind and do everything they expect and want from me. I am agnostic, but I must pretend I am religious too. When I told honestly my father that I do not pray regularly at home, he treated me like air for 3 weeks - did not talk to me, ignored me etc.they are pragmatic and conservative so I sometimes treat them like they are dumber than me but they have 1 thing I am jealous of - will to live. I would love to sleep forever, because I do not want to take responsibility for my life. I would probably be already dead if I was not so scared of death, thanks to their influence. I do not have anybody who could help me with my hell, which I probably made for my own wish. I do not have power to live, people around me do not see life in me, I am pessimistic and cannot find any good feature in me. I am worthless and I get what I deserve.I find pleasure in fanaticism and obsession. Firstly it were cartoons, then anime, now whole Japan. I am obsessed with it, I would love to move there but I know that I am blind and I do not see disadvantages. I have the feeling like only there I can achieve my biggest dream - happiness. I would probably reject every couple offer from local women because I only find Asian girls attractive. I am more interested in their culture, art, nature, music and more than my local. Maybe I consider it as paradise because it is so far from my actual place of living, my family and more. Sometimes I feel it is achievable, but usually I treat it as dream which is impossible to achieve. I am so separated, but I do not feel any privacy out of my phone because of my brother with who I share my room, and we always get the same things. I feel like I were completely average, Grey person, but under tameness.The worst thing is that I got used to everything of that - not having girlfriend and friends, being addicted and obedient to my family, being weak, dumb and childish, to being ugly and scared of everything. I do not want to change because it is out of my control, I do not want it and probably I would not even have enough power to that. I know s*it and I do not know why I write this. One of my foreign mates from India told me to do that few times this year so I finally did that, but I already consider my life as lost. It all comes to time when I finally die but I do not even know if after death it will be better.I love watching scars, ravens, blood (especially blooding wounds and eyes) and I tried to write a novel in my native language. I did it and published it so I know I left anything on this world but it will not succeed. I am completely apathic and lazy, and probably any help would not let me live normally now, it is already too bad. it is all my fault and I know about it. Stuff like ""everything's going to be OK"" or ""you need to take care of yourself and keep fighting"" do not work on me - it is done. Any speciallist have not told me that I have depression, because I have not visited any forever and I will not do it soon, because I do not have enough money.Thank you for listening to me, I do not expect anything else from you now. I do not have hope, will or power to change my life, so it just depends on time when I will be brave enough to start doing something... to end this. My best friends are funko pops of my favorite band... really, it is comedy, not tragedy.I wish everyone all the best every time because I know how bad can life be and I do not wish it to anybody so please guys, if you are not that down yet, try!Greetings,B! (my name is to hard to spell &lt;3) The most depressing case of undiscovered depression",0

"I had an appendicectomy a month or so ago and while I was under the anaesthetic it was complete nothingness and it was the most peaceful, calm moment of my life, I want to go back to that.

"I have struggled with depression for about a year and a half, ever since the pandemic happened. I started feeling bad when life denied travel, friends, socialization, even exercise (to a point). Now, since I am vaccinated and places have been opening up, I have gotten to travel and see my friends again, but it is not really the same. Life just feels like a dark hallway, but with a black hole chasing you around, as well as pitfalls a mile deep that are covered in wet algae on the smooth walls. Not to mention, the farther you run down the hallway, the darker it gets. Basically, life sucks.My mom constantly tells me ""it will get better, I swear"" and I would love to believe her, but unfortunately, after experiencing near-constant stress and sadness, I have been less and less able to cling onto that hope and more and more kill myself. Everybody says what a great person I am, and I genuinely appreciate their compliments, but I am not sure how I am supposed to stay alive when there is the prospect of eternal happiness and life is a hellhole.Also, I am in Boy Scouts, and I am going to summer camp in a couple of days. Now, BSA does a cool little thing called the swim test, which you have to pass if you want to participate in certain merit badges. This is what is been causing me LOTS of anxiety over the past week. I am trying to swim a little bit, so I can get used to the water before I have to take the test, but I am still pretty anxious about the test.Essentially, life has kind of been stretching me very thin, and I am not sure I can take it anymore. Thanks for reading, have a cookie . Depression (and recently, anxiety), have been making life very hard to live",1
"I thought I can make it,i thought I can live but I was just lying to myself.I cannot leave the place that gave me suffering and pain.My anxiety is so bad that I feel like I am dying,my entire body gets numb,I cannot breath and my stomach hurts like somebody is stabbing me.For now the only thing keeping me alive is my dog,so when he dies I am going to do it.I know my family will be devastated but I cannot do this anymore,I am not happy all I ever feel is pain and how small and useless I am.I know nobody will understand,but I tried getting help,I am taking antidepressants and going on sessions but it never makes a difference.If there is God know that I am sorry for these words and my actions,I love you but I cannot do this anymore I am in pain and it is getting worse every day but a big part of me wishes you are not real,that there is nothing left after death,no consensus no existence no awerness.If anyone reads this you do not have to replay I just wanted this out of my sistem My anxiety cannot be cured",1

"All I want to do is lie in bed and sleep all day. I had a panic attack from sensory overload when I went grocery shopping and felt the most pathetic I have ever been. Everything overwhelms me, especially emotions. I do not want to get up and go outside or face the real world, I am so anxious every time I talk to people that Ill somehow upset them or drive them away that I get even more exhausted. I feel really bad because I have not talked to my best friend in a while. Every time I sit down to talk with them on call and hang out I get so tired that I can barely stay awake most days and I am afraid I am driving them away or they think I am losing interest in them. Worrying about everything is so taxing and I am tired all the time. I just want to rest. Existing is so exhausting",0
"!!VENTING NOT ASKING FOR HELP!!For the past couple of months, ever since I quit my job after having multiple crippling panic attacks at work, I have been finding it hard to leave the house. it is gotten to a point where I just do not go outside anymore and hide away in fantasies my brain makes, waiting to die. Before I tried getting jobs but I cannot hold any down and eventually just stopped trying. For the last 3 months I have been forced to see a therapist, the drive there makes me physically ill and paranoid. I still have a hard time expressing to her how I feel in person but I cannot stop seeing her. She has ordered me to go to a doctor twice but I just cannot go.I have a very loving family but they are too loving and not in the ways that I need, I have no autonomy or word in decisions made for me. I no longer have the will to argue. I cannot see a future for myself, I had plans on moving out before I quit my job, but now it is just a cold dream. These feelings are taboo in my family but my parents have been very patient with me until now. I think my mom just kicked me out. I have until Monday to pack to my things she said, I am not upset or sad by this, it is what I deserve. Not to sound like I am in my own self pity party but I was told that even if I am in such a ""dark place"" I still chose to be in the situation that I am in, and really I cannot help but agree. How is it that others can still live their day to day lives but I cannot, I cannot comprehend it.Anyways I think I am going to homeless but I cannot find the will to do anything about it. disappointed in myself",0

"My mother forced my brother and I to take care of our grandmother, who is in the early-to-mid stages of dementia. She cries all the time, never knows where she is and has to constantly be reminded that she is not doing anything wrong and that she is fine.I work from home and cannot escape. From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, I am borderline panicking over the fact that she might have a fit or an episode. I love my grandmother so much and it hurts to see her like this and not be able to help her.I cannot sleep because I am worried she will wake up in the middle of the night in hysterics. I cannot shower because I am worried she will call out to me and I will not hear it and she will spiral. Fuck, I cannot even go to the bathroom for the same reason. Every waking moment I am subjected to planning my life around her and her illness.I never asked for this. I never once said that I was okay with being her caregiver. Hell, I never once said that I was even okay with being alive. I do not have children for a reason. How can I properly care for someone else if I cannot properly care for myself?All while my mother, grandma's daughter, is off playing house with her new boyfriend, talking about the kitchen she is going to renovate and coming over at most three days a week for an hour at a time.I wish she would actually contribute and take care of her mother instead of burdening my brother and I with this.My father sees me suffer. My brother sees me suffer. My S/O sees me suffer. I see them looking at me, wanting to help but knowing that my mother cannot take criticism and will come up with an excuse to not take anyone's suggestions as to how to help.I do not want to die. I just do not want to feel like this anymore. I am a reluctant caregiver and I just want to relax",1
The only thing holding me back is my family. It would ruin them and they love me so much. I still cannot shake this feeling that i have an absolutely hopeless future and i do not want to live anymore. I am 25 and just finished my masters and cannot even bring myself to look for a job. Feel like I have no friends left and i cannot move out yet for financial reasons but also when I am left alone with my thoughts i get so miserable to the point where I am worried about what Ill do. I have hinted at these feelings to the only person i really consider a friend in a hope hell talk it through with me but that went nowhere. I know if i tell my mom she will be devastated and i do not really know where to go from here. do not even know what I am looking for here - i just kind of like not feeling like a freak for having these thoughts. No hope for the future and want to die so bad,1
I am 16 (m) and I do not know whether or not its Pocd or not I think it might be the real deal. I was lying in bed today on YouTube when I came across a video of a girl doing some sort of dumb challenge. She was about 7 and I got a groinal response from the thumbnail. I clicked on the video to see if I was actually aroused by her. I did not think it was real arousal until I stood up and saw that my penis was half hard not a full erection though. I felt so worried about this and started doing more testing to test my attraction. I watched videos on YouTube of young kids in swimsuits to test my penis response to it. I did not get an erection and it actually got smaller so I was feeling relieved then when I put my pants back up they prushed off the top of my penis and i thought it felt good. I got even more anxious and that maybe I am actually attracted to kids but the anxiety I am feeling is stopping me from getting an erection. The thing I mentioned earlier would suggest so. After that I decided to test my attraction to adults so I went on the hub and got fully hard pretty quickly. I think this could have been a compulsion of mine to test my attraction to adults. I was just about to start beating when an intrusive thought popped into my head of a naked child. I felt like some pulse of blood to my dick and it freaked me the fuck out. I finished to a big breasted Woman but immediately felt like shit. I cannot stop thinking that the reason I fapped is because of the intrusive thought and I cannot tell if I liked it or not. Honestly I feel like a piece of shit and this is just venting really. I plan on getting wasted tonight before ending it. I cannot live with the idea of me being turned on by little girls i fucking hate myself I am crying rn I want to end it but I do not want people to blame themselves at the same time. If you read this thanks I appreciate it have a good life and all. I think my Pocd is real and I am attempting tonight,1
I feel like sometimes it would be easier to just end it. And not have to worry about anything. Sad,0
"I do not know what to do anymore. I have reached out to so many resources and I have even admitted myself to try to get the help I need. Being there made me worse, they were not offering any therapy, just meds. I felt crazier being locked up. And now that I am out with these resources that do not actually help, I am scared. I know I will not make it by myself, but none of the resources I have gotten have been able to genuinely help me. It feels like I am just here to feed into the mental health money hole. I do not feel like anyone takes me seriously..I keep fighting back the desire to kill myself but it always comes back. And when it does its when I have no hope for any help. I am really scared that I am going to finally do it one day.. Stuck",1
"I thought today would be different. I woke up early for a change, went for some sprints in the park, sorted out some Centrelink issues (Australian government thing) and helped my dad build a vine fence for his garden. I asked my dad for a short break to do do some tasks, like buy a new mobile plan, and the above Centrelink thing. When I came back down he scolded me saying that i should have left my tasks for night, and how shitty of a worker I would be when I actual started working, ditching tasks halfway. I guess he wanted me to stick with him and finish his project, spending my whole day. And here I am again, feeling like shit again because of my father's disapproval. I cannot even talk back because he is got anger issues and goes full retard when I trigger him (he smashes plates). He never spent any time with me and only scolded me since childhood, and he expects me to want to spend my whole day helping his project. Fk me dead. I thought today would be different",0

"I was going to commit suicide a few weeks ago, but something in my mind told me not to before I got home. My parents and my brother know that I have suicidal thoughts, but it feels like they do not care. They think it is because of some bullshit that happened between me and some girl. it is partly that, but it is the fact that I just do not feel wanted. What happened made me think - ""Who the fuck is going to want me in their lives when people know about it?"" (context in the second paragraph) I was trying to find this answer for so fucking long. It finally clicks. I just cannot work up the courage to tell anyone but the counsellor I cannot even go fucking see because of lockdown. (context) there is this toxic bitch in my class who - in the past - I have vented about. She claims it is this constant re-occurrence of me venting and her finding out, etc. One ""fine"" morning, I was talking to my friend and the topic of this girl had come up. The girl (we will call her Lila) and I were not on good terms, as I commented on her behaviour - I said she was a ""piss baby"" - around 3 weeks before said morning. She said that they were dating and that she had felt bad because she did not want to reject her. I thought that because she told me this, I could say what I want. I said that she was toxic. that is it. Cut to literally 20 minutes later, I am facing her. I have apologised, she is apologised. I have never felt so relieved. It was a dick move of me to say that she was toxic but I did not think I was going to apologise. we are talking again and after lunch, during the third period, she comes up to me and tells me that I should not apologise if I was not being serious about it. She walked away, saying that what I did was low. I knew that the girl I talked to told her, but it was my fault for trusting her. I told this to my counsellor and in turn she told my parents, but I feel like that' is not the right answer (maybe not the wrong answer but not the full answer). &amp;#x200B;Essentially, I am lonely as fuck. I think my last days are coming up. I deserve to be unwanted. Deserve to be unloved. I do not feel wanted, or loved.",1

And I have put a lot of thought into preparing to die. Imagining life without me in it. It almost excites me to see what, if anything happens after we are gone.My psychiatrist said the hospital is always an option but it is not even been that long since the last time I was there. I do not want to go because I will have my freedom taken away and have the staff thinking I am just the boy who cried wolf because I am really good at hiding how I really feel.It sucks and I feel like a complete fraud because if I was ""really"" suicidal I would have attempted it by now but there is always something holding me back and because of that I feel like nobody will take my feelings and thoughts seriously.

"This last year has been horrible.My wife and I moved last year at the beginning of the pandemic with no clue how bad it was going to be. She had a job quick and I went months without one. Then I finally took a job with Walmart that taxed my body every day because we literally cannot work fast enough for what they want.My wife and I worked separate shifts. So now I do not see her anymore, and I have a terrible job that is keeping me in physical pain. I got depressed, who the fuck would not?So I withdrew, and at the same time so did she. We had our spats and then she came and asked permission to sleep with someone else. All the self assurance I had in my marriage that my life would EVENTUALLY be okay because I still had her disappeared (I said no).Then she cheated on me. Said that she did not have a companion anymore. I understand that. I cannot forgive her yet, but I understand. Same day I found out though, I find out my grandfather has cancer. I do not have many role models, he is one of them.he is gone now, and I almost left my wife for space away from her. I did not do it. I decided that my marriage was more important than her infidelity. That our relationship was worth being hurt over because we could fix it.Now she still wants to sleep with other people. I feel worthless. That my marriage is not worth anything because some stupid fantasy is more important.I have no friends here. I have some people I game with and some of them know what is going on. I have no family here. I have no couch to crash on when I am hurt.I am just so tired. I think about walking out in the middle of the road so that I am not killing myself so to speak. I will not because I will not fuck up someone else's life in my effort to stop breathing. I do however have a plethora of blood pressure pills because no matter how much weight I lose my blood pressure is still so high that doctors try to send me to the hospital.I am just so tired. I do not know how much more I can handle. I do not know how much longer I can do this. I am so tired",1
"my depression has took a turn for the worst recently and now I am having trouble feeding myself. I have mostly just been drinking water to help get rid of the starving feeling but i think this makes me moody. I have been SO moody lately too and everyone is been driving me nuts. i do not know for sure if these symptoms are a result of not eating, but its hard to motivate myself to eat. i just do not have the energy for it and food does not taste as good as usual. even when I am high, my appetite is not too great either. i remember smoking used to make me so hungry but now it does not do the trick. does anyone else relate or have any advice maybe? i feel like I am ruining my body food",0
I am 17M scizoafftive and have no friends. I have been abused sexually physically and mentally almost my whole life. I cannot even being to tell you how many times i was hit over the head violently with objects. I have never been told i love you either by anyone in my whole life. When i vent about my problems people just tell me to man up or grow a pair your a boy. I have not slept without nightmares since i was 6. No matter what med I am put on or how much therapy i go to nothing help's me. I am pretty much crying myself to sleep every night because I am so lonely. I am pertty sure the amount of times i was hit over the head have taken a effect on me because i cannot do basic multiplication or division and my family calls me retarded because that is basic math. I am unlovable I am worthless i have no friends and pertty much no reason to live and will most likely be homeless by 18. People tell me I am to sensitive what do i honest to god have to look forward to? 17M severely abused throughout my life.,1
"This is probably going to come off as a messy bunch of writing but I have been in this weird state of just a lack of desire to keep living for a little while now, I am just getting up and going to work 5 days a week to do fuck all most weekends, i do not know how I am going to keep that up for another 40 odd years, its felt like my life has just been get up and go and I do not know why I am doing this anymore, its not even a sadness most of the time, I often want to end my life not out of depression, but out of what could only be described as a curiosity as to what is after death, right now I am in a particularly bad space right now which is what brought me here, idk I just felt like I needed to vent/express myself to anything other than myself, I am just so tired, I looked at my reflection in a mirror today and saw dark bags under my eyes, I am so damn tired, physically, mentally, emotionally, I am tired of lifes endless cycle, I am not looking for reassurance that things will get better, honestly the chances of me killing myself are quite low, but the thought of ending it all have been persistent for a while now and I need somewhere I could get all this somewhere other than just in my head All I need is for one person to see this",1

I had a mental breakdown earlier today that did not involve any crying, but me just trying to make friends with people and then having self-hatred thoughts about the way I look and the way I act.

"I am 24. I had great grades in highschool, I learn things easily. I have a partner of 4 years who is amazing. I have spent a lot of time depressed and confused about meaning in life. I was in my final year of my bachelor's in an underwhelming design degree in 2020 but 5 major personal life issues hit me in the span of a month, and the gear god worse from there.Now I have had 18 months away from any study and it is going to be 2 years by December. I cannot enroll in my units any more and I hate the degree.I know I can progress towards my goals and get there but I feel so far behind in life, and I feel like I have accomplished all the things I wanted when I was saying and irrevocably failed the rest. I feel bored with life and just like casually letting myself dying. If I go study science for 5 years I will be 30 at the end. I just think about going and drinking poison or throwing myself into rocks or something to just give up this life. I do not want to have suicidal but it is tempting to just opt out and stop the hassle of this life I want to kill myself because I do not have a job or degree, but I do not want to want to kill myself",1
"The girl in question is my best friend and I am one of hers (not speculation, she is told me that before). Yesterday we went out with our entire group of friends, had a little too much to drink and someone straight up asked if there was any attraction between members of the group. When it came to her she listed the male members of the group (like we asked her to) and she just bluntly named the guys she would like to sleep with and the 2 she really would not. Par for the course of my entire life she named me in the second group. I laughed it off but I am honestly devastated, not surprised mind you since only one girl has ever fancied me and that was over a decade ago. I must admit that before all of this happened I had a tiny sliver of hope she might fancy me since we get along incredibly well.Now before any of you think of calling her a bitch, she really is not. All of us slightly pressured her to answer the question and I personally told her to be honest about it.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for reading, even if it is only one or two of you. I have nobody to tell about this but I REALLY needed to get it off my chest. Even though I am devastated right now I am sure I will recover again like I have done time and time and time again. Unfortunately it is not the first time I am in this situation.Stay strong my friends. The girl I have been crazy about for months basically just told me I am the last guy she would ever want to be with and I have not felt this bad in 8 years.",0

"(tl;dr @ bottom)This is the first time I have experienced serious social retraction and withdrawal in my depressive disorder. Usually when I am depressed Id take a day or two to myself then contact a friend to meet and cheer myself up. I have (or had...) a great social network of friends and acquaintances in different friend groups who I genuinly all love dearly, but the pandemic, dealing with death, and other personal factors were a catalyst to probably one of my worst depressive slumps since an attempt in 2017. I have not talked to any of my friends in 4 whole months. Even when they reached out, I avoided talking to anyone. I used to use social media frequently, but I completely fell off the face of the earth. Hell, even my internet buddy started to get worried. A majority of texts are just sitting in my messages and I have not even read them yet. Only person I have talked to is my partner who I see on average once a week. 4 months later and I feel an immense amount of guilt, loneliness, and embarrassment because of my withdrawal. I noticed my close friend group even replaced me with someone else. I really want to text all my friends back, but I feel a sense of guilt and embarrassment of trying to explain myself after 4 months of completely disappearing. During my Depressive episode, I did not care. but now I am slowly getting out of it and I am dealing with the consequences. I really played myself. Anyone have any tips on how to deal with this from their experience? Or what to say to them?TL;DR: Bad depressive episode . experienced social withdrawl for the first time. have not talked to friends in months. 4 months later I am dealing with the consequences and feeling guilty as hell.

"Why the fuck do I exist. I used to want to do things with my life. I wanted to (still kind of do?) be an author and write novels that people would like and that would make them happy. I wanted people to see me, and acknowledge all of my creations. I wanted to be a great artist that made people feel how other artists made me feel. Obviously I have gotten over that. It *was* a fucking lie. I cannot do it. I am not talented enough. Even if I was there are so many talented authors but there is only 1 Tolkien, so to speak. I could never make it. Never.

"This might be downvoted to hell, but I truly do not care anymore. I also struggle with mental health, but probably suffers to a lesser extent.He has expressed multiple times he does not want to get help, despite me repeatedly asking him to. He always says self-deprecating shit like how worthless he is and how he has no friends, which hurts my feelings because am I not a friend? I do my best to be there for him but it. Is. EXHAUSTING.I met up with old classmates I have not seen in awhile, and I felt like a weight was lifted over my head. I did not have to worry about if I was triggering anyone with what I said. I did not have to listen to them hate on themselves. I realized a lot of times, conversations with my depressed friend sucked the fucking soul out of me.Yesterday I did not respond to his online messages because I wanted to keep this happy feeling a little longer. Today I woke up to him saying he wanted to k*ll himself and lamenting how hard it is to get the things necessary. I want to scream at him for being so fucking inconsiderate about how this might trigger me. All the nice feeling I was riding on just plummeted. Now I am stuck worrying about him and if hell make it till tomorrow. I wish I can tell him to find another person to lay his problems to. I wish I can tell him the things he says bums me out, to say the least. I wish I can tell him being around him makes me feel worse. But what kind of friend would I be?These things will probably hurt his feelings, and maybe drive him over the edge, which I would never ever want to do. But I am just so sick of it.

"tw// eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it, but I will try. Okay, so I always loved eating, it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid (20s now). When I was 18 or 19 (when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city) I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do, like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year (early 2020) I realized I was getting high so I can eat more/open up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier (I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS) but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food, such as hamburgers, chips, ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days, sometimes multiple in a row, where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regular-sized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So, I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing, that I am disgusted by binge eating (I still do it tho)? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this, thank you I am disgusted by food",0

"My depression feels like something that lives with me, in the corner of my room, sometimes it is just there, quiet, silent, watching me, wondering. Sometimes it attacks me without warning, without advance, it just destroys me and tears me apart in every possible way. I have been fighiting this for over 5 years, yet, seems like I always find myself in the same place, in the same room with this.., monster.. facing me. I have hated myself, pitted myself, felt numb, paralyzed, hopeless, screaming in an empty place, all possible things. Yet, I am always in the same place, in this same room with this monster watching me. Till when I will put in my mind that; ""I am okay"", ""oh it is fine it is gone"", ""I am already smiling, it is fine"" and then finding myself in the next moment, day, time, second, breathe.. with this monster crawling and looking for me again? &amp;#x200B;Sometimes I feel like I am becoming the monster myself. thoughts",0
"I am really depressed because my life is bad, not due to mental illness. I am a divorced mom with no other family, or friends, so no support system at all. Not even anyone to bounce ideas off of, get feedback etc.And I have asperger's, so have a hard time with regular jobs and work from home doing basically online gig work. But I am well educated. And I am way older than most posters here. And I am like 90 lbs and have problems with fainting sometimes. 1) I have tried therapy but that did not help at all. It made things worse. Probably because that is not the type of help I need. Plus when I told my therapist that I was feeling overwhelmed with having to do everything myself without any help, all she did was tell me how she did everything herself without any problem before she was married. And she is never had kids. 2) being locked up in a mental hospital would make things worse. In part because my issues are not a mental illness. But also, if I miss even one day of work I risk not being able to pay my rent and being homeless. So I would come out if the hospital with no place to live and none of my problems solved. - But - I am so unhappy with my life, and so over stressed with everything that I cannot live this way much longer. I wake up everyday thinking it would be better to just die because I am losing all hope that at this point in my life, that my life can get any better. Or become good enough to be worth living. I do not see how I can pull myself out of this mess entirely alone. I need some other sort of help. I am not even sure what. Maybe a family that could sort of adopt me as their kid (my parents are both dead), people who could even just pretend to be friends with me, maybe someone who could help me out now and then with stuff around the house when it just becomes too much for one person to do etc. Just something like that to make it a bit easier. Basically family and friends, or pretend ones I guess. Any ideas? Is there any way to get help that is not 1) talk therapist or 2) being in a mental hospital?",1

Even if you are sick, have been bullied, harmed you will seek heaven, heavenly father or good karma-rebirth-reincarnation-just be the good boy"". Ever since we undestood evolution, real nature of world. Ever since we understood how fake this thought of god, rebirth is. There is one dangerous spirit circulates around us-especially weaks. We have seek the real nature of question ""what is the good if there is no reward for my moral actions?"" Apperantly there is no reward for pro-social human actions. It is the opposite, sociopaths atttract both girls and men. And when we know that there is no reward nor punisment-in eternarl level-our chains are broken.

I am sorry but i need to rant about a few things. i hate everything and i just want to die but i cannot die because there are people who count on me and that makes it harder because i keep putting their problems on myself on top of my own and i cannot feel like i can breathe. and km going through some stuff which idk if i should say it but its like an identity crisis ig. and love. love is the worst thing in the world. i love somebody and ik they do not love me back and they make me feel so much more terrible about myself and so much more pain and idk what to do i just want to kms so badly but idk how and i feel like everybody is against me and nobody actually cares about me they because they never make it seem like they do and i bet that nobody would really even care if i died bc they would just forget me like they do normaly. anyways I am sorry for the rant i just needed to get it out of me I am sorry Life just sucks and is too painful,1
"I am sorry for posting this here, I feel revolting and that I do not deserve to live anymore because of this. I copied and pasted my original post from OCD. I am sorry if it makes this the wrong sub but I feel so wrong and I do not know how to atone for this.Hi, I am sorry for posting this, this is very humiliating and embarassing and I feel that I am a monster, I deserve ridicule. I cannot stop telling myself that I am some kind of psychopath pedophile/predator because of this one event that happened nearly a year ago when I was 18. This happened a month or so after another bout of POCD, so I feel like I am truly just a horrible person with bad intentions because of this. I remember I was looking to meet some friends online, and this person contacted me, and I got along with them very well, we shared many of the same interests and I felt a true connection with them, and all was well. But then they told me that they were 15, and I was taken aback by this, and I felt freaked out for a bit, especially because before I knew that I held emotions for them. But I did not immediately cease contact (I feel like I should have just stoppd there.) I remember I considered staying just friends with them, but because of my feelings for them before it made me feel like that would be wrong, and that I would have been a predator/groomer. I remember that they reassured me about that it was okay to be friends with them because they knew other people that were my age (Oh god, I feel like I should have told them that this was wrong because now I am scared that they will have gotten themselves hurt or something). I ended up consulting my best friend and they told me that it would be best to cut it off. I gave them a brief explanation as to why I cut them off, and then that was it. Nothing ""happened"", but the event left me feeling like a sick monsterPart of the reason why I keep telling myself I am a monster is because I keep having memories that I somehow thought of the possibility of it being okay? But I cannot know if I actually thought that or not, but I keep remembering like this thought where I felt they were ""mature"", but I cut them off and I KNEW it was wrong. So I am scared of what if I somehow possibly had a bad thought or intention before even though ultimately I decided to stop talking to them? Like what if I pondered it being okay? And I keep feeling sick because I remember I kind of still had like ""emotions"" for them even after I found out and I missed them for a bit? Or I think that I just missed who I thiught they were? Even though I would NEVER do anything of the sort I keep telling myself that this means I am a pedo groomer and I should turn myself in or kill myself. I am scared that all of the people in my life who love me now will hate me if these thoughts and memories are true. I have spent all day in bed trying to figure it out and it makes me feel sick to my stomach, the thing that really bothers me too is that this all happened RIGHT AFTER a previous cycle of POCD, so surely I must be a psychopath predator I cannot stop telling myself I am a predator and it is making me consider suicide.

"I have suffered more than is bearable, and it is mostly the result of my own terrible choices. Granted there were things beyond my control, but all in all I had a very good and privileged childhood, with a lot of love. There is mental illness and addiction in my family tree, my parents were both abused as children, and although they did the best with what they have I began to show symptoms of deep depression and anxiety as an adolescent. I started to experiment with drugs and drinking, and I never stopped (33 now). I am not sure which came first, the addiction or the emotional problems, but they seemed to work in tandem. I have lost everything there is to lose but my life, which is also in jeopardy due to a stroke and possible anurysm (I do not know, because doctors have been unable to diagnose me, but I pretty much know that is what is going on). Every relationship I have had has failed due to my addiction and being a terrible partner. I have not hardly touched another person in five years. I am drinking a six pack a day and using opiates. I cannot help but think of what my life could have been had I not gotten sick, had I not have into the narrative in my mind that I am inadequate and a terrible person. I cannot blame my mother for how she raised me, she was remarkably together considering the unbelievable abuse she suffered from her mentally ill mother. it is just the luck of the draw I guess, but I cannot shake the feeling that my pathetic life was my own creation (it was) and that it is not going to get better. What would make me think it is just somehow going to improve? I cannot be myself around people, I am so anxious I can barely speak and when I do it is just faking having a personality. I have no soul or integrity. I cannot even control my own behavior or stop drinking. And now my health is failing as a result. I do not think I will make it frankly but I am so afraid of the pain it would because my family that I cannot bear to go through with it. Alcoholism and opiate addiction, borderline personality disorder, and living with neurological problems resulting from a stroke and unruptured aynurism.",1

"So I run a club at my local university, I am president. There are several members who maybe out of jealousy dislike me immensely. I know this for a fact because they constantly question anything I do, and make dumb impressions of me. They frequently try to ""roast"" me if you get what I mean, and not in the funny, friendly way, just plain rudely. Yesterday, I said, I have reached ""1k games, if you count the other website"". One of them, let us call him ""T"" exclaims ""Great you can do math!"". Stuff like that, every single day, and they constantly criticize and question for me. But here is where I draw the line. There is a girl I like, and I have never told anyone, but one of the members who hates me is going after her, and trying to call her and stuff. I do not know what he is saying behind my back, but I guarantee it is negative stuff, probably like ""I am gay or something"", or something negative like ""He has problems"". I am furious, I do not have proof, but yesterday he hinted in a very laughably way ""I was talking to this GIRL for 3 hours lol"" and he was laughing. I trust her, but I am very hurt that I am being targeted like this, I do not want to resign as president over something as silly as this, but it is getting me to the point where I am very visibly stressed and depressed. What should I do? The girl is overseas so it is impossible for them to harass other than frequently call/text, etc. Am I being a worrywart? Should I just chill? What would you do?

"Hi, this is a new account I made just to say this. I have been suffering from depression for a while and that has caused me so many things, I have almost commited suicide before, I have gotten an F, a few W's and Incompletes in college but somehow I managed to survive.On top of my problems, there is a lot going on in my life. I am doing a (summer) college class for the 3rd time and a few days into it, my good friend unexpectedly died. I have a midterm tomorrow which is 30% of my grade and because of this horrible news, I have been depressed, unable to function and I have to make up 10 two hour lectures for the midterm tomorrow. On top of this, due to the pandemic, my father has lost his job and we are about to sell my house because we need the money.The thing is, I have a loving and supportive family, my friends really care about me and I know a lot of people will be affected if I am not here. All I can think about is how to I die and not make it look like I committed suicide. I feel really alone even though I know that there are so many people who care. But I still called my friend because I needed warmth? but I just could not tell him what was wrong with me so I just hung up. I spend most of my time in my room and when I go out of it, I put on a smile in front of my parents but I feel like I have the world on my shoulders. There was a time where I used to tell my really close friends everything, including stuff like this, but for a while I have stopped doing that. I was just listening to music and sobbing. I have had weeky therapy for over 6 months but it just is not working. With my last therapist, I was in such a state also, and I told her what I was feeling, and she told my father what I told her and I felt so hurt by it. So here I am today, feeling the same things but I am unable to tell my current therapist how I am feeling because I am scared that she will tell my parents.Sorry if this is too long and too heavy for whoever is reading this. I just typed what was in my head. I do not want to give up, I just feel so much pain for so long and nothing has helped.

"I cannot stop crying. I have been in so much emotional and mental stress that my body is hurting 10x more. I have not been this sad in awhile. it is the kind sad that lays deep in your chest. Almost like when you are anxious and the butterflies are in your tummy. But the butterflies are in my lungs and I cannot breathe right. No amount of crying or screaming or sobbing is taking away the pain. No amount of deep breathes are making it feel okay. I just so badly want to be okay. I want to be okay. I really just need to be okay.I have no where to put this anger. I used to hurt myself and that is all that I want right now. I just want to hurt myself because I hate myself. I am the reason I am this fucking miserable. Because my fucking body refuses to heal. I want so badly to hurt myself physically. it is the only thing that makes me feel better. I injure the thing that is causing me pain. And the pain I because myself helps me stop thinking of how shitty of an excuse of a human I am. I really do not think life should be this hard. If this is how it is suppose to be for me, then I want out.My body is in so much pain 24/7 that it starts feeling all mental. How long will I last like this? How long can someone go day by day in this much pain and not wish for death.This is where it gets tricky, because I love my family. But at this point all I do for my family is hold them back. And make them sad. I hate myself so much and I do not know how to stop. I want to hurt myself but I am already in so much pain. I want this all to just stop. I need strength. So badly.

"preface is that i do actually suffer from clinical depression and i used to take 150mg zoloft but I have been off that bc i moved and my psychiatrist does not accept how far i moved so I am out of meds. the withdrawal sucked for a few weeks but I am feeling okay now. my problem comes from the fact that i need to get a job. normally it takes me a few months to get over the decision making stage of work or commit suicide and I am over that stage now and decided to work but I am just stuck here now because the closest place is like a 30 minute bike ride? i applied anyways and they have not gotten back to me but I am just concerned because i do not think I am strong enough to just bootstrap my way into both learning to ride and riding 5 days a week in 90+ degree weather. i have a few months left to live where i stay unless i get a job and my accounts are all depleted so I am just like okay yeah let us get a job but i rode there once and i had to literally sit and pant for like 15 minutes lol. i do not doubt that its possible bc i see people all the time but it just feels like its dangerously hot for me and everything thinks its just because I am from a colder climate but the temperature out here is enough to put me on my ass easily, i just do not have any other way to get money.. and i do not know if I am strong enough to take that trip but even worse is that its been 2 weeks and i have not gotten a call back. if this place does not hire me then I am screwed and ill have to bike even further or die so I am just like fuck what do i do! sorry i just woke up and this is more of a rant but this scenario has been on my mind forever. i considered ubering to work if i get hired but idk i do not know if I am lazy or not",0

Really?? Is this all there is? I constantly wonder why people seem to be so positive about things. I wake up every day dreading life. Its really just all so pointless.

"I have been doing so well with treating my anxiety and poor body image, I am in counselling, I have supportive friends. I feel so selfish for feeling like this. I feel like I am disrespecting and making a mockery of people who have killed themselves because I know if I worked at it I could make this horrid feeling go away. But I am just so tired. Mentally I am completely exhausted. My mum was just diagnosed with yet another serious disease and because her immune system is already weak as hell from her medication it could be potentially fatal. My dad blames her 'bad lifestyle' for it so they are constantly screaming at each other -- they both want a divorce, but cannot afford one. I am so sick of trying to block out the arguing and I do not know what to do anymore. I am probably going to die young anyway because the disease is hereditary and every single female in my mum's bloodline has gotten some form of it. Yeah, I could take medication for the rest of my life, but is it worth it? there is nothing even wrong with me. I got good grades in my mock exams (I am 15 and in secondary school), I have such nice friends but all they seem to do is annoy me now. I know they do not mean to. it is my fault. I am doing stupid shit I never would have done a month ago like taking more painkillers than necessary and walking out of lessons to hide in the toilets until the end of the day. For reference, this time last month I had severe anxiety and would not even speak in lessons. Now I am leaving them without asking and snapping when I do not get my way. I even fucking told a teacher yesterday that I felt like hurting myself, that I felt suicidal, and I had to sit in her office while she called my mum and put the phone on speaker so I heard what she had to say about it. I have stopped looking both ways before I cross the road, stopped caring about what other people think about me, started shutting out everybody who cares, and when I get home I just cry. that is it. Cry and sleep. it is so absurd to me because I read what I am writing and I sound pathetic -- so many people do worse things than this and I feel so wrong for wanting to die but I am just done. I do not know what to do anymore. Anyhow I have one last day of school left before the summer holidays which is 6 weeks long in the UK so that is 6 weeks to do nothing but sit alone and think. My counsellor's calling me after school but I think I might just ignore it. I think I might overdose this summer. it is probably a temporary feeling that will be gone in a few days but I just needed to get it all out y'know? That way if I do end up offing myself in at least my parents will have some idea of what I was feeling when they look through my phone. I am just tired. Scared. I think. Does anyone know how much paracetamol is considered an overdose? it will deter me if suddenly this seems more real. This summer I might end it all",1

"*What triggered me*Today I found out that the father of my ex best friends died. I was shocked and sad even tho I am not friends with them anymore I still feel bad for them. In the last few months I thought about what would I do if something happened to my parents-well probably die right after. The reality hit me like a truck with the death of their father, which showed me the reality. I am basically living for my parents, this would be terrifying to me because besides them no one cares about me, and I do not have anyone else who I care about. I am now 18 years old and horrified of life, the main thing why is because I cannot live with myself. I just hate myself so much that I cannot participate in any hobbies or do stuff I need to do to live a good life- I just feel empty but also guilty because not everyone has privileges that I do. I do not want to be myself, I never wanted to be. I am a MDDer, because of that I do not live in the real world but escape into my fantasies. Instead of doing this shit which does not do anything for anyone, I should sacrifice myself for others, go work and be helpful- maybe not like Ghandi or mother Teresa- but a similar kind of helpful. I am not going to live for myself: I do not want a family(husband/wife), kids, partners and friends-I have to live for others(the general society), someone has to *Why I hate myself*(My monolog is not structured, I jumped from one thought to another)it is long and probably not worth your time but here it goes: I hate how empty I am, how I always say the wrong things and always care about the wrong people. I have managed to make people hate me who actually liked me in the beginning. There is no such thing in me that I would call *The self*, I do not even have a persona/ social mask. I am not a person, just a vessel filled with contradicting emotions- I am empty, without an identity even tho I have searched for it my whole teenage life. I never had ambitions nor future plans besides killing myself when I am 18 (In my dreams I did have ideas for the future but I saw them as unreachable and gaved them up, leaving them in my head instead of making them reality ).. well technically I am *dead* inside now. I cannot cry or shout at someone else but I was always the one who was shouted at- they were right I am a piece of shit I am not going to lie and pretend otherwise but it still hurts because I am trying to be good but always do something wrong,I am so fucking stupid and pathetic, I am a bad person naturally and suck at even being a decent person. I felt so guilty because of my behaviour that I did not went to school for about 6 months, made a lot of trouble etc. and all that just so I could punish myself and provoke myself to finally attempt suicide. Obviously no one knows that and they also do not care. You know what is also fucking gross about me,its going to be embarrassing but in my teenage years (12-16/17) I was unhealthy obsessed with love. I am not a person that has a lot of crushes, I have had just a few, three to be more specific. I hate myself for that but my obsessive behaviour was disgusting and embarrassing. Basically I always had a long crush on someone, the longest was for about three years. Instead of doing what most do, going to your crush after idk one month asking them out or befriending them, I stalked them on social media etc. which seems fine to most, but I also tried to meet this person in town and purposefully went where I thought they might be. Next to that I was in a delsuion that this person will rescue me. You see shit like that in skins as example where the infamous effy had two guys trying to help her and ""rescue"" her. I was not inspired by movies or shows, its more like that this unhealthy attachment stamps from everyone hating or ignoring me, that is why I assumed that this person could save me from my normal life. This particular person was the only one who cared even tho I was not friends with them. Heck, my friends cared less about me than this person who seemed genuinely concerned about me. I did not like the person at first and did not even bother to be friendly with them but after seeing how they cared I could not resist and developed feelings, I started to crave for this persons attention and love. I was (and partly still am) to some extend obsessed with my emotions which made (makes) me behave like an narcissist ( maybe I am one). My emotions ruled my life, nothing mattered but this person, because in my eyes I *loved* them, this *love* filled the void that my self hatred created. I wanted so badly that they rescue me from this life. that is where my obsession came from. I hate my personality, and I also happened to be ugly and dumb lol such a waste of air. Yes I am a plain Jane, I hope I will look better, because even tho I am empty inside, but if my vessel ever becomes pretty than people will not annoy me(negative harrassment like bullying) anymore. And the *dumb part* is self explanatory. There is a lot more but I am way too lazy to write that down now, I will edit this post if something new comes to my mind.btw .

"I mentioned to a close friend that I was dealing with a lot of anxiety and feeling really bad this week. I did not really expect their reply. It was along the lines of ""individual stuff does not matter right now, the world's in crisis."" - I was really hurt because it just felt like having my struggle belittled and also I was angry because I found it hard to believe that with the level of mental health awareness these days that someone could say something so off when it is not even like I often vent (first time in half a year I have even opened up) so I know I am not a burden. I got angry, told them, and then got sadder, told them that too. It started badly with them saying that I was taking offence at nothing, ended better - but i feel pathetic now, having to explicitly ask a close friend to treat me properly. This has set me off on a shame/depression spiral and I have been crying and cannot get out of bed since. Just feeling worse and worse, piling shame on top of shame.

As to what kind and to what extent, I do not know yet. I do have a question about looking for help though. Since the good old American Healthcare system is so cost-effective, I would like to try be as efficient as possible in getting to the point where I can actually start to get the help I need. I have had people recommend seeing a therapist first, and working from that point forward. I have also had people recommend I see a family doctor first and be formally diagnosed with whatever it may be that is going on and then continuing from there. Looking at this from the standpoint of cost effective treatment, have you had any experience in ""getting the run around"" from one party while the other seemed to be much more efficient? I know I need to get the ball rolling, but I would prefer to do so without breaking my bank. Finally admitting I need help",0
"Does anybody else experience this? Almost every time I get good news, I do not celebrate. Yesterday I got accepted to a yoga teacher training program. I think it will help keep me accountable and provide a much needed community to me. I think it will be a good thing. But upon hearing the news, I went kind of numb. Its like since its real then the real work of it all becomes real too? It sort of feels like just another task looming in the future. What about you? Have you had similar experiences? Happy things feel like sad things",0
"After 24 years of painful existence, it is clear I should have ended things much earlier. I cannot seem to do anything right. My mind has never been happy or at peace, and medications help but have never been a real solution. I have lived off my parents all my life and have never worked a real job. I am always lonely but have never made a move because I know deep down I would make an awful partner. I have not so much as held hands or kissed a girl, and all completely for a lack of trying - a truly pathetic record befitting of a failure like myself.I do not know why I enrolled in nursing anymore. We learn in the classroom to fight for our patients but I have been burned every time I try to. Apparently I do not speak ""like a professional"". This clinical rotation has broken me; next week, I am going to act like the robot they want us to be and get shit done, not spend time actually getting to know the people I am caring for. I have written so many reflections, completed so many learning plans, that I just cannot take failing again at this point. I refuse to try again; if I fail despite my best efforts, I will take it as a message that I am just not meant for this world.My family and few friends will be especially saddened, I know, but I am just so tired. I have stayed this long for their sake, but I think it is time to prioritize myself for once. I cannot bear telling any of them, I hate being a burden. This post is my way to vent and say my goodbyes. I will delete this post if by some miracle I pass; otherwise, I suppose this is farewell. My fingers are shaking right now and I want to cry; I have not planned this far before, but it is long overdue. If you are reading this, take care of yourself, do not waste your time on me. Thanks for taking the time to hear my thoughts. If I fail next week, I am calling it quits",1
"I am feeling every day more and more depressed even when I was about to recover finally. I am tired of living with my family, they spend the whole day fighting each other or ignoring me at some point. I want to go to the country and chill for once but I got to spend my 2 week holidays making school stuff so I cannot even relax by watching a tv show or smth like that. I want to make so many things but I cannot cuz my mom will not let me be in peace for 1 second. I do not want to kms neither, I wanted to cut my veins again so I can feel pain but I cannot find a razor and if I want to buy one I got to go w someone of my family cuz I cannot move by myself. I do not got friends, I do not feel loved since I was like 4/5 and idk how to make at least one friend. Thx for reading if you did, take care Idk what to do",0
"I think this could also be posted in unpopular opinion. If I decide to take a nap and do not set an alarm, I can easily sleep 3-4 hours and still get to sleep at bedtime. I usually hit snooze though and sleep a little longer. Its very rarely that I have trouble getting to sleep at bedtime after taking a nap. I assume its the depression and anxiety I deal with or a combination of this and my PCOS but I have always been this way. Anyone else relate or thoughts on why this is? One does not take a nap without setting an alarm.",0

"i do not do anything, things just happen to me. I am powerless. I cannot survive on my own, i cannot leave my house, i do not feed myself, i can barely work for a few hours sitting at a computer before getting exhausted. Exhaustion that makes the chest feel heavy and the eyes drop and I just feel like screaming. I cannot bear the responsibility of being alive, i just exist, I wake up, i look for reasons to get up, cannot find any so I just do because I am expected to, not because I really want it.Its all so taxing, so tiring. ANd to be honest I do not want to get better, I just want to rest. I do not understand where do people draw the strenght to keep waking up everyday voluntarily. Then again I have nothing to cling on. no friends, no future, no goals or ambitions and there is always the temptation and the choice to just quit. I am past the point of wanting friends. I am scared of friendships, I have not have one since middle schoolI m not going to get vaccinated. TPTB do not care about me, so why so suddenly do they want me to get a shot? its in my best interest you say? no, dying is my best interest. I already had covid back in february. I was a coward, I will not kill myself, death will come to me, like everything in life. complaining will not solve anything but I do not care, I never accomplish anything either I am not fully commited to living and never will be",1

"I am stuck in an awful job I cannot stand in the construction industry. The boss is a slave driver, we are understaffed, we keep getting more and more projects every day, I am in charge of half of them even though I have very little experience, and our customers are constantly asking for faster and faster deadlines that the CEOs keep obliging without asking us.I have been looking for a new job for almost a year and have gotten no replies, despite reworking my resume and having it reviewed countless times.I want to quit, but that would mean no more money, which means no more anything.But I just keep getting angrier and more tired every day, and eventually I just will not be able to work anymore. Worse, I may end up snapping and strangling my boss or one of my coworkers!I am almost 30 and have no significant other and very few friends, and most things that used to make me happy no longer do so. I am constantly thinking about work and what horrors the next day will bring.I do not know what else to do except kill myself. it is either that, or be stuck in this endless hell forever.I do theoretically have enough money to live a year without work, but since I have had no replies from applications, I may never get another job. It also does not help that I have no real idea what I actually want to do; I not only hate my job, but I hate my field as well!What the hell am I supposed to do???

"Does my life really just come down to my time at college, struggling and beating myself up for every imperfection, to working to make a living and be successful. I mess up so much more often than I did in high school and I just wonder if it will ever get good. Besides a few close friends I feel myself unable to connect with people my age. An amalgamation of failure, the desire to be better, and the mental exhaustion prohibiting that effort makes me so sad when looking forward to the future. I feel weak thinking about my future",0
"I just want to know what its like, just fucking once. I have gone my whole fucking life without it. My dad hit me more times than he hugged me. My mum did not give two shits about me, tried to kill herself 3 times before I even turned 12 just to prove that point. And that is not to mention all the other shit they both put on me. Never even had friends growing up, moved around too much, just did my best to assimilate with new groups by wearing masks and leaving them behind just as quickly.Only ever had one friend in adulthood. Think she did care about me for a while, but I fell in love with her and she did not feel the same way. Between that and my constant mentally ill bullshit, guess I scared her away because she is barely spoken to me at all for almost 2 years now and I have not seen her in just as long.Never had a girlfriend either. cannot imagine it would be anything but a total fucking disaster and I do not think I can handle losing someone I actually care about because of my own bullshit again. Tried using shit like Tinder but it fucking sucks. Besides, I know I am not good enough for a relationship so what the fuck am I even trying to accomplish by asking women out? Sex is just fucking pointless to me at this point so I really do not know what the end goal is and I just stop bothering.I know people say you have got to love yourself first but I do not know what the fuck that feels like because I have nothing to go off. Feels like I am caught in an endless cycle of cannot be loved till I love myself and cannot love myself until I learn what being loved is like. Its fucking torture. do not even think it fucking matters anymore, think I have lost the ability to be around people anymore anyway. cannot handle it. Every time I have tried to make myself be around people or make new friends I just get fucking agitated with everyone and want to be left the fuck alone. cannot even hold down a job anymore because I cannot speak to the public on a regular basis without doing shit that gets me fired. People just aggravate me and I do not know how to fix that. Medication does not fix it, does not do fucking anything, neither does therapy. Guess there is no solution.Just so fucking sick of being completely alone in the world, having to do all this shit by myself every fucking day, with nothing ever getting better or easier. And its a fucking catch 22 because the longer this shit goes on the harder it gets to be around anyone, the worse my truest issues get and the more I realise I am probably always going to be fucking unstable to some degree and Ill never be good enough to have relationships and shit because I have got nothing to offer but chaos and self-destruction. I just wish one fucking person loved me",0
"what is stopping me? there is so many ways I could just end everything tonight. No one would have to deal with my shit anymore. Everyone would be free of my burden and they would be the better for it. So why do not I?what is holding me here? Maybe I am afraid that this will pass, that eventually I will be ok, but I do not want to be ok because then I do not have an excuse, which is so fucking selfish and lazy, is not it? I would rather bring people down with me than put in the work to be better. And I cannot even fucking bring myself to do the one thing that would make everyone happier permantely. Because all I do is screw everything up, even right now I should be talking to someone, but I cannot because I am scared they will give me pity, or concern, or try to help me and I will fail them again and again, but no one will ever give up on me. Why will not everyone just give up on me so I can finally give up on myself? I could end it all right now",1
"I work in fast food because I had to drop out of college because I tried to commit suicide 3 times and was so depressed that I could not go to class. Now it is too late and I failed a lot of classes and cannot go back. I got As in highschool, was several years ahead in 2 subjects, scored very high on an IQ test, and was constantly reminded of how successful I will be by my teachers. Well guess what. I dropped out and make 12/hour while also paying my dad the insurance and car money I owe him, plus a bunch of bills and do not even have a place. I suffer from malnourishment which causes me to get sick and miss EVEN MORE work. This leads to being even more broke and my bank account hits 0 a week before I get paid. I am 6 feet tall but I weigh 125lbs and can barely lift anything because I am so weak and frail from malnourishment. I have tried doing UberEats to help, and it worked, but suddenly my car has some issues I cannot afford to fix yet. I am screwed and I am eventually going to die anyway in lots of pain from malnourishment, so why not end it now? what is the point of living if I do not make enough to?",1
Is it even possible for me to live a happy fulfilling life? Will I ever be genuinely happy again?,0
"Look I do not really use reddit much, this is my first time actually making a post so forgive me if I somehow mess it up- and I am insanely shy, even pressing the post button takes me lots of build up.. Anyways, ever since I was young I always had thoughts of suicide, but through my entire life I have just tried ignoring them.My mom ( her being a single mom due to a divorce from my father abusing drugs and being abusive to all of us which I would rather not delve into ) did not have much spare time to spend with me and my sister. However my sister would frequently spend loads of time with my dad, he even called her his real son. They had a very strong connection despite everything. My sister was insanely smart throughout highschool and college, always top of her class, played all kinds of sports, knew exactly what she wanted out of life since she was like 6. I will skip all her merits and get to the point. She was always the center of attention, and everyone, I mean everyone wanted me to be just like her, because if she could do it, surely I could to right? In school I was known as ""her brother"", no one knew who I was and neither did I.I did spend some time with my dad as a kid, whether it was him taking me to vandalize mailboxes, go hunting which I hated, or just do anything you can imagine, luckily I rejected most of what he considered fun and strived to be better. When I was 4 and my sister was 7 he took us into the woods, left us, then drove off telling us to find a way home. And no, he did not hide around and watch us to make sure we were safe, he left us all alone and went out with some random chick to further his many affairs only for us to make it home hours later after someone driving on a dirt road found us. I am giving this as an example of what he did daily, I could dive into the story of him pulling out two of my teeth way before they were ready because he once spilled a thing of popcorn and wanted to take his anger out on someone.My mom on the other hand was a great mother, she did everything she could for us and I owe her everything.I was never a trouble maker despite my childhood experiences, I strangely loved following rules, and was always a nice person genuinely. Also I should clarify, I live in the middle of nowhere and my passions have always been with technology, which is not very available out here. Also another thing, i lied like a lot, a lot a lot, without ever feeling bad, I have always had those edgy teenage thoughts about really messed up stuff being just a joke.READ STARTING HERE IF THIS IS TOO LONGI'm leaving out a lot as I just realized how long this is, basically I felt like I never figured out who I was, or what I wanted, like everything I told myself I wanted was just what everyone else wanted me to do. I always had extreme anxiety, I have never cared about relationships ( have 0 sexual desire ) and most importantly I feel like I am always in my head, talking to myself constantly and even sometimes speaking out loud without noticing, all my symptoms were and still are ignored, I did experience sadness most everyday but tried my best to hide it. Even in school I wanted to do better because I knew I could but never allowed myself to try. ||| IMPORTANT PART. Weirdest of all everyone around me sometimes feels.. automated? Like their entire lives and emotions are running like a machine. I have always thought that maybe I am supposed to be like that and I was just missing something mentally, like I was defective and became self aware. |||My ""depression"" if you can call it that feels more like an error code, and feeling this way I suppose is what makes me feel suicidal, like I am flawed, not good enough and should not exist.I want things out of life, I want to move out, I want to learn about software development, I want to get a job again yet I always feel insanely weak, like moving my body is a challenge. Simple tasks like washing dishes became a days worth of tasks. Plus I can never catch onto social norms, things just fly over my head. With simple things being so difficult it makes big goals seem impossible, I have no motivation. I feel like I am lazy even though I do not want to be.Being this way makes me feel incredibly selfish, at least I have always been told that. Suicide was considered the most selfish possible thing by my mom and all I want to do is make her proud of meI tried joining the airforce, scored a 92 on my asvab without even studying but at MEPS I had a mental breakdown and felt I would go through with suicide If I kept lying to myself and I knew that was a no go in the military, so I backed out at the last moment which only made me feel like an even bigger failure.I do not know if I should see a doctor. Maybe I am overreacting and just dramatic, I wish I could keep talking and say everything but it is just too much to say. Every second I think of ending it, and its incredibly hard to focus on improving myself when that is always blaring in my brain.TLDR: less than average childhood, always alone through life, feel weak at all times. Mind is constantly blaring for me to kms ( not like voices, just talking to myself ) Everyone feels like a robot. I want to get better but at the same time I am not sure if its worth the effort, or if I can even get better. I am almost convinced it would just be easier to end it all now and save myself from more suffering as I know my life is not even that bad, meaning it could get worse. My depression feels more like a calculation, just like everything in my life, and the most logical answer I could find is to end it since its easier than fixing it. I am sorry this is so long. I have just held a lot in for a long time and this is my first time ever trying to talk about it, if anyone took time to read this I greatly appreciate it I am confused and feel selfish",1
"Its getting harder to continue living. I feel like I have already died inside many years ago. And this deep depression keeps coming back though I have talked it through with friends, read articles to try to cope. I am incredibly lonely even though I have friends and family.

I am really having a hard time finding a reason to stay.",1
"Hey all! I would like your suggestions for reverse SAD. I have been suffering with my depression for over 10 years, its mostly manageable but I have noticed it gets DRAMATICALLY worse in the summer. I cannot STAND the heat and find myself just wanting to stay in bed with the AC blasting and fan on until it gets cool out. In the fall/winter/spring, I do so much better with my depression and find myself loving to go on long walks with my dogs, exploring nature, and generally just a better mood.&amp;#x200B;Since I obviously cannot change the weather, does anyone have suggestions for me? (Other than the pool---I just moved and do not have any friends yet and feel really weird about going to the pool alone. ) Reverse SAD/Depression in the summer?",0
"Okay, so to start off, I am a pretty depressed individual. Been mildly suicidal for many years and would rather be dead than live my life. I am aware that I have made my own mistakes in life.&amp;#x200B;The root of my depression lies in the fact that I have a terminally ill dad. I also had severe cystic acne which left a ton of scars on my face, so you can guess how my social life is. Before my cystic acne, I was actually an outgoing and friendly individual, but then after the horrible 10+ years of cystic acne and now their scars, I have become an introverted jerk that does not even like people looking at him.&amp;#x200B;To top it all off, I was studying for jobs before the pandemic began, and now because of that, the exams have all been thrown off schedule for an entire year, and my prep has gone to shit. So I am also jobless.&amp;#x200B;Oh and yes, the aforementioned terminal illness that my father has? I also might possibly have it in the future because I took some tests and I have the factors within me.&amp;#x200B;So currently, since my dad is also off his job because of the illness, and I am jobless, my mom is the sole bread winner of our family. This alone puts so much of stress on me. Most days, I feel like I cannot do shit because of the depression. I feel like all my efforts are in vain.&amp;#x200B;So you can see that I am not exactly a happy person. But all the reasons mentioned above are not why I have come to rant in here. No, that reason is my grandma.&amp;#x200B;I have three grandmas. Sisters. The oldest of them(the current grandma in question), is just that, old. So she is kind of senile. She also cannot hear a thing(we have to literally shout in her ear to tell her something), and she forgets most of everything after some time. I do not even talk with her, I just nod or shake my head when she asks me something because she cannot hear a thing.&amp;#x200B;So first off, she cannot hear a thing, and then when she does hear a thing, she forgets it after a few minutes. So you can see how frustrating it is already, right? Now, she is also convinced that her own sisters(the other two) are thieves, so she is constantly cursing them when she is alone in her room. And since I am at home the whole day, I constantly hear her cursing. This constant cursing just gives me SO much stress.&amp;#x200B;She also has the pains that every old person gets, you know, in the joints, etc. She has intense pain in her left eye socket, for which btw we have taken her to several doctors and tho they have given us vitamins and whatnot, they have said that pain is mostly psychological. Gran ofcourse, does not know any of this, so she constantly asks for medicine, constantly complains of the pain, constantly calls me again and again and again, either to ask for some medicine(which I have given her like ten minutes ago) or to tell me to call a doctor, or to complain how her legs or her eyes are paining.&amp;#x200B;At first, yes, it is pitiful and you feel sad when an old person complains of such pain, right? You do what you can to make that pain go away. But when this thing goes on for months and months and months. When you hear her constantly complaining, constantly cursing, constantly calling your name..... How do you think it feels?&amp;#x200B;Like absolute hell. that is what. And I love her. she is like a second mom to me, she practically raised. So I am in such a dilemma. I feel guilty the whole day because she asks for medicine, but when I say no(because she is already taken them) she starts cursing me too. Calling me selfish, etc. it is makes my blood boil,because I have my own depression killing me on the inside and then there is her on the outside. I sometimes feel like slapping her, because her curses are so nasty. Imagine loving someone but also feeling so angry that you just want to punch them in the face. What moral dilemma that puts you into. How guilty that makes you feel. And since I cannot go out because of my social insecurity thanks to a face full of horrible acne scars, I am at home all day. And she keeps calling only me. Even if my whole family is there, she only calls me. Over and over and over. To repeat the same question(""Did I take my medicine?""). I know it is not her fault. That she cannot control it. But that even worse you know. Because you can even blame them and yet they make you want to kill yourself. So please, any advice? What am I supposed to do? I feel like a jerk all day. Like I am a nasty person.....&amp;#x200B;And what is more, because of dad's illness, he is also frustrated, right, and so he also behaves like a jerk towards everyone(always angry, short tempered, thinks only he is correct, etc) so voila! Another person who is angry at me and insults me all the time but I cannot do anything because he is sick. I have to understand.&amp;#x200B;But who the fuck is going to understand me? Who the fuck is going to understand that I also have depression? That I also feel angry. Whenever I show my anger, the other members of my family guilt me by saying that I am supposed to understand, that those others that I am angry at, are sick, etc. I just wish I would never been born tbh. That I never existed. Then I would not have had to face all these shitty situations. I never even asked to exist. To be born.&amp;#x200B;So please any input is appreciated. Thank you. Some advice please. Because I am seriously losing itvhere",0

I am 22. My whole life I have struggled with mental illness. Everyday I struggle with severe anxiety and depression. Sometimes I also struggle with suicide. Its gotten so bad that I finally convinced my parents to be okay with me going to the doctors to try medication. My appointment is coming up and my parents keep making their disapproval evident. They are extremely against medication for mental illness but they are tolerating it because they blame my depression and anxiety for why I am such a disappointment in their eyes. However they are still not happy abt it. When I first talked to them abt it I thought they were finally on my side but it does not seem that way anymore. Its just really hard when it feels like your parents are against you. It especially sucks cuz I have actually been on kind of a mental high lately but this has really brought it all crashing down again. My Parents Are Mad At Me For Needing Medication,0

"I feel nothing in my soul right now. To be honest, I feel that I will die eventually because of a mental stroke and I would not be able to stop myself.I do not have so much friends around that can help me. To be more simple, they does not know about my mental state/and emotions. Some time I had encourage to live because of my girlfriend. She was the only one person to know what is what and she tried to help me. Yes, she was the only person who could change me and make me forget all my problems from the past, in fact she did so.But everything's changed. We simply started to argue few times in a month because either she or me disagreed on something which made both of us mad at each other. There was the last arguing when I said: \- Either we do something with our relationship, or we break up. I cannot stand this and etc.She decided to change. We started to chat as usually, we had frequent video chats, we sent memes to each other and everything seemed to go fine. But one day, she wrote:\- Do you remember when you said either we change something in our relationship or we break up? I am picking to break up. Sorry, I did not want to hurt you.After this message I got blocked and everything that was bright and beautiful turned dark and horrible. I started to drink alcohol more frequently.

I get so upset sometimes and wonder why people treat me so awfully and she gets treated so well for doing nothing and is not even nice to people. Siblings am I right? (Rant),0

But I really keep thinking like ""maybe today something will happen and this nonstop pain will end.""Worst of all, even tho I know this job is triggering this, I cannot leave, because I really need this money to pay my studies and to live. My best friend and ex-gf is the only person who I usually talked about this Crysis, but recently she had her own Crysis and I cannot tell her about it because I cannot put her mental health in danger.I just feel like a little part of me dies every fucking minute and I need it to stop. I do not even know exactly why I am feeling this, but I want to stop so bad that sometimes I think about ending it all... I am almost at the limit of sadness I have felt in years",1
"I am a very ugly person. I wish I looked like everyone else, then life would be perfect like theirs. I have never been in a relationship or kissed a girl, god forbid lose my virginity. It is not worth living in my body. If only people cared about personality and not only looks. I am only happy when I put myself in other people's skin and imagine what life would be like as them. Luckily I have a bunch of fucked up health stuff so nature will take its course soon. If not in the next year I will probably take my own life. I do not actually have anyone in my life who would care if I killed myself so luckily I will not feel guilty while doing it. Not worth living when you are ugly",1

"I wish I was not born human, but rather an animal.Animals do not have to pay bills or slave their life just to gather enough money to retire and travel. Animals are not stressed about payments. They are free to explore and live as they please. Yeah they have predators but I would still rather fear that then my future of my mundane life.Not only that but screw people. When a bear or tiger sees you, you know it is intentions; It wants to eat you. When you see a deer, you know it wants nothing to do with you. With people you never know their true intentions. People are more cruel then animals. Yes there are a few good people in this world but it is the equivalent of swimming in poop while rarely finding a diamond.Animals also usually do not experience anxiety or depression. Most cases of them having those illnesses is because of being in captivity by humans. I wish I was not born human.",0

"[a vent, I suppose] My age range is 18-25. I am still 'young'. I was always a person who felt young at heart even 3 years into depression because I liked childish things like cartoons and toys and sweets. But something happened last year and I stopped feeling that way and lost love for those things. Now, I feel no longer like a young person but old and tired. I am tired all the time and fed up with the world. I want to disengage from it; already isolated myself from most my friends. Before I felt isolated from my age group because I was too childish, but now I feel isolated because I feel too old for /all this/. I feel like my life is nearing its end and I do not want to go on. I just go day to day without doing much at all because things do not excite me like they used to. Sometimes I look in the mirror and check if I am growing wrinkles or white hair because I wonder if my outside will reflect my inside. Why do I feel old? Did something happen to my psychology? Before I felt like a sad child inside but now I feel like an old man waiting to die. Why did I miss the middle stage of growing up? I know happy old people exist, but I just feel done: pessimistic and tired. Still 'young' but feel 'old'",0

"I have not seen my 7 year old daughter in a couple of months because she moved across the country with her mom, and it has literally been killing me. My mind was telling me our relationship was damaged forever because of this. She is the only bright spot in my entire life. I have just been alternating between drinking and crying, mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time, we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it, so can you, hopefully. My daughter just pulled me out of a black pit of despair",0

Covered my whole body with bruises and cuts, and by whole body I mean whole body, like, my ass and genitals too, my neck, my face, my fingertips.I hate myself more without makeup than with, but I cannot just do makeup in one go. It takes hours because I need breaks because seeing my own face deforming in the mirror makes me cry, I am so fucking ugly. I sleep about 2-3 hours every day, sometimes I do not sleep at all. He told me to drink lemon balm tea and that we all have bad moments and I do not need psychiatric treatment. I asked for something for sleep. He said he will not give me anything because I would eat the whole pack at once as a suicide attempt. Huh, I am glad that I am finally all good and healthy. Apparently I am ok. My new psychiatrist said that.",0
"Hello everyone,I am considering starting psychotherapy (again). I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically, even if there is nothing going on, I feel constant anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money). This also causes my anxiety. &amp;#x200B;I appreciate any thought, idea, and help. Thank you :) How can I overcome my feelings of anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain?",0
"I am 23(m) and I have been dealing with depression since I was 14 (that was when I was diagnosed) and anxiety since I was 3 (separation anxiety from 3-8, social anxiety since)TLDR: Read the last large paragraph, I do not know how I can condense it more than thatWhen I was 3 my parents broke up, I was always close to my mum and to my dad I was more of an object to be owned than his son, but because he believed he deserved to have me he fought my mum for me. I know he did not care because I anytime I was with him I was put aside and never really interacted with and when I did not want to go with him he would pry my off a lamppost while I was crying and drag me to the car to take me to his house. All of this is what brought the first sembalances of my anxiety and low self esteem because if my own blood does not really love me then I took it as there was something wrong with me. And to top it off he cheated on my mum which is why they broke up and he did it before and after they were together with other women.After that my mum remarried and her next partner was fine at first but he changed when they had my younger brother. After that I was treated as a hindrance and due to the troubles of on going custody and court stuff my dad was causing during there relationship, my mum's partner saw me as my father's son and took out his frustrations on me in the first of gas lighting and mental abuse. This went on from when I was 5 till 17. He also mentally abused my mum and older sister but my little brother had an illness and my mum felt she had to stay for him. Only when he was older did she leave him and thus I was freed from his abuse.I also had an accident when I was 14 and fractured my hip, I could not walk on it at all for a year and could use partial weight only a year after that. That was the final straw for me and made me deeply depressed because the one place I could get away to was school and after not being there for months I felt alienated and alone. I am the end I just retreated to my room as that was the only place I had some semblance of safety left.All this is what has led to my deep rooted self hatred, low self worth, anxiety and depression. Since all of that all I have managed to do is idly spend my time retreating into games and barely really living. To top it all off the last 2 friends I had completely distanced themselves from me because of a difference of views and now I have no one but my mum and my siblings. Even my grandparents who always were there for me have dementia and cannot even remember me when they see me.I just feel so alone and that everyone will leave me one day And when they do there will be no reason left for me to live, even now I feel that it would be better if I just died now and saved the trouble of my family having to support me while I leech off their kindness. I do not want to be a burden but I feel so useless and I know how lazy I am and hate myself for it. I just do not know if there is a way out of the mess in my head and to live a life worth living.I am sorry if this has been extremely long and too much, I just wanted to say something somewhere to relieve the feeling built up inside 23(m) Just need to get how I feel off my chest as I have no one I can talk to",0

"I never thought I would be in a mental place like this. I graduated undergrad last year (2020) in the midst of COVID and made it through. I was the happiest college student ever. I had a 4.0, involved at school, inspired to start working, eager to begin a career, and adaptable when COVID disrupted my norm. I applied to graduate school and was awarded a graduate assistantship position, what a dream! It paid for my school and I got to re create my senior year that was rudely interrupted. My best friend was coming too and I got to work 20 hours a week and go to night class, something I was already used to. I started the year nervous, just like any new student does and I quickly adjusted. I made amazing friends, started going out, found my passion for marketing again through my GA position and my amazing supervisor and I had literally never been happier. Then, the year flew by and poof graduation was here and I have fallen into the deepest depression ever. I have battled with anxiety and depression and some minuscule suicidal thoughts in the past (typically when change happens) but nothing to this extreme. I was such a happy student. I love school and learning more than anything and now I do not know who I am. I do not want to get up everyday and work 8-5 (by the way fuck everyone who said it was 9-5 because its definitely 8-5). Luckily I got a job soon after graduation, negotiated a salary and am working in my career field everyone looks at me like what else could you want? I want my life back, MY life. I want to be a student, I want to be in an environment where I am comfortable and not wanting to drive off a bridge every morning I drive to work, its exhausting. I am doing the therapy thing, I am on anti depressants, but nothing works. I read suicide stories every day on reddit and listen to self-help podcasts on the way to work. I recognize my mental disorders, I am probably the most competent patient my therapist has but the depression does not care. I know I am smart, I know I am good at what I do, I know I have love and support around me, but none of it matters. I think about ways to kill myself every day. I do not want to hurt anyone that loves me, I do not want to feel this way but my brain literally cannot see the positives. The future looks like a black hole that I can never get out of. I depended so heavily on school and that environment that I do not know how to operate outside of it. I am helpless. I have the means to end it all, I am absolutely terrified of what comes next, but sometimes that does not seems as bad as living my new life the way it is. I am so fucking tired of feeling this way. imposter syndrome",1
"I am knees deep in depression. I have been trying to get better with psychiatric help, but it only made it worse. I was depressed and had panic attacks, and thanks to those meds i am now more aggressive, less caring and every day i am pushing all the people that were my friends away, just to not feel guilty that my death will destroy their lives.I have a loving girlfriend and about 7 friends i care deeply about, they are the only people that make me wait with ending it all. I am 23, nearly 24 and I cannot be an adult. I act childish, I escape into books and videogames, I failed 2 years of my colleague and I really want to pass it this year, but I do not think I am able. cannot focus, everything scares me, I need to escape, distract myself. My own head is my prison. If I do not distract myself with games or books, i keep thinking of how much of a failure I am. Walking sack of meat, wasted resources. do not know any usefull skills besides being supposedly charismatic. My loved ones told me so, but it is probably from pity. They love me but every day they must think about me not moving forward. Everyone does evolve and get better and I cannot. I just want all this to end. I need help, or I will do something they will regret. I feel like I have been cotributing nothing to their lives. I wish they stopped caring so I can off myself and finally escape this wretched place. I just cannot, I can see the few people that care about me, even though I tried to push them away. All the sadness, their staring at my dead corpse would scar them for the rest of their life, and pain and suffering would be the only thing that I left behind. Shall I wait more, until they really will stop caring? I cannot just kill myself, it would be a killing blow for them. They love me and I love them to but I am an error, taking up space. The worst thing is that I cannot tell them how I feel, they would instantly treat me like a lunatic, insane, they would treat me like a poor little hurt animal, and it is nearly as bad as just seeing me dead. It would just slowly kill me and them. I do not know, i do not know. Maybe I should just walk away from home and just see what would happen to me. Just drive as far as I can afford and then walk until i collapse. I am deeply depressed, I do not know what to do. Get better? End it all? Tell my loved ones for filthy pity and care that would case me to be even more of a burden. I do not know. Never tried to take my own life, but I really fantasy about it. Hoping I will not wake up next morning. Everyday, a disappointment in the morning. Still breathing. I am sorry for talking your time to read this. I just needed to talk. Hoped it will help a little. Sorry. I need help. I do not know what help is. Sorry. I cannot do it anymore.",1

Life is just pain. One bad thing after another. I cannot take it. I wish I did not have dreams because at least then I would not feel the pressure of having achieve them and I could just die. Hope is a burden.I have tried. A lot. With all my heart. All that spirituality and law of attraction bullshit. Nothing seems to be working. All it did was make me hate ""God"" more. I hate the world. it is so fucked up. Why should I live in a world where so many people have such amazing lives and others just have to suffer? I am so tired. I hate humans. I hate myself too, not completely but for the most part. Sorry my writing sucks I feel like shit right now. I just want to give up",1
"He asked if i wanted to fight multiple times but i never fought him because i was scared of getting a black eye or something like that, because he was bigger than me and had tattoos and was obviouslly insane. I know why i did not fight, because if i did i would be wasting time that i couls be using on work, and there would be a possibility that one of us would get really really hurt really badly, but i still feel like a huge coward for not fighting him, maybe me feeling a coward is something he projected onto me, because the look in his eyes were basically telling me that if i did not fight him i was a coward, but as mentioned above it does not mean that I am a coward if i did not fight this piece of sht, it meant that i was saving us both time, and was not letting this insane mentally ill person let his anger out on me, because he obviouslly was walking around looking for a fight, so it would be stupid of me to let him get his wish, because i obviouslly do not deserve to get hit in the face by someone for no reason at all, he basically was looking for a punching bag to let his anger out. But the thing is that he would never get rid of his anger, or maybe he would. But knowing all this i still cannot sleep at night because that situation made me completely lose control over my life, because it means that whenever someone like him will want to physically dominate me they could and would and there would be nothing i could do about it. With this thought racing in the back of my mind constantly obviouslly i cannot fall asleep, i feel hopeless and furious. The thing also is that i could find him online and talk sht to him that way, but he quit his job and left literally the next day, so i never coukd get a resolution to this situation and i never heard his name or anything like that, so that is just a person that came into my life, bullied me, and just like that left without consequences which feels depressing. I am typing this still lying in bed, I have slept only about 3 hours max i think, this is all i have been thinking about all night. Ofcourse i could workout and learn how to fight to feel more confident, but these two things show only that i have been controlled by these people into putting my time into things that i do not want to do which again is super depressing. Anyone should feel safe in this society whether or not they know how to defend themselves. This person that did this to me is a son of a bitch and is most likely laughing at me right now knowing how much he has impacted my life with such a minor thing, and how easily he can control the emotions of someone like me.

My life 1 year ago was completely different. I was such a chick magnet and everyone loved me i had so many friends and in this past year i lost everything. I have no friends so when i feel sad i do not have anyone to lean on or talk to. Being a male with depression is extremely hard bc if you speak about your feelings you are considered weak. All i want is for someone to love me even a family member but no one cares about me. It makes me feel worthless and i do not want to do this no more. I have a pistol now and every night i play with it just thinking about what would happen if i pulled the trigger. An extremely big part of me wants to die but i do not want to hurt anyone who cares about me. I have been dead inside for so long and no one seems to care but as soon as i actually die everyone will care. I seriously do not know what i did to deserve all this i do not know why I am put through this. If i could take a look into my future for 10 years and if i saw id be this way for that long i would no doubt kms. I tried a counselor but they are just someone who fake cares and they never helped me. I feel so alone and lonely it weighs me down. If only i had one friend that truly cared about me it would mean the world but no one does. What happened to me,1

"I currently have no value to anyone other than sentimental value. The love my family has for me comes only from the fact that I exist. Their lives would be no worse had I never been born. there is only one person I can say for certain I had a life changing impact on. Because of what I did, her ability to trust people will likely never be the same. My confession is in my previous posts. I also hurt my ex-girlfriend by being a constantly anxious and socially brainless fuck as well as a generally terrible boyfriend and person. I have repeatedly failed every mentor I have, and I did basically nothing in the last two years. My grades have recovered in the last semester and while I think I might still be able to live a decent life overall, I do not think I deserve it. I am a piece of shit who has stagnated in every area and I am more of a collection of vague desires to master skills that I never made any progress on despite having ample time than a person with a personality. I hurt people and wasted years, and I think I could have had a great life if I were able to rewind and undo the damage I have done and unwaste the years I have wasted. It bothers me so much that I probably could have had a great life and did great things and never had hurt people and scarred them. I do not think I deserve to live long and a decent life because I have squandered and misused the gift of life. My victim does not deserve to live a worse life just because I was a dumb horny idiot, but she probably will and I cannot stand it. She does not deserve to see how I am probably much less affected by the guilt than she is by the broken trust and trauma, she does not deserve to see how I may live a happier life than her despite her having done nothing to deserve that trauma while I am punished only with guilt far less crippling. On the other hand, my family definitely does not deserve the emotional loss from my death. I would give my mind, my body, and my future if it meant I could again be someone whose name does not bring up bad memories for people. I ended up half venting and I hope that is fine and you still read my wall of text I might still be capable of living a decent life, but I do not think I deserve to be able to live one because of the permanent damage I have caused others.",1
"Everyone I have ever known in my life has made me feel so fucking small and inferior. I never had the strength, bravery, or self-esteem to stand up to these people. And even though I am technically an adult I am fucked in my head because of all the shit people around me did to me! I cannot deal with people, I am afraid and angry with people and the world. I am sick of being weak and cowering away, but I cannot stand up to them. They continue to make me feel small and weak and that just makes me feel more worthless, more useless, and I just want to end it. My actual only hope is I get the strength to end it so I do not have to suffer, so I do not have to feel like a worthless piece of shit. Everyone has made me feel like a burden, like my existence is a problem, yet I did not ask to exist, but they blame and get mad at me.I fucking hate the world full of these fuckers who make people feel small, worthless, and in their way.

"I sold my house back in March. Its been a rough run since then. The plan was to capitalize on the increased market value with the housing market how it is. My wife and I were planning on building a house with the proceeds. It was supposed to be done in May. They built the wrong house on our land ""by accident"", made us pay more for less house. Its been months of staying with shady airbnb hosts, family, and finally an apartment we had to sign a lease on just hoping the house will be done around the time the lease expires. My car caught fire 2 months ago and the dealer is still working on reimbursing us. My grandfather is getting old and does not remember me anymore. My great uncle who I was very close to died. I had to put my dear sweet cat to sleep that I never thought id love so dearly, god I miss her. My grandmother has cancer. I cannot bring myself to talk to my disabled brother because doing so just reminds me of how neglectful I have been of him since I was younger. I started a new job months ago that I am out of the honeymoon phase of and I am really starting to wonder where my career is going from here. I do not talk to anyone anymore. I see three people on a weekly basis for four months now, two coworkers and my wife. I do not even get to play with my old gaming buddies anymore since our schedules do not work out and I cannot find any new ones due to my weird work schedule. I am so lonely.

Everytime we fight as a couple or I hear him and my mother arguing I just want to die. I have prayed so many times to just die and asked god and the devil why they just will not take me. Everytime I feel like I am finally going to kill myself i pussy out right in the last second. I know my family is going to be heartbroken but I just cannot take it anymore. The only thing I will regret if I die is that my debt will go to my husband and family. Its been 3 years spending money on different courses and products trying to start my own successful business and honestly I am ready to give up on that too but I am trying so hard to keep going because people say it takes time but its killing me. I do not have the energy and strength to keep doing everything myself. Some days I am fine and happy but then others I just do not want to leave my bedroom and just want to pass away in my sleep. Its such a battle with myself and these days I think I am leaning more towards dying that living. I always back out last minute but maybe if I just fell off a bridge or ram my car into something I will die quickly and instantly Lost between living or dying",1
"Sometimes I think about gathering all the resources I can and just disappearing. Living as long as I can homeless, and then ending it when I am out of resources and done. Disappearing",0
"Whenever the lows hit, it gets so overwhelming that I cannot handle it on my own. I turn to my best friend and boyfriend for support, but there are some things that I say in the moment about myself that I regret afterwards... I am worried that I am burdening them with my negativity... when I say these horrible things I feel like I am baiting them into a position to reassure me. I am saying those things because they are so overwhelmingly true, not for them to tell me good things about me. In the past, I have been in the position where I supported a depressed ex. My mental health was fine, but it was emotionally taxing on me. I do not want my current partner to go through this. What can I do to burden them less? How can I cope with all of my thoughts of worthlessness and not wanting to be alive? How can I be less of a burden to my loved ones?",0
"I do not understand why I feel this way. I thought I would be happy that people want to help me and uplift me but I hate it. I hate the idea of people caring for me. It always sounds like some lecture when they tell me I should stop smoking or that I should not talk about myself the way I do. I just want to be left alone.I do not care about myself. I do not have self worth. Just leave me alone and let me slowly kill myself.I am trans ftm so I was already setting myself up for this kind of depression. Especially since I have recently started testosterone injections which, if you did not know, one of the side effects includes depression. I do not even correct people on my identity anymore. Not in the work place or in public. I just sit with the discomfort and keep thinking that I will never be in a position where people will recognize me as a man. Not with the way my body is built. I do not know what to do anymore but I know I am perfectly content with slowly destroying myself. I have been lying to my friends and coworkers about smoking and treatment. it is just easier. I am so tired. I wish people would stop caring about me",0
"I know this is a petty reason to be sad, but its dragging me down pretty badly. My mind hates me. I overeat. I cannot sleep well. Some pervasive anxiety is also sprinkled in there for good measure too. But in spite of all that I have actually somehow been making good progress in terms of losing weight and getting better at running, and now all that is probably going to go out the window since I have just got shin splints and it hurts like hell to run now. It took me so much fucking effort to get to this point, forcing myself to go in spite of being so incredibly sad and tired all the fucking time and just wanting to sleep all day. I ran more regularly than I was able to fucking do laundry and now I have to break that habit in order to recover. Sure I feel sad and disgusting now since I am not able to really run but mostly it was the one good habit I was actually able to form and keep for any length of time. And now I might have to start over.. sorry I am probably being overly dramatic about this but its just been constantly there for me and its like a supports just been ripped from me Why cannot my body just listen to me",0
"If you would see me anywhere you would probably think I am happy because of my kindness and smiling and that I am handsome because I workout or whatever I do not really care, but none of it is true. None of anything is true with me. I am dying inside at almost all times and if I am around people and happy those are the times when I am most sad. Oddly enough being alone is the only thing that makes me feel better but is one of the main reasons I am in this position in the first place. Its a never ending cycle of just hating me. The voices have been winning for some time now and I can no longer control my thoughts nor where they lead and make me believe. If you ever see me (you will not) just know all that I do is to not have to burden anyone else or make anyone else even feel 1% or that they might have played a part at all. I do not want pity I do not want anything I just want to be wanted for me, and I know that is too late. I cannot fake it anymore.",0
Someone please talk to me right now I need help,1
"Throwaway because he uses reddit and knows my username. One of my friends has been severely depressed for almost a year now, and he is always been really down and stuff like that, but today he has been really happy and giving out of nowhere, it just seems weird to me i guess.should i be worried? Or is this a good sign? need some help",0
"Me - 24M My Partner 29F I have undiagnosed anxiety - at least I think I do. Whatever it is, its taken a toll and ruined most of the romantic relationships I have been in. And its rearing its ugly head again, or I am. (I am trying not to place the blame on the anxiety, I need to own it)I have been obsessively checking my partners location using Find My - even when I know where she is (work, home, sisters, etc) It occurred to me recently, What would I do if she was not where she said she was? It always worries me when she (or my past partners) would go out for the night to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. I get this overwhelming feeling that they are going to find someone better, bring them home and be unfaithful; just the thought of it makes my stomach turn. I want to be able to tell myself that is not likely and get out of my own head but Its all I can think about. It does not help that my current partner is Bipolar 2 and has manic episodes where her sex drive is elevated - that scares me even more. What if she needs to scratch that itch and I am not around? What if she is mad at me and does it to get back at me? What if this? What if that? Its a deep rabbit hole. To pile on the crap, she works retail and I have an office job so there is several hours every night that I try to keep myself busy and not imagine her sneaking off from work to be with someone else. Speaking of work, she is fairly new at this job in a management position and they are already talking about moving her to a new store possibly out of state as the next step career wise. Now this is not for a few years but I have got obligations here that make it more challenging for me to pack up and move to a new state if that is what happens. She, she just has me and lately its felt like she would be willing to drop me like a sack of potatoes should the offer come up.Its been a recurring argument; we never have time for just us you are always on about workJust be present with me they call you in every day, even on your days off its taxing to say the least. We talked recently and it came up that our priorities are out of order Hers are: 1. Her career 2. My Career 3. Our relationship Mine are: 1. Our relationship 2. Our careers It just feels like she is not willing to compromise at all. I have asked her multiple times if she would be willing to but its always I do not know what my plan is yet I do not want her to give up her future for me but I do not want to be considered when she thinks about her future, that does not seem crazy, right? The icing on the cake is I have developed a little bit of a weed addiction. Problem is - I work for Uncle Sam. And also, I act like such a child when I am high. I try not to I try to be chill like everyone else but when I am high is the only time I feel like I can not worry about everything else.So yeah I act like a child when I am high because the rest of the time I have to hold everything together and its this sweet sweet release from that. I do not know what the point of this rant is - is it a confession, is it a rant, I just want to be heard, validated maybe. What does it look like from the outside?Ask questions for clarification if you want. I feel like my anxiety is ruining my life",0
How to control my mind? I was afraid when cook and see knife. My mind keep telling me to suicide . Tried to doing anything to distract my mind but did not work. My mind mess up,1
"I do not know where else to post this. I really considered it a month or so ago, I almost did it, then I said fuck it and passed out drunk and went to work like it never happened.I guess I have been thinking like, life is meaningless, so why not embrace it? I hate the circumstances I have been born into, would not suicide be defeatist and playing the victim when I can reclaim every horrible thing I have been through and live through it and help others? Yet it still crosses my mind, and I find comfort the option exists. So idk what this means or if anyone could relate. I am just so confused",1

my future looks bleak and my entire life has been a sick joke and right now i am in so much pain. all I am good at is self harming and pushing people away and suppressing my emotions. i need help but I am irreparably fucked up. i only feel good when i hurt myself really badly self destruct until i die,1
"So excited to get this going. I have been trying to get my psychologist to refer me but he kept wanting to try different meds (which I understand). But, finally I have a shot. A shot at not being miserable 24/7. I really hope ECT helps somewhat. Positive vibes only, I am sure it will work :) Got a referral for ECT!!",0
"I have been very ""brave"" lately about taking action, but fear has been consuming me in a way that I have been doing nothing for days. I gave up my job, I am thinking about dropping out of college (this will happen at some point) and I am always looking blank at nothing, I cannot project a future and I cannot change my present because I feel it would not be ideal for myself by starting a cycle of ""I look good, I look bad"" when I am always bad. That said, would clinical support through a psychologist or psychiatrist help me and project my future life? I have never been to a specialist because the consultation is very expensive and the consultations that the state offers are for more serious cases, so I want to know if it will be something that can help me or if it will just be another person saying that I need to cheer up and win this bad phase, but in a more technical way. Will clinical support help me live or will it be a temporary solution?",1

"I have spent the last 3 to 4 years in therapy and it has done nothing to help me. I finally went to the doctor about a few issues and spoke on depression/anxiety. She gave me the typical screening and I of course failed the exam. She asked me how I felt and also said that I do have panic attacks which felt so freeing to know what I was feeling was not all in my head. I knew I had depression and anxiety but the heart palpitations really are annoying and make me nervous as they go on.I am still really nervous about it, has anyone had similar problems with medicine? I am going to be starting depression/anxiety medication.",0
I have lived with depression since 2012 or 2013. I do not know how to be happy anymore. I get depressed when good things happen to me and I feel relieved when shitty things happen to me because that is how my mind thought shit would turn out.I am too scared to be honest. I am too scared. Scared of happiness because one has to know what being sad/mad/bad is in order to be happy.Missed my Senior Prom/Matric Farewell because I think everyone would have laughed at me. I also thought going would have made me happy which means it could also make me sad...so I did not risk it.Was invited to a video shoot; I helped out a lot so that I had an excuse not to be in front of the camera because other people might see me being happy which scares me as well. I get invited to clubs and ish and I stay at home because I am scared of being disappointed... especially when people want to pay for meI really fucked up and I lost my virginity to hookers/prostitutes When I was about 16. Till today I have only had sex with hookers and prostitutes. I think it is fair to say I do not deserve a loving relationship.I got a porn addiction. Hookers and Porn mean I cannot love myself mentally anymore. Meaning any woman with self respect and morals and decency makes me scared and I cannot talk to them. Especially when they come to me.What the actual fuck should I do? What the actual fuck is the punchline to the joke that is my life cannot be happy even when there is no reason to be sad,0

Inhale and exhale. You know sometimes its good to just remember what went right. I was born in America into a upper middle class family. At least I was not born in Honduras or the slums of Brazil.I should learn to be more grateful for other things in my life. I am so overwhelmed with self hate that I am blinded to my other privileges. I will sleep now and think about this further Deep breaths,1
"I am 18 yrs old and since 2018 suicide never really left my head To begin with when I went to high-school I lost a lot of friends due to the fact that I went to school far from the city I grew up.i ended up with no friends.in high-school my mother was the headmistress of the school so I never really knew if my classmates really wanted me as a friend or they wanted just because of the position of my mother.So I was 5/7 days of the weekend in that village my school was and the rest of the days I was with my father(my parents are divorced) I genuinely preferred him than my mother.I also had some bullies in the school .I never talked about them on the first year.So I got used to it and I did nothing.At least I had 2 new genuine friends.I really enjoyed spending time with them but to tell you the truth I never really liked that village as a place.Anyway at the end of the year I met an old friend and we started hanging out.That summer my friend from the school came to the city I live and we decided to hung all together.The same day when we were out i reconnected with 4 old friends.And we all connected(except the guy from my school)So 2 became 5 etc.At this point i was really happy and positive.2nd year of high-school began I had 2 friends in school and 5 friends in town.P.s my mother after the divorce had an affair but the 2nd year this guy went to live in France he was actually a good guy to me and to my mother he was more of a friend to me than a step-father and I did not really bother but when he left,my mother started an affair with his brother ffs. He was kind of okay but sometimes when my mum got angry with me(as always,there are many stuff that my mother did to me and my brother not all bad but that is for another story)he would play the father role to me and I hated it. I wanted to leave my mum to live her life without me, I do not know if I was a good son or a bad son. I tried to leave her alone(I eventually did this year and its painful for a mother) and I was thinking how she would take it.Thankfully covid-19 appeared(sorry for saying this)and I did not have to live in that place.I even held on better on my subjects.As you see i have not mentioned at all my love life in the story that is because I did not really have one as I avoided to make a relationship in that place cuz I hated it and I wanted to be far far away from it, its not that I could not make a relationship, as I rejected two girls not only because of the place but also due to my high standards(mostly the place though) On summer of the 2nd year one of my friends introduced me to a female friend of his.At first I did not really noticed her but when we met for a second time due to my lack of social skills she would make the talk andshe talked to me she was staring at me smiling and then I thought that she was just perfect. The next days I would always find ways just to meet. I felt like she was flirting with me as we were in a library and she placed sth with flowers on my head and she smiled then she placed it on her and I told her that she looks nice with it and she smiled again. She would ""randomly"" touch me i never found the courage to touch her in return.Anyway that was a nice moment for me but it ended up on rejection it was my 1st rejection as I never made the 1st move I have made only 3 relationships 1 rejection and I have rejected 5 girls(sometimes I would reject some girls because I was afraid)In 3rd year nothing happend due to covid-19 i did not have to go to that place and I even had more time to hang out with friends. At the end of that season(now) i had exams as well. I was not the best student even though my mother made it seem like I was . I never accepted it I did not want this to happen I did not want to give more reasons for my classmates to hate me. I did not even attend to my graduation ceremony because of this.So we come here to this day where I have my marks from my exams (these exams in my country are the key to a successful life) i have some options with the marks i got and I can get into a nice university.Problem is that in my love life I do not know what to do I.I do not know if I am ugly or sth but this year I find it really difficult to find love or even make new friends I feel awkward in the crowd I also I am scared of eye contact I do not know why I just cannot keep eye contact with someone over 5 seconds when I am in a crowded place I do not know where to look.I feel like I am such a weird kid.Even when something good is happening to me sth bad is getting it down. And that is when I felt like I do not want feel anything anymore shyness,awkwardness,abandoned.I have always planned to die without much pain i found a building that is very tall its the tallest building in my town but its a university and I do not want anyone to watch me dead and leave a traumatizing experience for him I also do not want my parents to feel like they failed. I just want for everyone to live their lives without bothering I ever existed I do not know if I ever do it but I am feeling really close I would give everything for a painless death",1
"I am fine with life being temporary. I am very comfortable with that idea, but I am not comfortable with the idea that most of my relationships will not last more than a few years, and Ill be in a perpetual cycle of meet new ppl -&gt; something happens -&gt; bye -&gt; meet new ppl, and ignore the trauma from that constant insecurity and instead tell myself that is how its meant to be forever. I am young so maybe that will change over time, I do not know but right now it feels hopeless Relationships are as temporary as employment",0
i do not understand why do ppl choose to live?,1
"they are really cool and I am literally so alone and I feel like I have to, I cannot just keep sitting here and hoping I die, I also cannot just die and I cannot just cut again. This is stupid and life is stupid and I do not want it. And I cannot really talk about this to people I know, I wrote a message reaching out to my friends and it is sitting there unsent. I do not even want to eat. I have a binge eating issue and I have not been eating or feeding myself all week, which is really weird. I think I am really like giving up lol. I have health anxiety and there are a few things going on and I wish they would just take me out but they are like not deadly or anythingI'm so hungry and nothing.... nothing is something I want to eat, I do not want anything. I feel like someone I really trust is walking all over me and I cannot do anything about itIs this life?? Why?? Fuck, I do not want it. The skin on my fingers are all bitten off at this point, I do not care. I might care in the morning but I do not right now. I am not even in my mid twenties yet and I want to fucking die. Is not eating some sort of silent protest? it is stupid because no one knows but me. God I just do not want this, it is all pain, all of it. And I am going to yell into the void about it Finally reaching out and texting the trevor project again",1
I want so bad for something to go right. A happy life with friends and people who love me. Sometimes things are so unbelievably terrible that I start to wonder if religion is real and I died and went to hell. I think it would be something like being alone. I have not even seen a familiar face in over a month. Loneliness is killing me and nobody wants someone broken anymore. Things have so bad throughout my life that I am starting to wonder if I was a terrible person in my past life and this one is punishment. I do not even believe in past lives.,0
"I (21 M) . Last year since the lockdown started my life was litrally the same as it was before lockdown! it was then I realised how anti social amd how lonely I was. and due to some issues and stupid things I did in the past my depression was extreme that i really wished to get corona and die , I lost the will to live ..but after a year of staying inside house and realising how loving great family and blessings I have my depression litrally became worse because there are people in the worst of worst conditions living happily and I cannot be like that even though I am previleged I feel like I do not deserve all this blessings and i am a total loser. the depression is getting better but I still do not have the will to live, no matter how hard i try i really do not want to proceed with life... when i see accident victims and soldiers suffering to survive i really wonder how do they have such will to live ? Had it been me i would have happily accepted death with both hands! Seriously how to gain the will to live? How to gain the will to live?",0

"So, I have a teenage brother who does not act his age but he is not sped or anything. I am about to turn 20 and he still wants to sleep with me. I feel uncomfortable sleeping with him (we both have our own beds) and I am in my mom's room since I am babysitting and he wants to sleep with me. I told him, you are not a little boy, go sleep in your room. I was told my depression was quite high and I tend to overreact sometimes but I just cannot control how I feel. I started crying from being upset and he still would not budge. My grandma said why I am so against it and I told her ""He mocks my depression every single time. You think I will feel comfortable sleeping with someone who mocks my depression?"" that is when both my grandma and aunt said ""it is all in your head. Control your feelings. it is just a minor thing, no need to overreact""I KNOW I am OVERREACTING BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING I CAN CONTROL. THEM SAYING ""ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD"" MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT they are DISMISSING MY DEPRESSION AS SOMETHING SMALL. I FEEL REALLY HURT. I KNOW I ACT CHILDISH BUT I JUST cannot CONTROL MY FEELINGS. IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE FOR ME TO COME OUT TO SAY ""I HAVE DEPRESSION"" but i regret I ever did. They do not take my depression well. I attempted an overdose but they do not change their behavior towards me. Why did I ever decide to trust them?? All I ever wanted from them was to say they love me and that they will support me and take my depression seriously. Why is it that I feel that my doctor cares more than my family?? I really needed to rant so thank you guys for reading ""it is all in your head""",0

"I have struggled with depression for almost 20 years. Now it feels different. It feels stronger, it feels darker. I can see my reflection in the mirror but I do not know who I am. Who was I before? Am I even any different? Sleep used to be my escape from myself but my dreams are vivid and awful now. The anxiety has crept into my unconscious. I am alone inside of myself. I have been taking lamictal for 15 years and recently I have gone without them for a few weeks due to unfortunate circumstances. I know I am experiencing withdrawal from them. My mind is foggy and distracted. I cannot concentrate on even a television show I enjoy. The things that used to soothe me are no longer working. Every day is the same as the last in my mind. I tried to quit smoking cigarettes...but I cannot seem to let go of them. My therapist has me confused and scared about what could be wrong with me mentally. I have broken up with a very close friend because they accused me of being selfish and toxic. Maybe I am. But I am just trying to survive. I do not want to die. I just want to be okay. I cannot work. My finances are being taken care of by my 60 year old mother who works overtime to support me through this. I am forever grateful for her sacrifice. The shame of not being able to support myself as an adult is weighing heavy on my self worth and esteem. I am in a very dark place and I am afraid. Sometimes I lay in bed and think about all the people in the world and how a lot of them feel lost or scared or just empty like me. How can I be on this planet with so many people and feel completely isolated. My friends love me. My family loves me. My boyfriend loves me. I know this. But it does not cure me. I am my own enemy. My mind is a prison and I silently scream internally every day. how is that for dramatic? I cannot find the words to express myself",0
I want to cut myself so bad. I want to stab my eye. I want cut my arms up. I want to cut off my penis. I want to feel pain. I feel like I am falling back into how I felt a few months ago. I want other things more than I want to die but death is so much easier. I would not fail to kill myself if I tried. I can easily kill myself. Its tempting. Nobody can stop me. I want to fucking burn. I feel real bad,1
"I am diagnosed with depression (2016) (I am in therapy for it) and currently struggle with a couple symptoms of depression that freak me out because I do not feel depressed and or sad. I have anxiety as well. My symptoms are fatigue and dizziness basically constantly. My blood Is fine tho.

"I have hit another low point in life again and i now have to start taking my antidepressants again after I quit since Jan this year. I forgot how the side effects always kick in hardest when you first start it. I have not slept for the past 2 days at all, feeling hungry and restless and I am so fucking tired. I am a student too, and it makes it so hard for me to focus on work (both at home and in school)I just wished I did not let myself get to this state again. I wish that I could have realised earlier that I had only been coping with my issues, not healing from them :/ restarting on antidepressants again and it sucks",0
"All I hear is ""Think of who you hurt!"" Oh yeah? What if everyone in my life is an abusive, selfish piece of trash and I have no prospects outside of my crypto going 10x in value? that is all I have. Money. But will it fix this black space where there should be loving people. And before you judge and think I am not a good person to be friends with, I am. I have been an amazing person to my friends but there is just something about me that repels people. I cannot help it. No matter how much I buy people, or fix their mental health, or get them on the right supplements and in the right investments.. I get dumped like I am nothing. NOTHING. Why would I want to hurt them all? I want them to hurt. I want them to know how much damage they inflicted on me. I want them to change. My death will be the catalyst to others changing their abusive and selfish behaviour. Why are people so cruel to those who help them?",1

"Hi, first time writing here. I am an 18 yo girl and its been a month, maybe more, since I have noticed these things. During this period I have not been myself. The main thing I am noticing is that I have been really numb to everything; I often find myself wanting to feel something, like sadness, but not being able to. Its like I am indifferent to everything. In addition, before summer came, I used to work out and read everyday, but I cannot find the energy to do these things anymore, even if I love them. The only time I feel better is when I go out of the house. When I am home, everything feels boring and I do not know what to do. I do not know how to explain this feeling, I feel completely hopeless towards life, like every thing I currently look forward to is eventually going to pass and there is actually nothing to be excited for. For example, when I am feeling excited for an upcoming event, I sometimes find myself thinking ""and after that?"", feeling like I am stuck in this loop where every moment of happiness is temporary.I do not know if this is useful, but I think i need to say that I also have some anxiety attacks sometimes, even if they are pretty rare. The reason why I am deciding to take this seriously is because its been a long time since I have noticed these patterns, and I am usually able to ""get back on track"" quickly. The last thing I want to do is self diagnose myself, but I do not know how to talk to a professional, I am scared that I am imagining this and I also do not know what would I say to my parents since they do not really believe in these things. Could this be depression? Are these symptoms of depression?",0
She does not care about me so there is nothing left to lose. Tomorrow's the day fellas,1
just reached another milestone in my life (got my first full-time job) and there is not a part of me that is happy just like when i found out i got into university or when i finally graduated i thought antidepressants were supposed to make me feel more like a human what went wrong? will anything ever make me happy?,0
"I have very sever (diagnosed) OCD. My psychiatrist does not like labels so she does not even tell me if what I am feeling is because of depression. Basically, I fear seeing/guessing coincidences. I am mad scared that they might make me believe that they were somehow signs. I have had many coincidence happening to me where I thought for example beforehand: ""If I see a car with XXXX license plate it means I am in hell"". And It happened. I know it is probably bullshit, but my brain internalized the fear of ""being in hell"" now and for over 9 months I have been feeling really sad and empty. Like even in nature where I usually used to feel well and happy, I now feel really down and I remember the ""what if I am in hell or what if God is evil"" and then I become even worse. I cannot be happy anymore. My cat died and I did not even felt sad, I feel a helpless void because of this thing that happened with the license plates. it is ridiculous, but it is how I feel everyday.

"I am sure I will get ""you are too young to be posting here"" or something like that but I have not been feeling great for a long time now. I do not exactly have no friends but I am nobody's beat friend. I feel as if I am just there and nobody cares about me. Nobody talks to me. Also, school is too painful for me, it is just an 8 hour day of stress, sadness and suffering. I am doing horribly in school and feel as if my life will go to crap at 18 or something worse could happen before then. Ever since I went to secondary school, I feel as if I lost everyone that actually cared about me from primary school. I no longer have the energy to do what I want, I do not eat enough, barely get any sleep and just feel sad all the time. I stress way too much and I recently lost a friend because they did not believe that I was depressed. I am not sure about anything anymore. Sometimes I feel like I should jump in front of a car, would probably make everyone is lifes easier. Obviously this probably is not too big of a deal and I am just overthinking it but I am not sure. 1st time posting here and already feel nervous to press post.

"Have severe depression. Had therapy friday and left feeling more hopeful, wanting to get better after a terrible week of being bedridden due to depression. Was even able to do dishes. But it all got ruined really fast. I told a friend I would not be able to play RPGs with him due to my condition, he was all offended and made it all about himself. I got negative feedback for my MA work and now I just feel worthless again. I know I should be happy I am still being able to study while feeling so horrible but it just makes me feel worse. I put all this effort into trying to keep my friends, my academic career, but I feel it is all for nothing. The desire to give up just gets stronger every day and I am getting worse. I lost so many people, family, friends, to COVID and even my dog died of cancer last year, I wish I still had something to cling onto but it all feels so pointless.I would be very thankful if anyone had some idea on how to let the negative things affect me less or just a word of sympathy. I do not know if it is the depression but everyone just seems so negative, like they just think I am lazy or taking too long to recover. I used to want to get better so much but now I just want to give up. Feel like my progress is worthless",0
We have been together since high school and recently thing have been really tough between us. He has suffered with depression for years but has never actively tried to get professional help for it no matter how much I encourage him. Lately we have been bickering and butting heads very frequently so we have decided to take some space apart whilst he works on himself. The partner he is to me at the moment I really do not like. I want someone who will show me love and affection and I feel like he does not have the mental energy to do that for me lately. He does not even seem remotely grateful that I have stuck by him and loved and supported him throughout. I asked him to give me some reassurance like at least be like I love you and I am working on things to be better for you but he said he does not feel that way so he does not want to lie. I do not know if this relationship is just pointless or if I should be patient and support him through this too but I am tired. I feel like he takes advantage of me being there and does not appreciate me but then am I asking for a lot for someone who is suffering from depression? My [F26] boyfriend [27M] asked for a break from our relationship to work on himself,0
"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go. And they can all finally live their lives. I wish I was not such a narc so I could just find peace in death",1

This made me feel even worse and has coloured everyone is day, and I refused to eat with the rest of my family at dinner. I am feeling a little better now, which makes me wonder if I ever actually felt that bad or if I was just being a lazy asshole?

Tried 4 times. Did permanent damage but even failed at killing myself. My life just keeps getting worse no matter how hard I try. I have a rare genetic illness that makes me extremely sensitive to drugs and alcohol. I figure maybe I can slowly kill myself by just drinking or something. it will be slower than I want but faster than others because of this illnesses. Idk shit about drugs and alcohol though. Just want to die. I am done. Please :( 28. Never done drugs or drank. Might start because I apparently cannot even kill myself right.,1

The road to my current mental health state started years ago with the first domino of my uncle killing himself. Now I feel stuck because I want to die but I cannot do the same thing to my niece and nephew that my uncle did to me. If he did not kill himself first I might not be suicidal in the first place or I would be free to do it without fully understanding the consequences. In reality tho now all I want to do is end it but I cannot because I know what it would do to my loved ones because it happened to me. I do not know which is worse and just want to stop spiraling. I resent my Uncle for showing me the aftermath of suicide.,1
"This month has been pretty hard. But I will take it one day at a time I guess. Writing things down helps to some extent especially if I talk to my psychologist about it. But man when things get too much, I feel as if I cannot write things down. My mind starts racing at all the bad things but then connects it to past experiences. Positive and/or negative. Or I will just completely freeze up or forget about it. Even writing this is difficult. Or I will convince myself things will get better and I should not write that down since I have got bigger problems I would like to discuss. Or it is not that big a deal which it does not need to be.

"The only question I am left with in this shit hole of a world is 'Why Stay Here?'Watching the last 18 months where the idiot masses delight in the destruction of any remaining freedom that they had. I do not want to live in a world where the government gets to threaten you for the basic freedom of leaving one's house, where the government thinks it has the right to monitor one's every movement, to place on under house arrest on a whim, where the media supports the growing Orwellian State and attacks anyone who cares about basic freedoms as ""selfish.""Existing in this stifling world of control, coercion, mass governmental intimidation, endless fear based propaganda to traumatise and psychologically abuse people.The only question that remains is why stay in this shit hole amongst the braying masses that celebrate as the State gains more and more control over them. Every time the State gets this much control, the end is a fucking disaster. The history of man has been the few trying to gain freedom from the State and the state-worship of the cultist masses. Be it on the left or the right - fascism or communism - same shit, different colour flag.What kind of evil fuckhead would come up with a system that functions like this world does. Sure there are nice views, and a few people left who value freedom over centralised authoritarian control systems, but they are far between. Sure, there are some nice views, but nature is a lying whore who beautiful costume is a deception on top of her uncaring cruelty. If leaving this place was not so brutal, and if one had not been programmed from birth to view carrying on regardless, or that life is somehow worth it, then what sane man would continue?If there is a Creator, and I suspect there is, then I hate this evil moron. And if one tries to discuss these things, one is just told meaningless platitudes. Why is this, because this place is such a shit hole, that all one can find to offer the one contemplating these things is meaningless platitudes.I wake up each morning to the endless Covid propaganda, threats from the government and its propagandists, endless coercion and intimidation from a police state that believes it can falsely imprison millions of people just cos its experts (priest class) says so.What sane man would want to live in such a world? And to top it all off, whatever is behind this world programmed me with a body that cowers in fear at the thought of the pain and suffering requires, it made me sympathetic to my fellow man so I dread to because more suffering to the ones that remain.But what kind of reason is this to carry on? I must remain a slave to materiality, and criminal fascist governments that want to control when I can leave my house, and monitor all my movements, and then lie to me that it is for my own safety and that or others, which is classic Narcissitic abuse?And then watch the masses defend their abusers like good little Stockholm syndrome slaves?What a pathetic realm this is, what a pathetic creator must be behind it, and what pathetic &amp; servile creatures I am surround with. Who would give up their children's freedoms cos they are scared.And what a pathetic creature I am, that can see there is no sane nor rational reason to remain here, but am too scared to end it, too servile to my programmed bodily desire to survive.What kind of world has to put up such sentinels against leaving it? And why do I stay here and not depart? Cos some fuckhead gave me a stupid material body that has chemical factories inside it, that release drugs to create emotional states that keep me in this prison world. And then people advise to to go and get help. What, from some therapist who was probably trained by the state my enemy, who probably supports the covid bullshit, who supports one of the most brutal attack on the health of mankind (both mental and physical) ever launched in the name of hypochondria and germophobia.Whilst there was a semblance of freedom to this place is what bearable, but no one with a functioning soul can endure this level of constraint. I only hope that either I can conquer this fear, not of death by of dying, or that my natural end is not far off anyway. Why Stay Here?",1
Thought it could not get any worse. It could. Life's a bitch and then you get cancer,1
I have (F16) questioning this for awhile after my most recent productive period. i realized that maybe around a month ago i felt that i genuinely and i mean it nearly cured my social anxiety and was on the brink of recovering from my depression. this period of happiness lasted like at least a week for sure and more. i was soo productive i ran everyday in which i never do and i was even artistic and made a full drawing that i framed later. i felt so good and like i was not going to feel the loneliness of depression but this time sadly ended. i do not know why and i realized that I have felt this way before. prior i had another time period where i was super creative and decorative i decorated a full wall on my room and took time to make this spirited away painting. i was just so artistic but for some reason after i fell into this hole of anger and slept so much and rarely got out of bed. i even ended up destroying and cutting that painting i spent hours on and i broke things in my room.i do not know why i got like that but that sense of irritation/irritability followed me after my most recent high of my depression.i do not know if i should bring this up to my pediatrician or not. i also currently take wellbutrin XL 300mg which worked at first but I have been on it for so long its hard to distinguish if it works well still. questioning if my MDD is actually bipolar disorder,0
"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK. Any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated. My (M21) friend (F21) has been planning to k*ll herself next week and I do not know what to do",1

"I am cross-posting this to the depression sub-reddit from the bipolar one as I feel like it would be helpful to get the input from people on both sides!TW: self harmHey, I am really hoping that someone here can help me. I know diagnosing is not allowed in this sub, but just hoping that someone who has been diagnosed can tell me if it is something that sounds similar to what they experience, and if so I plan on going to the doctor. Hoping this is not too long! Thank you in advance for reading.I was diagnosed with depression 5 or 6 years ago when I was 19 (now 24), and I have never actually doubted that - until recently. I am not sure the best way to go about this so I am just going to list the reasons why I think I might be bipolar (based on symptoms that I have found out by googling).1. The best way to describe myself and my mental state at any time is that I have two halves of me - the ""good"" half, and the ""bad"" half. When I am in my ""good"" half, I cannot imagine what it is like to be in the ""bad"" half, and vice versa.2. The switches between these two halves can be very sudden. Last week, I felt suicidal and the most depressed I would felt in a very long time. I self harmed 7 times in one day. My therapist asked me if I had been able to process the emotions I was feeling last week and I literally could not even imagine them. I feel optimistic about the future, I feel more energised, I actually enjoy doing my hobbies. I always thought this was normal for depression...3. Whenever I have good days with my depression, they are ALWAYS followed by even worse days. It got to the point that I actually hate feeling happy because I know that I am going to feel even worse after it, and it does not seem worth it. During those happy days, I am sociable, I chat to people a lot, I enjoy going about my life and being busy. I feel confident that I am good at my work, I know why I was given this position. During the depressed days after, I struggle to even get out of bed, I cancel hanging out with people, I sit and scroll on my phone, cannot be bothered to do anything (I am addicted to caffeine and I cannot even make myself go and get coffee - I will just let the withdrawal symptoms happen), I wear my comfort clothes (like my blanket jumper and pjs).4. My mood can switch in an instance. The other day, I was having a breakdown, hated myself, could not get up and I could not stop crying. Literally a minute later, I stopped crying, felt happy and able to be productive. Got up, went and made myself a drink, tidied the house, did the dishes...5. I often fluctuate with how much I want to see other people - there are times I love hanging out with friends, meeting new people, hanging out with colleagues... others, I just want to stay home with my husband and dog, close the curtains and shut out the world.6. I often flip from feeling happy and content to insanely frustrated for incredibly minor reasons where my whole body feels ridiculously tense and I snap at people a lot, then get really confused why I am so irritable - normally happens after a good day where I have felt fairly ""normal"" and happy.7. Speaking of normal, this is something I do not really understand. I do not ever have ""normal"" periods, my ""normal"" is that I do not feel anything, I struggle to do work and my seemingly stable mental state is very precarious, it takes very little to knock it back to depressed again.I feel like this makes no sense, but I am hoping that someone can read it and understand. I am currently taking an antidepressant (sertraline) and it does not seem like it is doing anything for me. I have tried other antidepressants but none that work.Please someone help... do not know if I am bipolar or just depressed",0

My son had been diagnosed with a terminal cancer and passed away just 2 weeks later. I was also going thru a divorce at the time. My ""husband"", despite being my son's step-father and knowing my son since the age of 2, rarely visited us in the hospital and attempted to make me feel guilty on the occasions he did. I was also fired from my job, despite being a full-time employee for several years and requesting time off in advance. (that is, uh, service Industry for ya, I guess)Despite being homeless, jobless and grieving, I was determined to soldier on, so I found an apartment and lived in hermit-ude for another year and a half. In spite of a sketch boyfriend and an even sketchier ex-husband trying to worm his way back into my bed, I somehow managed to find a job and some emotional stability and even had another child!Things were kind of swell for a bit until.....they just were not. I was stuck at home all the time. The house was always ""under construction"" and I could not spend time with my friends.it is not one big thing, it is allllll the little things. I cannot tolerate living like this anymore. Everything is disorganized and chaotic. I do not have the energy to clean and even if I did, it would only make me anxious, as the entire house is a construction zone that we just so happen to live in. there is no exit strategy or end game, it is just my partner, subbing out jobs a couple of times a year to sketchass dudes who show up whenever, for the past 4yrs. Everything is covered in some type of tile dust or trim dust or plywood dust or sheetrock dust and I am apparently allergic to all of it. I take Zyrtek, Allegra, hydrozene and Benadryl daily. I feel worthless. there is no further benefit to my existence on this planet. Can I please rest now? I Lost My Child",1
"Every day I just want to go back to bed, nothing has been cheering me, I have played videogames for so many hours that I am started to get sick of it. it is hard for me to enjoy things, I just go auto pilot mode, and the moment I do enjoy just vanish in my mind. It feels like I just was not born to be happy for more than an hour, and I feel like the medication is just a way of lying to myself and I feel like I do not deserve it. I am just average right? I just want to sleep my depression out",0
"This is what society has reinforced in everyone. If you do not have money or looks nobody gives a shit about you, that is the truth. what is the point in living if you are treated as a subhuman second class individual for your whole existence? unattractive and/or poor people have no value",0
"So a few friends have told me that I have got depression and I do not want to go off of a self-diagnosis or what somebody that is not professional says. So December 30th of 2020 while I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep a feeling of loneliness and sadness came over me is the best way I could describe it and I figured by the time I wake up it would be gone, when I woke up the next morning I still felt that way and decided to get ready in the dark and on my drive up to work I did not have the radio on listening to music like I normally would, when I got to work I asked my boss which route I would be doing and I started typing in the addresses on my phone and whenever I type address is in I use voice dictation, so every time I would speak an address in that morning I kept feeling this urge like I wanted to cry and the more I kept speaking the stronger it got so eventually I started typing them in with my finger and several times before dispatch my manager walked past me and I wanted to tell him so bad that I was not feeling well mentally and that I was not all there I was so close to telling him yet I could not bring myself to do it so finally fast forward to after they dispatch us instead of telling my manager that I am not feeling well mentally I told him that I was hungover..... I felt like I would have been judged if I would have told him that I was not feeling all there mentallyAnd one more incident here recently happened where me and a friend went to a bar and on our way over there I kind of get this familiar feeling of like loneliness and sadness and when we get into the bar and sit down they ask what we want to eat and drink and I was not in the mood for anything so I did not order anything I pretty much just stared off into space while we were there and after we left the bar we walked around the little shopping center area that it was in and then before we got back to my truck there was a park nearby with two Bridges that cross over a trail so I told my buddy that I was going to go take a piss and I would be right back I walk in between the two Bridges and sit down on the embankment or whatever the hell you call that thing and then I cried for about 5 to 10 minutes for absolutely no reason whatever And the background I would say the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020 I had made plans to go play pool with a coworker and right before I got to the pool hall they Called said that they could not go so I ended up going by myself and stayed there until about 2:00 a.m. playing pool by myself realizing that I was getting more and more lonely I decided to leave and drive to the park on the way there the feeling got stronger and when I got to the park I shut my truck off and cried for about a good 5 minutes at least and texted one of my co-workers that he was better at his job than I was at mineI honestly do not know if I am depressed or just lonely, because that feeling is not always constant, it is not always persistent 24/7 I think I might have depression",0
I worked alone. Office of ONE for years. It ate at me. It made me depressed. I sought help. I felt better I got a new job. After 2 months they just announced ever person in my office is moving location except me. Leaving me alone again. I had made friends. I am sad. I was thinking about self harm again. I hate this and everything about it. Why cannot I find a normal job with normal relationships. Right back to being alone at work.,0
my ex told ME she wanted to get back together and I got excited to finally be with her again. she constantly just does not respond to my messages for 5+ hours at a time and today she just causally dropped that she got an std (considering I am still a virgin it obv was not from me). when asked her why she cheated on me her response was not everything is fucking about you. how can people just completely change that quickly? she was the only thing keeping me sane when I have been really stressed out recently and I am already really insecure about being 20 and not having sex yet so she knows exactly how awful it made me feel. It just makes me feel ugly and worthless. I am going to make sure once I actually do it that its painful because I apparently deserve it. girlfriend cheated on me. tried to make herself the victim. I am out of any reason to live.,1
"I am 23 M - I am behind in my studies and am currently just lazing out at home on my dad's money. Just now my mom came and she shouted at me with tears and anger, saying.. How she is heartly praying for her own death because of me. How I am wasting my dad's hard earned money, how I do not even care about his health. How useless and ungrateful son I am to her and many such things. I only listened to her, stayed quite. Holding out my panic attack in front of her. I know how she feels, I am aware that I am a failure and unworthy person. I really blame myself every day, regarding all that she spoke of. I know what she said is all true. I am the worst kid any parents could ever have. I feel extremely guilty and like every other day I wish that I was never born. I know instead of whining here like this I should actually do something productive. I am totally aware of that. I truly despise myself from the bottom of my heart. I do not know what and how I should feel. My mom just slept crying. I am completely lost. I Deserve every amount of pain I can get.",0
"everything is ready, I have what I would need to do it, I have all my notes written out, I have a will written out but its not legal, I have every detail planned except a date. All I know is that it will be ready when I have the guts to do it. I just do not want to leave my pets, they would not understand why I suddenly left them. My family, friends and boyfriend would at least understand why I did it. They could get past it and honestly I am at the point where I do not even think they would be shocked or terribly upset, they all know its eventually going to happen. I have tried everything, you name it, I have tried it, nothing seems to help anymore. I wish I ended it before it got worse but each time i attempted, I either ended up in the hospital, or in some way recovering. I do not want to fuck up and become a vegetable though, overdosing never worked, the first time i threw up and the second time with pills i had to get my stomach pumped. This will be my sixth and final attempt (aside from times I chickened out.) and if all goes smoothly, no one that i know personally would have to see my body. I was diagnosed at a very young age and i guess I have reached a point where i do not have the energy to keep trying I have all of it planned but no date",1

"I have posted here before. I have been suicidal for awhile now. I just wanted to let my supports know your amazing and everything you have done for me is up and beyond. I wanted to let my loved ones know that I am always there. Even though I have gone missing.. I am gone. Please forgive me for the choices I have made. I love you all so much and hope this finds you. To anyone who thinks they could have prevented this I am so sorry but this is my only choice. I would not trade my family for anything and I love you so much. To my boyfriend: I am sorry I snuck away late at night, there was nothing you could have done to stop me. This is not your fault. You are amazing and I look forward to watching down on you and your future, i know you will do amazing things. To my fellow redditors feeling the same thing.

"I have been helping everyone, but who is going to help me? Hearing the comments they make about depression makes me feel disgusted, I thought they would understand how it feels. No one seems to care about me. I could disappear and no one would notice. Why, what did I do wrong. I just want to be like everyone else. I am tired of keeping everything to myself. I have no one to talk to. I am sorry I just need to get it out. I am tired",0
I was and I say was because I called my doctor and told her I am stopping it.. I was on 10mg of Escitalopram and after almost a month of taking it (I had 6 pills left out of 30) I told her I could not handle the cold legs and feet and occasionally around my chest and rarely arms.. she told me to cold turkey because it was not even a month. Its been three days of not taking it and I feel the paresthesia I used to have coming back slowly besides knowing that it gives you paresthesia while taking it and discontinuing it as a side effect but it was more relaxing while taking it then never having and having to deal with the neuropathy symptoms.. It had pros such as 1. me taking a deep breath and not feeling that heavy rock on my chest. 2. Wanting to do more.3. Half and half on being anxious meaning i had days where I was not and was.4. Less depressed 5. No headaches anymoreCons. 1. Cold legs and feet since June 182. Anxious due to the cold feet/legs.. 3. Body temperature was all over.. I do not understand for a person that lives in the ER I did not pay a visit or exaggerate to get seen and tested. Blood panel was great according to Doctor. that is about it Other than that I had no common side effects. PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ON YOUR OPINION .. Hey guys sorry.,0

I have not been on since the 2nd time I almost died, and realized I should not be here in the first place. I do not think I was meant to live. I feel like every breath I take is a struggle to prove that I deserve to be here. But you know what? I do not. I have not deserved to be here since I forgot who I was. I have not deserved to open my eyes since I started to realized how depressed I was. I have not deserved to live since I decided to focus on how to make myself not want to die. I am done. I am tired of justifying my literal existence to myself every morning. I am a shifty friend, partner, and family member. I do not deserve someone is pitty call/text to see if I am ok. I do not deserve the partner who asks how I am doing and I lie to make them feel alright. I do not deserve anything. And I am selfish, and ok with that.

I have been depressed lately and nothing and I mean NOTHING makes me happy. I do not feel sad anymore just 24h/24. I would do anything to change that and my psychologist suggested medication but I really do not know if that is a good idea. Because I feel like it is only hiding the problem and I have read so much horror stories about medication. Also every story that I have read about people that were happy about their medication they only took it for like ~1 week/2/3 months and they are saying that it helps but I never see a story about someone who is not in the beginning of taking if. Maybe it is a coincidence. At the same time I am so tired of feeling always so empty and I miss when I used to enjoy things. Is medication a good idea?,0

"I have felt completely hopeless since my doctor had this conversation with me. I am 23 and I have been diagnosed with depression for 11 years. Its a struggle every single minute of every day, and my depression has only continued to worsen as the years have gone on. I have tried different medications including various groups of antidepressants, anti-anxiety medication, and natural remedies. I have been to many different types of therapy - CBT, DBT, animal assisted therapy, play therapy (when I was younger), art therapy, group therapy, equine therapy, counselling, and trauma focused therapy. I have had involvement from psychiatry, school nurses, community nurses, crisis team, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and peer mentors. I have tried things like behavioural activation, sleep hygiene, massages, acupuncture, self care, distraction etc. I was even hospitalised for 3 years. I feel like I have exhausted every option and I do not know what else I could try. I have applied for various trials but I am not eligible due to physical disability. Its important to note that I was depressed before I became physically disabled, so that is not the reason I am struggling. I do not even know why I am depressed. there is definitely trauma I could pin it on but it does not bother me anymore. I do not think about my past experiences anymore. I am just stuck feeling depressed. Has anyone else tried anything that is worked better for treatment resistant depression? Thanks My doctor told me Ill always be depressed because I am autistic.",0

I have a traumatic childhood, history of abusive relationships, a pedophilic experience, self harm abuse etc and no one thought to check in on me? I would like to say I am wallowing and giving myself sympathy but my brain is literally out to get me everyday.I am not allowed to exist, let alone get professional help.

I have no identity. No one cares to know who I am, and in turn, never gave myself a chance to know eitherOne more rejection will be the final nail in the coffin, I am so mentally unstable that it will make or break me, and I am scared for the latter.I wish I could tell my friends and family how I feel but I could not bear to be even more of a burden to them than I already am.Sorry if you have been unfortunate enough to find this post, I just needed some sort of message out there to the universe and see if it has anything positive to reply with Born to please others, will death be the only true selfish action I perform on myself?",1

The girl I met in high school and then become lovers died after 4 years of dating after high school, family is also non existant, had health issues etc.I was pretty okay with many stuff starting the life without a lack of family, having hard time to find my place in the social life and such and always felt strong enough to deal with everything but as the time goes I just got tired of being strong, acting strong, trying to implement myself in to social life and finding people to bond with have a good time with.And recently by losing the last person I felt some connection to the world being gone and myself having some health issues that may or may not be important, having to lose all my friends and now that not being able to find new people and such, I just got really tired, really tired, I carried so much stuff as a child and a grown up but somehow I am now exhausted I never thought I will be this tired in life like ever.I always been a observer but I am tired of being one because I cannot fit myself in to anything nowadays and I am tired of seeing people being happy with something/someone I started to get jealous and question my life and found the details I ignored all this time.That questioning part lead me to asking; Did I really deserved everything? Because should not that be go like, bad things happen then you get some happiness and then it gets a straight line for normal and always climbs up for people who are extremely lucky. (I know there is no rule this is just a random vent I guess?)I concluded on that I do not deserve to be alive and I do not fit in anywhere in life anymore. So therefore I believe that I should just give up at this point because I had enough, I tried enough, I fought enough.Funny part is I still love life, how things go for people around me as I said I spent so much time observing them and I like how good things going for them etc. I am just tired of mine going flat down with everything, literally everything.I kind of do not expect anything from anyone and I still have like a pages of things that I can talk about and the saddest part is I am aware of literally everything; my situation, what should I do, how I sound etc.Anyways this is the chaos going on in my head that I plan to solve by giving up,Thank you. I think I have arrived the end of this road.",1
"TLDR When I am not good at something it bothers me until I am depressed and hating myselfEvery time I play a game of chess or I figure out something I am not good at it bothers me like hell I cannot get over the things I am not good at even if I do not enjoy it. I hit myself in the head and stress ALOT about things that I do not even enjoy.it is weird it is like I do not specifically enjoy the thing I am doing like chess,hair, etc and I still stress about it.I do not KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN. I do not remember the last time I specifically had fun because I am too serious and competetive. This is why I deleted social media. Whenever someone tells me (maybe this thing is not for you) I see it as a insult that me as a person is not smart or good enough for this specific activity and it pisses me off. I want to be good at everything and it bothers me when I am not. I lose or fail at something like a video game and it runs my day and I let it. it is so hard to not let the little things bother me.Is this perfectionism? Or am I just trying too hard at everything? How do I get rid of this?",0

"Hi everyone. I am an 18 year old Male, and I have been depressed ever for about 5 years. For the longest time, I have been captive to suffering in silence. But I cannot keep it in anymore. I need help, and I am fucking terrified to admit it. My depression has been getting steadily worse for a year. I have been close to ending it all many times, I feel like I am drowning, but every day I put on my smile and act like nothing is going on.I cannot keep doing this. But I do not know how to tell my family how I feel. I hardly know how to talk to anyone anymore. I could really use some advice from those of you who have been in my shoes, talked to someone, and got help. Thank you all in advance. I am considering opening up to my family, I need pointers.",0

"just realized tonight that I am so desperate for validation that it makes me feel helpless... i just want someone to See me and acknowledge me and recognize that I am here and that I am struggling even though my issues are not as big as other peoples... i want it so badly i cannot even begin to describe what i want... i thought i just wanted attention but actual attention makes me feel exposed and raw like my skins gone, and i thought attention from a therapist would help but it just feels like its not scratching the right itch... it feels like my brain wants me to make up for 20 years of being ignored and pushed to the sidelines because i was too quiet and anxious and probably autistic to have any adults or teachers pay attention to me desperate for validation",0

"A part of me feels like absolute shit that I have come to the point of ranting on reddit because despite the amount of friends and other family members I have, it always feels like no one wants to listen to me anymore. And even if they did, it always felt like they are doing such a bothersome chore. Every word is just a copy and paste.Everyone only pays attention or 'gives a shit' because they do not want to look bad if I do end up killing myself. I absolutely hate it when people tell me that they will always be there for me and when I do come and ask for help or someone to hear me out, they are quick to go off and play games with some fuckwit of a person or just simply ghost. Even worse, proceed to say that they do not know how to handle it after leading me on that they are someone I could count on to listen to and whatever. Only then to have them one day come back and show how proud they were for helping some random person online who was suicidal while I got the treatment of ""I do not know what to say :("" despite them writing billions of words and poetry to someone else. Life sucks. People suck. My mum is shit. I just want to die. But at the same time, it is not death that I want?? it is just, I want to die so I can be reborn and restart somewhere else, where I do not know these current people in my life or be in the same family as my mum anymore.

"Hey you all. I read through this subreddit all the time looking for motivation? Or hope? Or I am not sure, but I cannot keep waking up everyday feeling like this. Not for 5 more hours and surely not for 50 more years. I currently work two jobs, one full time one part time I average 60-72 hours a week. I am 21 and burnt the fuck out. So this is where the cycle begins, let me take you through my thought process. I work two jobs so I can be closer to financial stability yea? So I can have the funds to save money AND afford my basic living needs as well as recreational wants (usually weed and concerts. Not too many clothes or fast food etc.) I just do not feel like this is a way to live.I am tired, my mental health is collapsing. I have no hobbies, because I do not stick with anything I start. Usually that is because I realize ""hey, there is no way to make money doing X"". Which means leaving a job to pursue a passion might be me shooting myself in the foot when hours drop at my main job (they usually drop for everyone in Q1, but that is 3 months that I would only be averaging 24-30 hours instead of 40 and that is a lot of money to someone living paycheck to paycheck). Why am I so worried about money? Because we live in a world where if you do not know what $60,000 piece of paper you want to go for at the age of 18 then you are already at a disadvantage. I am trying to find a healthy balance of realism and optimism, but whenever I go to older people for advice they just say ""you are young. This is the world, your eyes will open to more and you might not like what you see"".When I was 19 I worked 72 hours a week 5 days a week, and the other 2 days I was enrolled in community college for 18 credit hours. I had no days off. My days off I had school work. That only lasted a few months before my grades collapsed and I ended up in the hospital for a suicide attempt. I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of WANTING to feel good about myself, actually starting to feel good, then life happens and I am worried about money. In the past 7 months I have switched medications and psychiatrists twice, been diagnosed with an STD, gotten fired because a job did not realize they hired me at 20 instead of 21, had my motorcycle stolen, lost my AC in my car, my apartment flooded last week and I had to have fans in my apartment for a full week which was annoying as I work 16 hour days, and at the end of a long day I would barely be able to sleep in my loud freezing cold apartment. I try not to downplay my truth, even if it is not as painful or awful as others because this is the life I have to live. I cannot compare my suffering to others to make myself feel better. And I know I do not have to live on my own, going home would save money but at this point my mental health is so shit that I feel like my independence is all I have. Take away my apartment and my car, I have nothing to work for. Nothing to live for. Yes I have loving friends and family but what is the point in being alive if it is for everyone and everything BUT me. What is wrong with me? At this point I am not even sure if it is an actual chemical imbalance, or if I am just waking up to the fact that this is real life, most humans cannot move up the ladder, and if I cannot ""control my reaction"" properly I will not enjoy my next 50 years on this planet. I am so tired of feeling like my shitty mental health is so profitable, that I am not meant to feel good in this life. My boyfriend and bestfriend are so worried because they do not think they can provide the help I need. I have been to psychiatric wards and our mental healthcare in America is a fucking joke. I wish crying in my car was an Olympic sport because I breakdown every other fucking week. I just cannot keep feeling like this. With all these overwhelming thoughts of the future, and not being able to forgive myself for the past.Not for 5 more hours. And surely not for 50 more years. stuck in a neverending loop of feeling inadequate because that is how I am/we are ""meant"" to feel 21f",1

I know he does not love me anymore and has possibly moved on, but hes my best friend and I cannot let him go which hurts because I still love him the same amount as the day I realized if not more. He knows about my suicidal thoughts and my kidney failure but refuses to accept that I am on my last legs &amp; cannot continue like this. Hes usually there to prevent me from hurting myself or attempting because I reach out to him but this time I am not going to. My question is should I tell him or text him I love him one last time? If I do this I plan to block him immediately after. Or should I just leave it be and go without a word? Should I tell him?",1

"I do not think I have clinical depression, I have situational depression.

I also do not have any friends due to social anxiety, the only people I have close to me is my parents. But, living with them is hell due to the fact that my mom is a hoarder. I have been suffering living in this house for years and I have been dying to get out. I am extremely sensitive to noise and smells and I really need my own place so I can feel hygienic and clean and organized. This house grosses me out so much sometimes I feel like I cannot breathe. well finally last year I got a job and I work from home now, finally I can afford to move out. problem is I have been looking for a place since October , looking at both buying or renting, and I cannot find a place at all. I have put multiple offers on houses , offered way over asking price, all got rejected because I got beat out by cash offers. when it comes to Apartments there are none available so I am on a bunch of waitlists. All I want is my own space so I can actually cook homemade meals and feel clean and breathe clean air. Is that so much to ask for? Why does this world want me to suffer?

"Not sure if I am allowed to share the link here but it is called 'How to recover from depression' on youtube. It contains a very thorough and well-reasoned perspective on depression, its multitude of causal factors, the effects, the need for a unique treatment plan (not just meds / talking / exercise) that is based on the causes of your individual depression. it is made me feel slightly more in control, slightly less prone to believing my negative thought castles, and slightly more hopeful. Overall I feel significantly less depressed right now, after over a week of full on black dog mode. Highly recommend giving it a look. Watched a video that lifted me up for the first time in days",0
"There is nothing in my life that i wish more than death yet i am still afraid of doing the thing. I am such a coward, i cannot live a life but i cannot even die, what the hell am i doing here?

But i are not no American and the only way i have to take my life is through something painful or that does not grant instant death. Should i hang myself if i cannot achieve a full suspension? Hell no, low suspension method is too risky, takes too much time and there is always a chance for an ""hero"" to appear... Imagine living a life with a brain that is so rotten it does not allow you to wipe your ass, It would be surprisingly worse than before. Then should i just jump from height? And what if i cannot manage to land on the head? It will be an excruciatingly way to leave this place and i do not want to suffer more than I have already did in my life. What other choices do i have left? I do not know, i am not very smart and i cannot think of a painlessly way to die on my own but if you try to search on the internet for a way to do it, you will only get suicide hotlines numbers and related stuff.Everything related to suicide is literally censored. We basically have no right to die in this sick, cruel world to the extent that we are forced to stay here, just waiting for the death to come. That is sick, why is that so? It feels cruel to force people living a life of pain and suffering, it feels scary to think you do not have the right to take your own life. I am just waiting for the death to come.",1

I do not have any reason to be sad yet here I am sad everyday living my life pretending I am ok so nobody around me has to worry about me. I do not think I am pushed to suicide yet as I think 1% of me likes to believe things will get better but it is been like this for 6 years and I do not know if I can do another 6 of it, at that point it is like what is the point in living if nothing gets better.

"I am 29M. Lost my 32YO brother in Sep of 2018 to suicide.The death was unexpected. He was a successful realtor, breadwinner of the family, soon to be engaged and everything seemed to be going so well.It decimated our family and completely shattered any semblance of hope in the future we have. Its one of the most challenging ways to leave your family because no matter what reason you have, it will never make sense. In hindsight all of the problems he said he was having in his suicide letter were so easily correctable and fixable. I wish we had a chance. I, myself have been on the brink of suicide many times since this, but all i can think of is my mother and sister and father crying how they did when he left.Suicide takes away your pain, but it will leave your family with lifelong guilt, sorrow, and just unexplainable pain. I love you all and I hope you find peace. I am still working on mine and I will never give up because seeing my familys reaction to when I had to tell them about my bro was something that i still have nightmares about. I love you all.",1
"I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is ""for girls"" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my ""friends"" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this ""cool"" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of ""friends"" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said ""that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be""I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this ""one man wolf pack"" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.For those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. Hopefully I did not come off as too whiny. Looking to share my story of being bullied.",0
"23(M) stuck in Life for about 5 years now. I am just at home, in front of the PC. Barely going out, even tho i try my best doing it. Gained alot of weight and unemployed.

"I just needed to vent. I have been relatively fine (by which I mean not actively planning, although have had issues with EDs and SH) since my suicide attempt when I was 16 just over two years ago. I was sorting through all my books to move them to another book case and a little flashcard fell out of one, which turns out to be a suicide note I wrote to my girlfriend (now ex) a couple weeks before I attempted.It completely stopped me in my tracks. After just staring at it, I had to get up and turn off my music. I have just been staring into space for the last 20 minutes.do not get me wrong, this is not triggering me into wanting to commit again, in fact quite the opposite, but I feel emotionally broken. I had already found some other triggering items from the same time period but this was just too muchThe worst thing is that I do not even remember writing it - I had no idea this existed until now. Its short; only a few sentences long as I clearly did not know what to say. It just breaks my heart that I was in that place mentally, and I can genuinely hand-on-heart say that I am glad my attempt did not work. Not because life is easy now, but because the balance has shifted to more good days than bad (through a shit ton of hard work, meds and therapy). And it is worth that fight even despite feeling hopeless at the time. Idek if this belongs here, but I just needed to talk to someone. Sending well wishes to anyone who may be reading this. Just found my suicide note from 2 years ago",1
"I am so sick of having the same conversation over and over. everytime i try opening up to her she always tries to fix all my issues instead of just fucking listening, and then she wonders why i do not come talk to her anymore. I am not going to you for solutions or to be lectured, i just need someone to actually fucking listen for once. if you really cared and really wanted the best for me you would stop focusing so much on my fucking phone and actually listen to what I am telling you. I. NEED. FUCKING. HELP. i do not need my phone taken away and i do not need to be yelled at. I am so fed up w this bullshit and i wish parents would stop assuming they know everything cuz they do not and its fucking tiring. my mother thinks that my phone is causing my depression",1
"my bestfriend means the world to me, he has been there at my worst and always had my back. I gave him the highest priority, before me, my fam, my everything and every small thing he does unintentionally now, HURTS. I spoke up to him and asked him to man up and leave a proper goodbye and instead, he stayed and took the blame. He worked things out between us, it feels he is too good for me and he deserves a lot more better than me. My insecurities keep acting every now and then, people think am in love with him lmao but no, i just care too much. The gut feeling that he will leave too, that am not enough for him and seeing him getting closer to his new friends each time makes me want to believe that gut feeling more which i do not want to. He is the one am overthinking about each time and any day, i will always choose him. At the end of the day i just want him by my side :""). it is funny how my happiness depends on him because HE IS MY HAPPINESS. This guy got some influence on me which i make it seem negative but somewhere he is why am holding on to my life. He makes me weak, he is my weakness. Idek what to do lol but what i know is am never leaving him i have relationship issues even without being in one",0
"This weekend I sat in the hours by myself like I usually do and it just hit harder this time. I joined BetterHelp in hope of find a way to get myself out of this. I use to be so happy, making jokes all the time calling and texting people but now I just cannot find the reason to do any of it. My family has fallen apart I cannot even have a real conversation with my dad and my mom is just said and I feel for her. I try to distract myself from it but the distraction does not last for long or it just does not work. I am constantly thinking about the old me. The younger me that had friends and would be out of the house all the time. I just feel like there is nothing left me. Ill probably never find love and will just die alone. Its all even harder as a black male, Its like depression in black men just do not exist. I just want this shit to be over. How do you stop feeling so alone? How do you go back to being the old you or even just a newer version of yourself? How do you feel loved again? People make it seem like it just so easy to get all the feeling out of your head but they just do not understand that its not that simple. I am just not feel it anymore",0
"I am tired of being alone, broke, in the dark - breathing without any purpose. I do not understand anything right now. I might just do it. I am just tired. Why am I alive? it is not a rhetorical question, I really want to know.",1
"I feel so incompetent, in terms of everything.Everyone always tells me that they all expect big things from me. I just keep pushing and pushing myself to show to my parents and family that I am a good daughter. I study hard, work two jobs, do so many extracurriculars. they are not satisfied.I do not know what anyone wants from me anymore. I feel like I have pushed myself to my limits but my parents say I can be better and more like other girls. I have been friends with this girl whose just been perfect for her entire life, Perfect grades, perfect extracurriculars, perfect everything, everyone under the sun loves her. she is great and she is a wonderful friend too, but god, I have been getting compared to her since I was three. I get compared to other friends too, whether it be grades, body, how they talk. College app season is coming up, so now I feel more like shit than ever, every turn I make I am doing something wrong according to my family.I cannot make friends anymore because I am scared my parents will just compare them to me. I am so tired.My mom always tells me to either be extraordinary or be nothing. I cannot be extraordinary. I am not extraordinary at anything. I am not good enough for her. I just want her to be proud of me. Sometimes she says she is going to kill herself because of me, she did less than an hour back. I do not know what to do or say. she is also said she will kill me and then herself. I have no fucking idea what I am supposed to say. Tell her to stop? Ask for help? I am stuck.My dad wants me to bridge the gap between us and says I need to respect her. I have been respecting her. I keep my head down, mouth shut, listen to what she says, and then just compartmentalize it until one day the damn breaks and I have a fucking breakdown like I am right now. I cannot push myself any further. I just want to the floor to swallow me whole. I have no drive for anything anymore.I am never enough for anyone, I am not enough for myself, and I just want to end things. I am sick of this feeling and it is not going away. I have no tears left to she would or anything left to do. I am so fucking stuck at this point it feels like the only way out is to just leave.Today, I was reading through my old stories that I wrote a year or two back. All I can think about is where all that passion and creativity went. I used to thrive off of writing stories and publishing them anonymously. I used to keep them hidden from my friends and family because I wanted my writing to be separate from them. From all the expectations and criticism.I cannot even formulate a story anymore. there is nothing left.I am doing everyone wrong. I do not have the energy to speak with anyone, friends, family, my own boyfriend who deserves so much better than someone who cannot find the energy to text them. I just feel drained and tired all the time, and all I want to do is fall back asleep and never wake up.And I lost the only two friends I ever had I could talk to about this because of issues between their parents and my parents. they have forgotten about me probably and I am glad they did. they are probably doing better without having to deal with me. I wrote them an apology today for being the person I was and not doing enough for them.I do not know what anyone wants from me. I just feel disoriented and tired. I do not know how to fix this except just go. Apologies if this is too long. I do not know what people want from me. I feel tired of it all.",0
"So honestly I am just wondering if this is normal, getting better, or I should be concerned. I had a whole plan to unalive (I have tried like 3 times over the last 10 yrs.) but it had to be in the am before anyone was awake and my alarm went off and I was legit too tired to even go through with it. Like I hate life, I am tired of this but I could not make myself get up. Is this normal depression behavior?",0
"do not go back into that place again, its not worth the pain. people may always try to bring you down, but there is always hands to bring you back up from that hole. its not worth the energy going back keep striving forward. you will have people asking if your ok only keep those people at arms length. your true people that know you and care for you will always know when your not ok. they will always listen and try to take your mind away from those people that only just pretend.sometimes it will be you just one against those people that will use your energy and twist it. they know your struggling but will not come near you to put that arm round and hear you. you see these people on a daily do not let the fakr sincerety or smiles sway you. they are only there to distract you from that positive energy. no matter how much you try they will not.always stop for the those that take there time to understand you know when that pain and black cloud is there. these people will be your family. some people will hear your jokes and think your happy but not understand the pain behind it. family wilp aleays hear your jokes and see through. stop putting on that smile for everyone be honest.the truth hurts the softest ears but cannot offend the strongest. never be afraid to be honest! silence is definitely golden. show the effort that people put in to youn Struggling not to go backwards",0
"I am 15 and i was diagnosed with depression last 2018 but till now i cannot get a proper treatment because my family cannot afford a psychiatrist. I know that its getting worse every single day,I just want to live a happy and normal life.But everyday that i wake up I feel miserable like why cannot I just die. Its really tiring and I just do not know what to feel. I do not have a will to live anymore but I cannot get to kill myself which makes me more miserable because if i do not want to live,why am I still here then? Feeling hopeless",0
"context for this post is that I have struggled with depression for most of my life. i was not in a position to do anything about it before, up until very recently, because it was never just the only problems i had going on. there was always some other Serious Issue slammed into eight other things that i had to work my way around every day in order to actually function. a lot has happened these past two years. i have stabler relationships, i have friends who i like (i just cannot really talk to them about any of these issues because they have never experienced long lasting significant mental health issues and have personally told me that while they are here for me, they do not understand and have no frame of reference to understand what I am going through). most of the things that I have had to deal with these past six or seven years- extreme mood swings, crushing apathy towards anything, loss of interest in activities and eating etc. have mostly died down into what i would call normal levels that almost everyone experiences in their life. they are manageable i guess for lack of better words. the only downside was that it meant that the week long (sometimes even months long) depressive episodes and sudden onsets of debilitating depression *(its just depression in it is severe bland dictionary meaning. severe feelings of despondency and despair. i do not have any other way of explaining it)* have gone from being pushed to the side lines in order to deal with other stuff, to front and centre of my life now. i cry on the commute back and forth between my classes. two weeks ago the feelings of depression that I would been crushing down all week suddenly peaked and i skipped my last two classes because i genuinely did not feel up to it mentally or able to concentrate or focus because of how bad i felt and how depressed i was. i wish i was exaggerating in order to make a coherent and simple case of *'yeah here is proof that i have debilitation depression that affects my life 24/7'* but I am not, when i say that every day i have to fight down the majority of me that goes 'avoid your friends hide out in the bathrooms during intervals and breaks until you are normal and capable of human interaction again' even if i know in my head that being around my friends will make me feel better and that seeing them will remind me that no matter how stupid things are for me mentally right now that they are there. sometimes i win and sometimes i do not. it feels like an uphill battle where none of the lessons i learn (being with friends is good. do not isolate yourself) get retained or remembered through idk brain muscle memory or anything. this is the best that I have been in years, if only because I have managed to keep it at a *'one step forward two steps back herculean effort to take another one step forward to balance things again'* cycle. but i know its only going to get harder and more intense for me at school next year because of the increase in workload and just the general insanity of stress and uni applications and important exams that determine your future and decisions that I am making this year that are supposed to be plans for the next five years of my life. right now feels like the only opportunity I will have to take some kind of action (medication lmao) and get used to all the side effects, while the academic stakes are still relatively manageable even if it makes me cry sometimes. i guess for me it was always the money that made feel :| about getting diagnosed and the leftover remains of when i was more seriously mentally ill (being alive is a waste of money complex hahaha). the counsellor I have been seeing for the past three or something years tried to broach the topic of *possible diagnosis for depression* *just in my opinion it mgiht be wrong just let me say my opinion and you can disagree this is based off of what i know from seeing you semi regularly for these last few years* two weeks ago (same day i missed those last two classes lmao) but i shot them down because there is really no pathway after getting diagnosed, at least not for me, that does not end in medication. I have been friends with a few people who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder among other depression disorders, all of which took medication. we have fallen out of contact due to the past year of lockdown and pandemic etc but i still remember talking to them about the side effects of medication and whether it was really worth it because they were still in pain they were still struggling even on medication. talking to them made me realize that they were right and that it could only get worse if treatment was not taken. some potentially severe side effects are worth not feeling like hell and being obstructed by your own mind every day of your life. **the only issue is my parents, who despite knowing almost zero if not absolutely nothing about depression and other mental health issues (genuine quote from one of them was 'i know nothing about this and i do not understand and i do not need you to explain it to me. medication has terrible side effects that will ruin your life) yet still manage to have hardline anti-medication, for lack of better words, views because of their percieved horrific life ruining side effects.** is medication worth it despite the side effects?",0
"Okay, first of all I am a 19 years old male living in a third world country from a low class family, my life has turned into hell since the past year I started having weird pains in all of my body joints and muscles + many other complicated symptoms which made it impossible for the incompetent doctors in my country to diagnose me, so they kept giving me pain killers and they do not even listen to me properly when describing the symptoms because like I said they are very complicated and I myself have a difficult time trying to communicate them, I have grown tolerant to the pain killers and my condition is worsening making me unable to preform day to day activities, I have been watching my life being taken from me day by day and I have lost any hope of recovery as I am not even diagnosed, I think of killing myself everyday, I wake up everyday and the first thing I think of is ""why am I still alive?"", I want some hope, I want this to end (either ways) as soon as possible, I do not know what to ask for here, I was planning to ask for the best way to kill myself ( keeping in mind I live in third world country where it is impossible to get assisted suicide ), but I guess my post will be banned, *sighing* I want this to end, please give me anything, any suggestions, any help! I want to end this, but how?",1

"Hi! I will be as brief as possible and I will try to lay this out clearly. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post!Background: I am going through rather a hard time at the moment. I had to take off work until September due to severe depression, which I have suffered with for about 7 years now. It came to a head last year, when my pretty horrible boyfriend of nearly a decade finally left me. This is the first time I have ever had to go on ""sick leave,"" and I hate it. I am so, so lucky that I have this option, but I still feel embarrassed and frustrated that it is come to this point. Problem: I have been seeing a psychologist and he always tells me to make friends. he is been harping on it for the last few weeks and this last Friday he gave it to me as my ""homework,"" for our next session. Truth be told I really, really want a good friend because I have never actually had one before. My problem is that I have already *tried* to make new friends, and it went horribly. Back in February he gave me a similar piece of ""homework,"" and I ended up emailing some people I know pretty well from work and church. I worked hard on the emails, personalized them, and I had really high hopes when I sent them out. Hopes which were dashed when nobody responded to any of the emails. I feel crazy admitting this, but this put me in a pretty horrible state for a while and really killed what was left of my self esteem. I honestly do not think I will ever be ready to do that again, because another rejection like that could actually kill me. I do, however, recognize that I have to pull myself back up and try again if I ever want to get better.Question: What is the safest way for a very sensitive, sad woman to make friends? Is there any way to reach out to people with less risk of rejection? All the mental health websites I can find recommend ""reaching out to people,"" or ""making friends"" but none of them tell me what to do in the event that nobody wants to be my friend. I am just really, really scared of being rejected again. What is the safest way for a very depressed woman to make new friends?",0
there is truly no easy way to go peacefully with no pain is there? Hanged myself and panic set in,1
People can really make your day so shitty and make you feel awful about yourself. I really hate myself and wish Id be dead by now. What an awful day today was,0
"I am in a weird mood regarding all this and I will start off by saying I know I fucked up. I knew I was fucking up as I was doing it, and at the time I did not care.I fell in love with a girl who was not available. I thought she was awesome so I asked her out and she politely turned me down, saying she had a boyfriend. I was willing to leave it there, but as the time went on she kept flirting with me. Told me she wanted to leave her boyfriend and be with me. Told me she loved me. Told me she wanted to move in with me. And I believed her.Until today when I got news that she is pregnant. And she is staying with him.I am 26 years old. Never been in a relationship. Every time I have tried, I have gotten hurt in exactly this way. And I knew going in that there was a chance, a good chance even, that this would end the same way. And I did it anyway because I thought this time would be different. I *believed* this time would be different.I cut myself for the first time today. I have been depressed since I was a child, but I never really saw the appeal. Now I do.I am going to move forward. I am going to work my way through this pain and keep searching for the one who is not going to hurt me. But that does not mean it does not hurt now. I want to give up and just die in a hole, and it hurts even worse because I know I will not. I know that I will get up, brush myself off, and keep on going even though that is not what I want.I do not know or care who you are. I do not know why you are reading this. But if you are please pray for me. Because I am a good person who falls in love too easily and I need some kindness now more than ever.I have learned my lesson. Now I just want it to stop hurting. I gave everything I had",0
"I am lost, adrift, with no hope of rescue and no hope that the future is going to be less terrible. The only reason I have not put my shotgun barrel into my mouth is because I have a wife and kids who are depending on me. Antidepressant medication is just barely doing anything, and I have not had luck with therapy. I am out of options but to continue on this dead-end path to nowhere. The world is headed down a spiral to mass death and doom, and nobody cares to stop it. Everything is hopeless and it does not matter. I deserve to suffer because I am a member of this accursed species. I fantasize about killing myself every day",0
I feel like such a burden on everyone in my life even when I talk to my friends they always seem like they do not want to be there and would rather be doing something else I feel like such a burden,0
"will i ever be noticed? is my life worth anything? i spend all day doing nothing, full of sorrow and pain, while wishing pain on others. i waste my time, day, after day, after day, slowly killing myself mentally. the isolation is killing me. i have no one to talk to about it, it feels like I am going to hurt myself or someone else, but I am too afraid to act on it solely because i do not want to go back to the mental hospital. who am i? why am i here? what is my point anymore? i do not want to waste away like this, i work so hard to get better, my days always start off promising but go to shit quickly. it feels like life itself is playing me like a fiddle, why though? what did i do to deserve this pain? I have been like this since i was a mere toddler, so why me? did i commit a major sin in my past life? was there a past life? i do not know anymore. i wanted to grow up to help people, to be a leader, to change peoples lives for the better, but now i will not be anything. at most, ill be homeless, at worst ill be dead, but is it really that bad? is it bad to lose my life anymore? nobody would miss me. i destroyed all of my relationships. i only have my mother, i love my mother, she is been through so much, she is so strong and I am so proud of her, but i do not think i want to continue to live like this. i just want to escape, i cannot embrace this life anymore, for it has brought me to my knees. if anyone ever sees this, i it will probably be after my death. so be it. nobody would miss me. i do not care anymore. i will not even miss myself. I am just too afraid to go through with it, i do not have a gun, i do not have anything of that sort, so what do i do? i do not feel like a human. i feel subhuman, i feel like nothing, why was i born this way, WHY? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO? I DID NOTHING. I JUST WANTED A NICE AND SAFE JOURNEY, BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO GO INSANE FROM ISOLATION. this is not even mentioning all of the voices and stuff i see, its probably due to loneliness, i hear people calling my name, a comforting girls voice, a girl i do not even know, a girl i will never know. right before i sleep i am haunted with the noises of people saying my name, as if I am at my deathbed. i know it is unrealistic, though. because no one would miss me in reality. I am a nobody, i do nothing to help other people, I have been a mental cripple my entire life. its only become apparent recently, when all of my friendships came falling down solely because i am a horrible friend, and horrible, narcissistic, degenerate of a person in general. this is not even the worst I have felt, last night was when i cried harder than I have ever cried, i had to cover my mouth to prevent screaming, i do not want my mom to worry about me. my mom deserves everything for how hard she works for me, even after my dad died. i know my dad would be sad if i go through with killing myself, but hes not here anymore, hes in a better place. i know that my life is going to get worse from here, my teenage years have just started, and it feels like i am really losing my mind. do i deserve this? is this because of all my past mistakes? i do not know, and i will not ever know. what hurts most is that everyone i know would tell me how much i change, that i was not the same funny, happy, helpful me. that is what my friend told me right before we stopped talking. I am such a selfish fucking bitch. i always talk about other people not being empathetic, but i myself am not empathetic, and only paint myself to be so other people feel bad, am i really just this bad of a person? is all I am looking for a reaction from everyone so that i can finally know they care, or make them care? i do not know. i do not know answers to any of this. i feel like I am going insane with all these thoughts flowing around my head, there is nothing that calms them anymore, i am just filled with negative emotions, and i have no way to control them. i know i will never be off meds. last time i was, i was crying harder than i have ever cried, and i had the worst homicidal thoughts. at this point, its a struggle to keep myself from hurting myself and others. i bet it would be a lot better for everyone if i was gone, nobody would be hurt. thank you if you read this whole thing. it feels like I am the only one alive, like I am in a city at night, snow all over, with the streets being empty, not a sign of life. i feel like this is a key part of my narcissistic thinking, i believe that i am special in some way, i am not, but i think that to make myself feel better about being a nobody. I am done showing everyone empathy when they show not a single bit of concern back. am i really selfish for doing that, when they do not do anything to make me feel better? nobody even comforts me anymore. i do not I am just sitting at my chair, writing all day about my thoughts. not sure why, its just addicting, it makes me see the point I am at, my thinking, my supposed insanity. when will it get better? will it really ever get better? i do not feel angry anymore. I am just full of sorrow and pain. the mere hope that someone is sees what I am going through and helps out is the only thing keeping me going, but i know at one point it will be gone. gone like my past self, gone like my friends, gone like my dad, gone like everything i ever loved, gone like all of my hopes and dreams. what if i show this to my doctor? would that help? or would he throw me in a mental hospital? I am already suspicous of the meds, I am suspcious of everyone who works as a mental health professional, they just work to make money off of peoples suffering, that is what my brain tells me. i know its the truth because i have seen human greed for money and power. the current society is destroying the regular human, while benefitting the small minority at the top. have i really made any progress in the last what, year and a half? i do not feel like i have. it feels like everythings getting worse. everything has gotten worse. if my mother would to die, that would be the final straw, at that point i really have no one. my mother was right, other people do not give a single FUCK about my problems. because they are all selfish and horrible people. everyone i know is, i have not met a single person who is not. is it just me? or what? i find it funny how my important would go up if i committed suicide. if i killed myself right now, everyone would come rushing, not because they care, but because they think they have the blood on their hands. they do not. its all on me, I am the one who decided to take my life to begin with. i was not born on my own, but i have the right to take my life, because i will be preventing other people from harm. i am a danger to myself and everyone around me at this point. i feel like I am at the point in my life where there is nothing left to do, but die. like i have the choice between sitting here, having pain, rotting away slowly, or killing myself and getting over with it. i feel like i relate to my dad a bit, when he was on the ventilator, it was causing him pain, that is why he had to be taken off. just like how i cannot stand the pain anymore, the pain is going to continue till i take my life. I am tired of seeing everyone else succeed, while I am sitting here crying about all my problems like the little bitch i am. I am jealous, just another sign that i am indeed a horrible person. i have never been proud of myself, nobody has ever been proud of me. i am a waste of oxygen, people promise that they care, but they are two faced liars. I KNOW IT. nobody would care about me simply because i do not benefit them in anyway. if i did benefit them, they would care. does that just show my hipocrisy? that i am really just a selfish person too? this has myself at a loss of words, because i was proven right by myself, i am simply a horrible person. i am the type of person i hate. so why continue? what is my point then? just to sit and continue to feel sadness and anger? i keep remembering when i first started to hurt, when i first was diagnosed with mental illness, it was not a shocker, it was not as bad as it is now. i feel paranoid, what if the meds only make me feel worse? what if they just want me to get worse so i pay them money until i die? fuckers. i was proven right, but this time about other people. when did it all go wrong, i do not understand, i say it started when i was young because i would harm myself, hallucinate, and have other symptoms, but am i right? idk. i just want to be like everyone else my age. i do not want to be who i am right now, feeling like a 25 year old man trapped inside of his apartment all day having no one to talk to and barely making by. the loneliness of this all, the fear of missing out, the want to be loved, to be held, to be cared for, its killing me inside, along with everything else. i will never experience love, i will never experience true care, i am too far gone at this point, there is no fucking point anymore. i do not want to live anyways, i will not experience the best things life has to offer. when i get my hands on a gun, the first thing I am going to do is go out for a walk, just enjoy the weather, then end it. so it can end on a calming note. nobody will miss me at all, not my mom, she will probably be dead due to preexisting conditions, i will not have anyone. why the fuck am i looked down upon by everyone for being mentally ill? it makes no sense to me. i feel like they are afraid of me, not that they think they are better, is this me anymore or this is something else? someone told me this is not me, this is my mental illness, what if i am my mental illness? i do not know to be honest. i think I am the real problem here, i think I am better than others, i think I am smarter, better, everything. I am just so unsure of everything now, my future, my life, my relationships. I am slowly discovering that I am just a really toxic person, why else would people start leaving me? its because i am objectively horrible. i do not care about anyone. i just want myself to be happy at the expense of others, its ironic, because i wanted to help others, and wanted mutual trust, but nope. i am really just this. i do not feel insane right now, just sort of filled with thoughts, feelings, i do not feel emotions or any form of empathy anymore, am i long gone? what happened to me? why does everyone say that the past me is gone, why? i do not know what changed. i do not feel the same, no, but i do not know what changed either. i want to be the old me again, I have been like this forever but it was not as severe before, what made it severe? will i ever know? i think everyone i know thinks this is an act, even when i tell them what is wrong, they seem to ignore it, they hope for the best, but the worst keeps coming, over and over, every day. my life is at the same point it was at when i was almost admitted to the mental hospital, which would have been the second time, but i was able to hide it well enough to where they did not think i was completely crazy. i do not know how long i can keep hiding it, i do not think i hide it anymore anyways, i just think people stopped caring about it, because it was not their problem. I am tired of not being noticed, not being able to experience what others are experiencing, i want to be like them, i want to be happy, i do not want to be what i am right now, right now i am a complete and utter mess, and i have nothing and no way to fix it. i do not know how long before i snap completely, i already feel like i have. i do not know when i might do something irrational to someone else or myself, the unpredictability of mental illness is what makes it so fucking bad. i just want to be happy. I am looking through all of my notes and seeing all my plans, all my schedules, everything i planned for the future, plans that i will never be able to fulfill. if i were given the independence i seek so badly, i would have ended myself, is that a good thing? i do not know. i think it would be good for the world if i was gone, i just feel like a burden to everyone at this point. i wrote a longer rant and bridged them all together, plus some more thoughts, should i talk to my doctor about this? i feel like he does not know what is wrong.",0
"So here is the situation. My girlfriend is having serous problems at home and is contemplating suicide. For reference her life has not been easy, her parents have both passed away from alcohol and she was once homeless. Now she is recently lost her job and her grandmother who she is living with will not let me see her until she finds a job and if she does not by next week she is going to be kicked out, even tho she is actively trying her hardest. Id have her move into my place but my mom will not allow it. She is refusing any help at this point and I am afraid she is not going to be there by tomorrow morning. I do not know what to do. I am really afraid. She not only has me but two siblings and a lot of friends who care about her. I know getting that through to people in that mindset can be next to impossible, but I am so scared that she will not be alive tomorrow. Someone please if there is any advice you have Ill take it. I just want her to live. she is so important to me. My girlfriend needs help, and idk what else to do",1

"I have bipolar II, so depression was a huge part of my life for a long long time before diagnosis and treatment. I have had my own journey, just like we all have, but I do not need to dive into my experiences because what I need to talk about is my husband. we will call him Z.Z has a loving family, friends, a job that appreciates him and pays him well, stable housing, time to do things he enjoys, no financial stress, the list goes on of things going right for him. We do not have kids, just a dog, but he is finding it increasingly difficult to care for another living thing regardless. He says textbook depression things. He says it is hard to wake up in the morning, he cannot do ""basic tasks"" like put away dishes or feed himself, he does not find joy in his usual hobbies anymore, he has not had a good night of sleep in ages, he is miserable and does not know why. The brain fog, the emotional outbursts, the sobbing fits, the constant feeling of trying to keep your head above water. Of course I cannot know exactly what he is going through because that experience is his own, but I KNOW these feelings. We all do. it is soul crushing when it is day in, day out. I have thankfully found my way out of the pit of depression through therapy, a correct diagnosis, and medication. it is not a perfect solution by any means, but I always say I never saw myself growing old until I got on 200mg of lamotrigine. I have pushed pursuing a treatment plan on him but he has a huge stigma against medication. He also goes in and out of denial that he even has depression and anxiety at all. He has been diagnosed and tried citalopram for about two months before calling it quits, this was back in February 2020. he is also tried three different therapists and they just never clicked, this was 2018-present. he is just been left feeling like he wasted time, money, and effort for nothing. I am getting him started on therapy again, though. we are also planning to try Wellbutrin this time. But nothing's set up yet, I am still sending out emails trying to find him a doctor.I try so hard, I really do. I pick up the dishes he cannot, I do the paperwork and write the emails he cannot, I cook and I clean so that he still gets food in his tummy and sleeps in clean sheets. At this point I feel like he only does his 9-5 and I fill in all the other gaps, which do not get me wrong I am so proud of him for maintaining a 9-5! I could not do that when I was at my worst! Additionally, he can get downright emotionally abusive and manipulative, but I take it with a grain of salt. Like I said, I have been there and I cannot even think of all the relationships I ruined or the people I hurt without feeling sick to my stomach from the guilt. I was not my best self, and I know it. I know he does not want to feel this way. I know making me cry is never the goal. I try to catch him when he is stable or lucid to talk to him, because when he is depressed he feels so far away. This is a completely anonymous reddit account so I would be honest and say if he was a burden to me or that I was beginning to resent him. Not at all. I love him unconditionally, but it is killing me to see him in such a hole that I cannot help him out of no matter what I do. Really when I look back on it our whole relationship has been dictated by his depression. it is always been present, but always he had something tangible to blame. But as each tangible problem is overcome another always seems to follow, how suspicious. I see it so clearly, but he does not see it this way. Another textbook depression thing he says is that he is not depressed, he is just lazy and useless. Everyday I check up on him and he either says he is feeling bad or ""bleh."" In this interim without a therapist I try to talk to him and help him reframe his thinking. Nothing sticks for long. I feel so helpless. I feel so scared. I am 100% intent on growing old with him but he will not make it to old going on like this, because I know I could not have. I guess my question is are there any similar experiences out there? What is there to do when you are watching a loved one just get wrecked by depression? I have asked myself the question of what would I have wanted at my lowest, and even though I try to give him that it does not ease the pain. But still, I ask you, what do you need at your lowest? Maybe I can apply it to him. I thought since I have also gone through it that I would be better equipped to help my husband through his depressive lows...",0
"Now I am stuck and I have to do a job that does not give a living wage and keep paying my bills till the day a die. I would rather quit. I am 20 and deciding living upto 70 to experience this shit sucks. People have kids only so that they can have someone to take care of when they are old. The world is collapsing and I want to collapse with it. I want to see the world burn. I just hope there are no humans on Earth. Covid should mutate and wipe out every human on this planet. Collapsing the society is the only way to save the planet. I asked my mother why she brought me into this cruel world. She said, ""If I did not have kids then the society would shame me.""",1
"Lately my only reason to keep going on is that online guy that I met weeks ago, he does not know but he is the only one who makes my life a lot better, I am waiting his birthday to wish him a happy birthday, because idk i want him to know that I care about him, and after all is one of the most amazing pp I have ever known in my life, even if he does not give a fuck bout me. I have so many siblings and my parents agree with the idea that if I die (only me) they will not care about it. Btw there is a lot of pp that talks to me, they only talk to me because they want nudes (I am a girl) and when I tell  them that I will not send nudes they magically stop caring about me, even I remember when one of them who told me that he wanted a future with me :( and after negating to send nudes he forgot me. I am so worthless to anybody in this world there is nobody who at least give a damn bout me. But they are right I am so stupid, lazy, good at nothing and the anxiety helps me to fuck everything and I have not ever done a good thing for someone. I only wish that my online friend's bday were sooner and that he were able to live his life for the 2 of us. Thanks for reading :) tired, tired and tired",1
"I am just exhausted. About to turn 34 and so worn out. Life is good, wife, cool step kids, good job. But my first memory is being in my room not wanting tomorrow to ever come. And that thought has never gone away. Medication and and a fast pace job makes things bearable but that thought never goes away. Repeating myself. Constantly. I am trying to live this life with normal people and all I do is let them down. You cannot just tell your family that you love them and that you do not want to wake up anymore. Worn out.",0
"My friends reported me to the school counselors for my thoughts/behavior, expressing that I have been wanting to die. They contacted my parents of course and they took away my phone there is a reason why I did not tell them T-T what the heck",1
"and I remember being depressed at 6 years old. 32 F. I have been jobless since April 2020, had to move back in with parents far away from where I was living, I have no friends, no prospects. I have not been social in such a long time that when I try to be now I end up stuttering and falling over all my words and fail to make any point or contribution to the conversation. I also have nothing to talk about because all I have been is depressed. I try to take up hobbies/ find things to make me happy, but I just cannot be happy or interested in anything. The whole job interview process is painful and the stuttering is just as bad. I have a lot of experience, but cannot blame them for not hiring me when I completely lack confidence and cannot put together a normal sounding sentence. I try to practice, but it does not work. The more job rejection I face, the worse everything gets. After being constantly rejected by jobs and guys I have dated, I have zero confidence left. I cannot even look in the mirror. I hate myself SO much. When I see my reflection I feel sick and disgusted with the person looking back. It sounds bizarre, but I have this really strange feeling of wanting to scrub my face off; I am so overcome with disgust I just want to physically scrub the disgust away. Last week I ended up looking like I had a severe sunburn after - it is such a strange urge that I had never experienced before. Now I am just avoiding the mirror altogether.I am so sick of everything. I just want to end it all. I have always struggled with depression, but this is the first time I have felt truly and completely hopeless. the worst it is ever been",0
"I had the knife in my hand, pressed against my wrist and I could not do it. It was not a revelation that I wanted to live again, but my own fear that it might hurt, that I might mess it up, that my family would walk in on it part way through and try to stop me. I thought about what the aftermath might be like. How it would be wrong for the last thing I ever do to be to upset everyone I care about. I do not have the will power to live, but I do not have the courage to die. I could not do it, I am a coward",1
"A year ago I had basically decided I was going to end it all unless I was offered to stay at my work and if the extremely few options after that did not pan out. I did get the offer though, but now the serious thought about doing it is back again, and this time there is nothing beyond the horizon. I am miserable. I do not enjoy life and I do not think I have ever seriously enjoyed it. I cannot see anything happening that would change my mind. I have thought about this for as long as I can remember. My earliest memories have been about being depressed and anxious, being unhappy, being uncomfortable, being generally confused and not knowing what I actually want out of life. Just living in a constant state of apathy.Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Whatever few things I had have vanished into thin air. Society does not care. People do not care. I am all alone. I cannot handle demands and expectations. I cannot take control of my own life. I do not have a direction. I do not have any goals, I never did. The closest thing is probably where I am right now, and feeling the way I feel it does not really cut it. I have absolutley zero skills, I am shockingly unintelligent, I have no passions or real actual interests. I am only consuming and have never produced anything in my entire life.If I am nothing, if I do not want anything, if I cannot do anything - then literally becoming nothing should be the most reasonable outcome of all this and sparing the world of my useless and parasitical ways.I have stuck on what I think (and hope) is the most peaceful method with the resources I can attain. So the question is when it is going to happen. I am strongly considering awaiting my inevitable firing - that is probably the most common circumstance is not it? Livelihood, making a living - the thing I cannot handle. We live in a giant market and if you cannot fit into the market you do not have any worth whatsoever.So I am freeing up valuable resources that I am hoarding. Because I am going to die anyway and if I do not enjoy my time living, I might as well speed up the process.I had some idea about getting some travelling done before I bite the bullet, but I have a hard time imagining what would even give me the slightest sense of excitement by doing that. So I might as well save that money that will be going to a more productive and useful member of society. I have decided that it is going to happen and how I am going to do it. The question now is when it is going to happen.",1
Yep. Tonight. Tonight,1
"Title pretty much explains it all. I am going to have to repeat 1 or 2 more years of high school and the thought of that makes me want to slit my own fucking throat. Because of this pandemic and my lazy ass, my grades have gone completely down the toilet. I also do not have a job, or a drivers license, which is pretty fucking pathetic. And before you say it gets better in college! I am too fucking poor to get into any type of decent college. And even i was able to, id probably just end up flunking out or killing myself anyways, so it does not really matter. I have already fucked up my life at 17 and honestly i deserve it. I let it get this bad and its all just going to go downhill from here. I am a fuck up",1
"I thought finding my job and avoiding being unemployed would help with my suicidal thoughts, but this job has made them so much fucking worse. I feel like I would rather fucking die tonight than work another week there I am so fucking anxious all the time and I fucking hate going to work every morning",1
"As embarrassing as it is for me to ask this, I want to know. Sometimes I feel like I am suffering from depression but I do not know for sure How do you know if you have depression?",0
"Hello, I have decided to not kill myself today, and I am going to keep track of the things I have done since. I have got enough time to prove myself right, hopefully its not wasted. I am going to continue to write out my days warts &amp; all until I feel like my life is worth living or if I decide otherwise. Hope whoever is reading this comes along the journey, I just do not want to feel alone anymore. Day #1 07/20/2021 3:11AM CST",1
"People talk about the morality of killing yourself, of the pain you leave behind for those that love you. They talk about religious implications, and of the pain of different methods of suicide. They talk about the regret of not being able to achieve your goals in life if you are dead, as if my ten year plan would matter at all to my corpse. But none of that is why I am still here, positive or negative, it does not inform my decision. I am here because of the terror of waking up in the hospital the morning after my ""attempt at self harm."" The fear that in by trying to end the pain of life I will make my situation that much worse. Unable to use my hands because I slashed through my tendons? Unable to speak or control simple motor functions because of the brain damage from lack of oxygen? Paralyzed or comatose, or with a giant crater in my head from a bullet that just could not quite get the job done? Did you know that suicide by shooting yourself in the head only has an 82% chance of succeeding? Scariest fact I have learned in a while. Fear of Failure, that is what is keeping me on my feet today. But there is always tomorrow. Fear of failure",1
I am praying for death on my way to work Time for another soul stealing day to do shit I do not care about,0
welp I do not know what to do noweverything in my life has gone to shitand now I am all alone and i hate it sudden huge wave of depression coming through... and I am alone. Again.,1
"After sending myself to the ER twice in two weeks because of panic attacks and loosing my therapist I am starting to loose hope. Sleeping on a broken air mattress in a living room to work 9-4 six days a week makes me exhausted. There are hardwood floors and the roommates dog's nails click profusely, waking me up when they walk or sleep kick the floor. My therapist stopped talking to me, it is been eight weeks. I am alone besides cooking in my own prep area in the kitchen, other cooks are around me but we are too busy to talk. I feel so alone and I am doing out of control.I have even come to the point to the muscles in my arms hurt from how much I tense them. I want a long hug or a snuggle...to be warm, happy, and in good arms sounds wonderful. I really need a hug",0
Is jumping of to a coming train a selfish way to end your life? Train jump,1
"I have one or two people I can talk to and rely on and neither live close by, and one is probably going to reach their limit of dealing w/me soon after months of near constant contact. My family and I are on good terms but they are toxic and borderline abusive at times. My husband and I are separated and probably divorcing after he exhibited some abusive behavior that reenacted a previous trauma of mine and sent me into a ptsd hellscape. I cannot function anymore. I do not want to be here. No one really wants me here and those that do only want me at a distance or if I allow them to mistreat me. Truly, the more I think about it the more I realize I have very little holding me back. it is about time to go, I just have to figure out how. Also, question: How much detail should I include in my note? Do I detail the exact reasons why I am doing this or keep it simple? I want people to understand that no one is to blame and I know they tried to help me. I do not want to because secondary trauma by detailing the assaults and depressive episodes leading up to my suicide but I also do not want anyone to blame themselves. I cannot survive on my own [and a q about leaving a note]",1
"somehow everybody thinks I am doing better but in reality my depression is worse than ever. nobody bothers checking in because look normal, but it feels like I am not going to survive much longer. I am doing worse than ever but this time I am alone",0
just poisoned myself. I am scared. But if I am lucky i will not be scared ever again. Idk if it was enough tho. just poisoned myself,1

"A combination of fish oil and antidepressants reduced the amount of suicidal thoughts that I experience. However I still doubt than keeping alive is the best course of action. Since 2015 I am battling mental illness, and it is an uphill battle to experience so much apathy and abulia/avolition.I feel like a vegetable, I eat because my mom prepares me food, otherwise I do not know if I would eat. I am 37 and I used to be healthy. I have known the good life, and this is not it. My life seems complete at this point, and why not to go already?Getting older like this seems like a burden. I just hope to save up at least 10k EUR for euthanasia in Switzerland, just in case. Sometimes I try to come up with reasons to stay alive, but I do not enjoy being alive any longer, each day is like a grind, and I wonder what to keep living for.On the other hand, I am still fascinated that I am alive. Like, it is very weird to be able to exist, and have a body, and talk with other beings over internet... Less suicidal thoughts. Death still sounds blissful",1
"I could have had between $50,000 - $250,000 if I was not so goddamn stupid. Instead I ended up chasing that money and lost half of my life savings. I have nothing else in my life and that money was going to allow me to move out of my parents home, return to college and further my career, and actually gain some self-confidence for once I am my life. Instead all of that is gone and I am stuck working my dead end job. I do not think I have the strength to continue going on all alone in this world being such a loser. I cannot spend years of my life working toward where I already could have been if I was not such a fucking idiot. I want to get a gun, get wasted, and shoot myself in the head as I jump off a cliff to my death.",1
"I just fucking hate myself, life is a living hell, mirrors are ugly, and i am too, i feel like black ink is spreading through my brain and i cannot stop it, i get a teensy bit jealous and then have a sudden breakdown because i feel horrible and stupid and spoiled,i ruined my life, i cannot fix it, if i was braver i would be dead, thank you fear, but genuinely kill me in a brutal,slow death. Please. Sorry I am here again",0

"First I am going to present you with a few questions that you can answer on your own. After I will provide you with what I went through, before I begin, I would like to tell you have severe PTSD but no depression.1) Why are you sad kind soul? Are you not loved? Do you not have a single person in your life who cares so much about you and dislikes reverently to see you upset?2) Why are you allowing other peoples actions and choices to dictate how you feel? Do you not realize the control you have given them over your mind, heart, and choices that only you have the ability to dictate action you make? 7+ billion people in the world and 1 person who you thought cared about you but has proven beyond reasonable doubt they do not, so why do you care what a fraction of a penny to a million dollars thinks?This is why I cannot rationalize depression. Who gives a damn what other people think about you? Not when there is so many people you have yet to meet and get to know who would give their life freely to save your own. Not everyone is this way, why allow people to turn you away from love of someone you never met? Do you not allow them to win at this point in time? Is that not laying down and accepting defeat in every measure. You have given them control over who you are. Break free of it, some people are truly evil scum and this is what they want. They want you to feel worthless, how many people right now can ask a friend this: ""Hey, I feel alone can I talk?"" Personally I do not have it but with online friendships and a few real-life friends. I went from being known in all of California, to being hated by everyone because of slander. So instead of giving up, get back up, do not stop that drive in you to be kind. Suicide is not a answer to any form or self pity, self loathing, or self hatred. Killing yourself will only hurt those who truly care about you. If you die can you share your story? NO! You damn well cannot, so instead of realizing that struggle is growth and growing from a mistake, whether it be from how you may have treated innocent people when you were down and out, or maybe it was how you were treated when you needed a shoulder to cry on? Indifference is not the answer, YOU ARE LOVED BY SOMEONE! PAST, PRESENT, OR FURTURE TENSE! Remember you could be a drive to someone later, a story that if you quit on or recluse on that you have already that that which plagues you win. Life is not easy, let me share 11 years of my life, I know from personal experience that life is difficult. Yet, I refuse to give up, mama did not raise no bitch or a quitter.Sept 17th 2012, prior to that date someone who was called a friend but proven he was not used my name to put a MS13 member in jail facing 1000's of felony charges. That person was facing LIFE in prison without the possibility of parole. I did not know about the hit on my name. A hit is a contract to kill someone. On the above mentioned date, I was overdosing on 26 drugs, Four times the lethal limit. I also had enough acid in my system to because that test result to come back beyond Blood Red. I blew a 3.14 Bac level. The people who did it went against a description to attempt to kill me. I had calico hair and brown eyes, olive skin tone. The description was a white ginger kid with blues eye. They kid napped me and attacked me repeatedly. Well my advise to all, if you want someone unconscious or cooperative why in the hell would it be a good idea to drug them with PCP? In short, I did not feel a thing. They eventually put a gun to my head after three horrific failure attempts to knock me out. Me being me and with who I know told them to "" Do it"". I had them call my closest friends so I knew that in killing me that everyone there would be dead with me. I presented them with this logic, they put the gun back down and decided to try their luck with punches again. Every time they had turned around prior I was being fed information, this time I did not wait I had what I needed. I allowed wrath to hit my voice, they trembled, as the passenger reached for the gun I hit him hard enough to put him in a coma for 7 days. I turned to the driver and present him with two options: drive me to the town near where I lived, OR I will beat you down to a pulp. From knowledge prior that night I knew he had a gun in his door panel (never brag about where you keep loaded guns). He repeatedly kept saying ""OK! OK! I will do it as he reached for the gun and I could see it plain as day. That second the his hand touched the gun I hit with with everything I had. I shattered his right side of his jaw to such a extreme he had to go into surgery to get it fixed. I laid back and felt sick, I am not a fan of harming people and at that point I was exhausted. Thankfully I hit him hard enough that I was able to rest for fifteen minutes and eventually stumble out of the car and run. I came across a Navy personnel who was driving down the road. I ran into of him and screamed for help. Finally, he got out and he said ""what is wrong, what happened?"" I was so exhausted and afraid I could barely tell him. When I managed to he dialed 911. I was taken to the hospital, It took 8 hours with NO Narcan to get it out of my system. I used the restroom twice, had a bottle of Gatorade and a bottle of water to drink. I was not allowed to sleep. I was in psychosomatic state of mind and was not hallucinating prior to being there. When my urine analysis came back I was informed and it hit like a ton of bricks. Walls melted and shifted violently, the floor rose up like ocean waves, I just wanted to be home. I was alone and afraid, no use of my phone was allowed or any phone for that matter. When I talked to the detective in charge of handling the case, I was threatened with if the person I put into a coma died I would face man slaughter charges, that I should be happy that I was not being charged with assault and battery on the person who is jaw I broke, I was still tripping. I pointed out the fact that the evidence gathered from that vehicles dash cam proved it was self-defense.. I got a response of "" I do not care"". Funny because I am 7.4% Balkan and 14.9% Scandinavian. When I told her that she did not like it and said we shall see about that. In the end the case was thrown into a incinerator, all because I could not bring them to the point of kidnapping. Yet, we have tech that allows us to trace cellphone signals.. I told her my number and she refused to it. I gave her names of everyone there, told her to call Netherland's spec ops who were there to protect me, nothing was done... I told her to her face this ""You are a Cunt, you are a corrupt piece of trash and that I would stop at nothing until I had everyone even remotely affiliated with what had happened dead before a firing squad, even swore to God"".... Well people who know me know I keep promises, especially to God. I finally have called everything into question, now its time for hellfire and brimstone. I should be depressed, I should have so many issues and I truly thank God for getting me through it. Believe in what you want its your choice. This is a factual story and really did happen. It is not all I went through. 11 years of my life dedicated to hunting everyone even remotely affiliated, the more I found out the sicker to my stomach it made me. Raped and child molestation, direct connections to the Federal Government. I never thought for a second it would be that deep. I had no real clue as the truth of how far the rabbit hole went down. I went to the bottom, and came back up. Never allow anyone to change who you are, You are far more valuable when you have respect and love then to become like them. The only way people will ever beat you is when you give into what THEY want. YouTube aggressive motivational speech, picture of a Lion. I helped write it and spoke my piece. Something I feel needs to be shared",0
"I have problems with hormones and I could not get my meds for 2 weeks. I am still waiting for my prescription...Now I want to take everything I have in my medical cabinet to just dissappear and leave a note to everyone that loves me ""do not blame yourself"".I hate that feeling, and I am still waiting for another symptoms like migraine every day. I would never wish that on my worse enemy. I have a job, I have amazing partner, loving family, two lovely cats... why I am afraid of living? Why I want to dissappear so fucking much? I know I will get my meds, but right now feels like hell and I want to escape it as soon as possible. Hormones causing depression",0
"I have OCD, depression and social phobia. I spent a lot of time undergoing treatment with a psychologist and psychiatrist and I improved a lot, the pandemic started and money was running out. I did not see my psychologist for a long time. Now, I saw her again for less than 1 month, I am only doing 2 sessions a month, the money is enough for that, and it is been 5 months since I have talked to my psychiatrist. My case is serious, I think about suicide, self-mutilation, etc. almost every day. I really like it when I am with my psychologist, she helps me a lot, I wish I could see her twice a week, but the money is not enough, I also miss my psychiatrist a lot (he already saved my life).I live in a third world country with no hope of getting a job. You might think ""you could switch to someone who does social price"", no, that would completely destroy my treatment, I do not know how to live without my psychiatrist and starting with a new psychologist would s****, because I have known her for 5 years. I just wish I could have a little income to pay more sessions, and yeah I already have discount (live in Brazil really sucks) Idk what title put, that is my situation",1
"having the strongest desire to kill myself but I am too sad and down to do everything that I said I would do before killing myself...packing up my stuff, writing all my notes, paying off all debt. so i know i cannot kill myself. but i also do not want to be hospitalized. that was a fucking nightmare and id rather be dead than be in the hospital again. feeling stuck and alone and this is the only place i can be honest with my feelings without getting assessed for suicide Feeling trapped",1

"My feel like I have been through hell and back today and I do not know I feel like I want to commit suicide or anything I just cannot keep it up please somebody talk to me. I have been feeling so much suicidal lately, so many side effects from the medication and I feel so alone please somebody talk to me",1
"I am 19 years old, I live in Texas I have honestly been wanting to end it all since I was 12, but every attempt I take and everything I do never goes expected, I do not want to be here I have an selfish family not only that I feel like no one wants to see me succeed, my mom does not talk to me she is too happy building her dream family, I do not talk to my siblings because they do not care, and they have showed me that with actions, and situations they have put me in, my grandparents own 4 cars and will not let me drive any one of them so I can get a job, I also make music and that is my only happy place but I still do not know what to do, I have been alone my whole life and at this point it hurts more then ever, I have nothing, nothing to live for only thing I want is my baby sister to have a great life, more so Ill become famous then kill myself its better that way, I just had to vent maybe someone will try to bring me out my she will, maybe I need friends but I cannot trust anyone I have been fucked over too many times, maybe I am meant to be alone. I just need love/someone to talk to",1
"the chicken or the egg. For me it feels like the divorce. As she was the only person on this entire earth aside from my long dead parents that actually loved me. Its very easy for people who have people that love them, tell people who could disapear without a trace that ""they matter"". No F%@\* you. Just F$#% you. If your someone who tells people they matter who are not loved, you do not get it. Your scum. You encourage suffering is all you do. Leave the suicidal alone and let them die. Let them out of their misery. Your guilt tripping is worse than noose. and (to be honest I do not think I would have a funeral) like literally it might be days or weeks until a next of kin is even notified. The first next of kin is incoherant and brain dead too so that will go over well. Anyways, from 2010-2020, seven (7) close family members croaked. The deaths became so common mixed with my divorce by the end I did not even cry. My nightmare is when I wake up, my life is when I dream. Literally. My nightmares are so pleasant because I am actually back as my old self before all the dying, and the divorce, and the emptiness and being left with nothing, or nobody. I coped with the divorce by eating myself into obesity so reproductive prospects are gone making a second marriage an impossibility. Its simply over. I have fought it, I have held on for miracles, but none are coming. I am going to blow my brains out soon. The first time I was too scared. But the next time I will not back down. I have no friends. I have been homeless for 2 years because I literally do not care. I am homeless because that is where I belong. If someone would pass me a gun right now id make abstract art on the wall with it. Life is not precious. Its merely something lucky people get when they have social capital. If you have nothing, there is no reason. Reason is someone saying ""I love you"" and Actually meaning it. Sure lots of the guilt trippers will drop their Jesus Bros or Love yourself Bro, or some other meaningless slogan or irrelevant commentary. Cya on the otherside. Decided",1
"really wish i could talk to someone but my best friend is the reason I am so sad. i got my life fucked and flipped over 5 years ago and I have just been picking up pieces ever since. I am in therapy three times a week I am on drugs that are meant for war veterans and every meaningful person in my life i have effectively pushed them away. no good excuse besides being ruled by trauma and not being able to cope effectively. i see my last lifeline just kind of living and having a good time and being present and I am so jealous its hard to talk to her at all. I am so behind I am never going to make it to where everyone else is. I have attempted twice and idk why i have to be alive. why do i have to be here. i just try to make it through every day i do not have purpose. i can hardly feed myself. everyone else is making strides in their lives and moving to new cities and jobs and everything. I have been stagnant for 5 years. I am 23. my life got fucked at 18 and I am mentally still fucking there. because i cannot get away from my thoughts man. 6 mental diagnosis later and i just cannot do this shit anymore. I am tired of seeing people have all of the things i so desperately want. it comes to everyone else so fucking easily. i get how people say ""no do not die you have sm to live for you are so young"" ya ok that does not apply to me. i do not have so much to live for. i have no desire to continue because i am never going to fucking catch up. i do not want the life i live. i do not want the things that have happened in my life. i did not ask to fucking be here. i just take up resources that could be better used with people who have lives worth living or at least passion and drive. the only future i see for myself is in the fucking ground within the next few months. the life expectancy for my illnesses is 39-42 anyways. oh by suicide if you were curious. BECAUSE NOBODY WITH MY FUCKING BRAIN WOULD EVER WANT TO BE ALIVE I GUARANTEE IT. just not doing the best",1
"Being 'loved' or 'cared for' is just a giant sham. All that means is that people are going to manipulate you, hurt you, disappoint you, trash you, fuck you over, and I cannot do it anymore. I do not want any friends, not a boyfriend, I just want to be totally alone. Everyone that claims to 'love me' just manipulates me and wants me to be their doormat to walk all over. An interaction with someone has a 50/50 shot at making me feel totally either suicidal, socially anxious, or severely depressed. Rarely do I walk away from a social experience saying ""wow that was fun / wow that made me feel great about myself! / wow I feel so loved and appreciated."" Ironically if I just set some boundaries and stand up for myself for once I am sure they will all just leave me on their own anyways. I do not want any kind of relationship anymore.",1

"I have CPTSD from childhood abuse. My ex abused me and hit me. My current relationship,I love him and he has anger issues due to his bipolar. He laid into me today about how he is become my caretaker because of how low energy I have become due to my depression. I do not want to be this way. I feel so embarrassed, ridiculed and ashamed. He said he will not seek out therapy because he said therapy is pointless to pursue and pay for when the reason for his anger is me. I am causing it. I caused it all. How could I not? How could I make this many people angry in my life and not be the because of it? I am the common denominator and I would be doing the world a favor by leaving it is all my fault",1

Get real.I do not like life, I do not have any hobbies and I have my reasons. People should stop telling me I am depressed and that I should see a therapist. do not guilt-trip me. there is nothing wrong with me. Accept different opinions. I do not have depression.",0

"I usually just lurk here but fuck has being isolated in my room recently been rough. I have no one to talk to and I just want to end this stress. My dam stomach is churning and tight as hell from this stress. I want friends but I do not have any social skills and am scared that I will lose them like I always do. Jesus 24 years of this shit is long enough, cannot I just end it and find my peace in oblivion? But I have my mom's feelings to worry about. Despite not talking much with her I do consider her the one person in my corner. Still, I just want to die and disappear. I do not belong here or anywhere else. Things will be set right when I am gone. Until then I just have to keep going step by step. Feeling the pressure",1
"You need to love yourself, sincerely. Stop depending on others for what you can provide. Once you do, the pain is experienced differently. Feel the 'negative' energy and welcome it with open arms. Let it stay as long as it wants, It does not harm you, but you harm yourself trying to get rid of it. If there are times when negative thoughts of interactions flood your mind accept that your harsh judgement could be correct. You might have done something stupid. You may have been awkward. It only matters if you say it does. Without your consent, nobody can define what is 'good' in your existence. that is your power.When you depend on others for your image and worth, you have to constantly change yourself to fit their definition of good. You trade your life for the affection of another and they have no idea what they are doing here. It becomes the blind leading the blind. Spend time with yourself. Not watching tv or reading a book. Stand up and slowly move your toes, bend your knees slightly and flex your lower body. Feel what it is like to let your muscles take the pressure off your bones. Turn on some music and allow the connection between sound and touch to go unfiltered. Make up your own vocals. Let the blood and oxygen flow and your nerves come alive. Hear what they say.Many abuse their bodies, treating it like a slave to their will. it is a foundational part of existence. Spend time with it and it will enhance your experience. When lying in bed, shut everything off and slowly curly your hands and toes. Tense them in the motion. Feel each movement. This is it. This is your experience of existence. Grab each second of it and appreciate it. If you believe you could create a better one, you have the power to do so. The rules of meaning and purpose are all written in your mind. If it is difficult, use that knowledge to empathize with existence. it is malleable, but it is not going to shape itself to your will. You need to connect with it. Not with the voices of others, with yourself. You. You exist. you are incredible. do not let anyone lie to you and if they are telling you their truth, then know that they do not see what this is. Please understand (sincere love)",0
When i was 12 i told myself that when I am 18 years old I am going to kill myself but now I am will not kill me until my caretaker loses his responsibility for me so they cannot get the punishment for my death..i think this is possible when I am 20 so i got 3 years to liv now. Only 3 years,1
Its hurting so much. i feel like doing something self-destructive. i cannot be hospitalized cos its embarrassing and my mom's not in town; last time also i was hospitalized when my mom was not in town. when my mom's in town she does not want me hospitalized and talks me out of going to the hospital or calling the suicide helpline. but she is not here to do that and i do not know what to do. its too much in my head. its torture. let me out.,1
I will donate all my blood if this is possible Good strategy,1

"I would rather just not feel anything instead. Does that make sense? It makes sense in my head but not when I am saying it out loud. Everyone is looking to be happy right? To be happy and find things that make you happy. I thought I wanted to be happy, turns out it is a scam lol. I do not want to be happy, I just want to spend the rest of my days thinking about how peaceful it must be when I am dead. I am scared of getting happy because I know I will spend the few days after feeling completely like crap.",0

Anyway lately i feel like my symptoms and beginning to get worse for the absolute life of me i cannot tell my friend because I am scared of what she would say and judge me. Anyway she started being like go out ur selfish for staying in i made shitty excuses like I am getting a new phone, I am visiting my family, I am tired you know. And she sent me a massive paragraph about how selfish i am for not being able to go to college with her and how I am lazy and selfish for not going out like hun you know i deal with a severe mental illness. Anyway this might seem little but i literally have no friends irl because of this like one called me a psycho a few weeks ago and they all think I am crazy i hate it sm.

"I have been in a depressive haze for like a year. (Smoking too much pot every single day is not a great idea!) I had a family member get cancer around the beginning of COVID and it kind of broke me. I was going to therapy and taking meds for a while but neither of those are happening anymore. I have isolated myself from my old friends for so long. I do not even know if they would want to hear from me. I live with my parents, I am unemployed, I have let my bedroom become a huge mess, and now I am 99% sure there is a cockroach nest under my bed.

"I have an appointment with a GP tomorrow, however just want some opinions.I weaned off my antidepressants, maybe 6 - 8 weeks ago without supervision and it is been awful, physically and mentally. After a tipping point last night, I have decided to go back on the meds. I have tried my best to wait it out but I cannot keep this up. I was on desvenlaflaxine (generic Pristq) 150mg, which is a higher dose for this med. Should I go back to 150mg? Or start from scratch at 50mg? Or meet in the middle at 100mg?Thank you in advance.(I know I should not have weaned off on my own but my GPs (plural, I have seen multiple) understanding of mental health treatments are basic at best and I thought I could manage it myself. I was wrong. Moving on now). Restarting anti-depressants, start with lower dose?",0

Fortunately I did not get in an accident but I was damn near close.

I feel that life for me has no consequences and I continue to be self destructive.I have experienced lots of emotional abuse in my upbringing and throughout my life and I cannot ever think calmly and practically because I feel like everyone is breathing down my neck.

"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",0
"News flash, it does not. I tried attempting suicide in September 2020 and I remember waking up in the A&amp;E crying my eyes out, telling the doctors why did I have to wake up when I was finally at peace. The doctors hardly cared, they just told me to 'move on' and said things like 'so that is why you are killing yourself?' and invalidated my emotions and struggles since I was a child. it is July 2021 and I still wish I never woke up. All my friends ended up cutting ties with me, my own family keeps hitting me and telling me they give up on taking care of me because I am a lost because. My mother has still refused to talk to me and plans to send me to an asylum because she does not want any responsibility of me anymore. And that is when I calmed down. I calmed down because I have nothing else to lose and I truly do not have to worry about anymore what ifs. This is it. I finally stopped crying because I finally made up my mind and I feel so at peace with it. The biggest lie anyone told me is that things will get better",1

"Made homemade burritos for the first time in a long time. I had it all planned out and my kitchen gets super hot so I was sweating the whole time. Only to find at the end, my skillet is too shallow to strain the grease from the beef which that must have been some REALLY high fat meat. It did not dawn on me until about 5 minutes ago I could have just used a paper towel to strain off the grease.The nacho cheese sauce I decided to buy ended up overpowering my seasonings and completely overshadowed everything except the oil in the beef.So you could not taste the baby spinach, the rice, the tomatoes, the onion, nothing. Just nacho cheese sauce and oil. It was not bad, but it really made me feel incompetent. You know, I have been studying and studying on how to cook and season stuff properly and what seasons work well with others. Like for this, it was onion powder, chili powder, ground cumin and salt and pepper. could not taste any of it.For the refried beans, I also got some green chili sauce with lime, figuring it would really jazz up the flavors in the beef as you bit down. Topped with the rice, nacho cheese sauce, Colby cheese shredded, tomatoes and baby spinach on top to keep it away from the heat so it would not wilt and get that sort of really strong iron taste.I put a LOT of thought into this and it just ends up turning out meh. It was barely distinguishable from the likes of Taco Bell. I sweat my ass off in that kitchen and I put in all that work for that...it is depressing to me, i know that may be stupid but I genuinely tried. I have got a few lessons from it though so, I might try it again in the future. But for now it just kind of sits in my head and my fridge because it is just bleh Ick...",0

I stay in my room every day for most of the day, not talking to anyone except for my dad who I live with from time to time.

"I have suffered from reccurent abdominal pain for years, and it has steadily gotten worse. It wakes me up every night so that I only get 2-3 hours of sleep. Ill spend the rest of the day in a zombie like trance, too tired to focus and too in pain to rest. I pay almost 300 dollars a month in health insurance but I cannot afford to have this fixed. To get the initial procedures done to diagnose my condition it will cost at least $8000. that is not including the actual surgery, follow up treatment, and medication. that is basically all the money I have in the world. On top of that, my work performance has been declining along with my health. I just found out that my work is training someone to take my position. So even if I paid for the procedures I will still likely lose my shitty job, which is still the only job I have ever had that has allowed me to save any amount of money in my 30 years of life. I can only save about 200-300 a month with my current job, which I have only had for a year. Before that I lived hand to mouth since I was 18. I had hoped I could spend the meager amount of money I have saved on supporting myself while I went to college, so I could get a better job, so I could afford to pay for things like surgery. On top of all this, my car, which took me 4 years to save up for, has broken down, leaving me without transportation to find a new job. Its like a bad movie with no real lesson at the end. The pain from my condition has affected everything from my work to my relationships to my personal fulfillment. I cannot go out with my few friends to enjoy life, or meet new people, because i am always lethargic and struggling with pain, not to mention my appearance has become ghoulish as years of lack of sleep have caught up with me, driving away any new potential friends. I do not want to die but I am so tired. All I want to do is go to sleep. I am sick and there is nothing I can do to fix it.",0
"I am 23. A college graduate (continuing education). I have struggled with depression for about 13 years now and with body image for a few years now. Recently I have been in a rut. A deep rut that feels like I will not ever get out of. Most days I repeatedly play things over in my head and think about suicide. I am so incredibly lonely. I do not know what to do with myself most of the time. I take antidepressants. See a therapist. But honestly everything feels hopeless. Like a waste of time and money. As a male I find it hard to talk to people about my feelings out of fear of scaring people off. I tried to find hobbies and dating has been nonexistent. I constantly tell myself I am not good enough, this stemmed from my ex telling me that I am too awkward to find someone as well as comparing my lack of physical attractiveness to other guys. I am honestly at a point where I do not want to go on any longer. It would crush my family but I honestly think at this point that not being here would be more beneficial and less emotionally taxing on them than me constantly giving off a depressing vibe. I could go on but I do not want to sound like a broken record so that is where Ill end this post. All I can think about is depression",0

One option is to carry on and someday, hopefully, make it out of here, and the other is to give up. And I am so tired and fed up that giving up is looking ever more appealing than dragging myself out of bed everyday for the same things to happen to me. I try so hard to be good enough for my family, but its never enough. When my dad starts drinking hes the worst person you will ever meet, he gets angry and argumentative and abusive, and my brother is like that without the alcohol. Mum is never around, and most of the work gets left to me, but there is always something I have not done or something I could have done better. I just think its enough, I am tired and I cannot see an end where I am still around. I am not okay",0
Why is it so expensive to seek help? I am broke at the moment and I do not have health insurance for another month. I keep thinking about getting the help I need but I literally cannot. Killing myself is the most cost effective way of dealing with how I feel. How fucked up is that? Closer than ever. Planning to do it tonight.,1
"I am a very average person, everyone around me is above par in whatever they do, I am no match in front of them also I am a very toxic person, I pushed all my school friends away and I am pulling my current friends down into that same hole. i am affirmative to have a very bad influence on them, I am lazy, arrogant and take people for granted, last night i was playing with my brother and somehow I kept sabotaging the team .i am the most useless person in the entire world and virtual world. The best part is I have no trauma to act as a foundation for my behavior I am just a horrible person. I am still manage to wake up every day go to work behave nicely but you know what I do not want to do it anymore. I just think the world would be better off without me,",0

"Every time something hopeful happens I fuck it up because I am me, I am the problem, not bad luck, not lack of opportunity. Just me as a person. I just want to stop wanting to die and with every passing day and every crushing disappointment it feels more and more like suicide is the answer to that. This has been YEARS. I have done the right things. I have spoken to people. This past few months I have made so many positive changes in a desperate bid to survive but I need to draw a line somewhere. Enough is enough. I really think I am done. The only real sense peace, joy, or happiness I get anymore is when I fantasise about leaving this world. there is nothing left for me here. I know I need to go but its terrifying. Nobody knows what happens when you die but I have heard a lot of recounts of people who nearly died who say it is peaceful and that is what I am trying to cling on to now. I cannot deal with the crushing loneliness, rejection, the lack of affection or appreciation. That seems to come to some people so naturally. I figured out a pretty sure method - been saving my extra medication up for long enough to hopefully have enough to really shut myself down. But frustratingly that part of me that is still scared of the unknown is stopping things. I do not want to live in limbo anymore - I either want to live a proper life, or I just want to fucking die. I have tried so hard at option number one. Please believe me I have. I guess I am here looking for a reason to live or a reason to die. Drag me up or push me over the edge. Just do not make me sit on this stupid fence any more. Oh, just stay a bit longer, see what happens!!. What about when you have already done that? Getting closer every day",1

"A common misconception about depression that I feel like does not get talked about much is that just because we can do something one day, does not mean we can the next.Just because I could shower yesterday, does not mean I can today.Just because I left the house last week, does not mean I can this week.Just because I talked to you earlier, does not mean I am in the mood now.Just because some days I am not thinking about death, does not mean the days when I do make life exhausting.Just because I had motivation, does not mean I still do.Depression is not this straight line, some days may be better than others. Motivation can come &amp; go, do not let your lows or highs define what you are &amp; are not capable of. Your best today will not always be the same as yesterday's best, that does not mean you are not 'trying your best.' One day you can, the next you cannot.",0
Anyone else feel the same? I am from Malaysia btw I hate my own country.,0
the pain. the pain is unbearable and its not even physical pain. it feels like I am so far from being happy. I am 16 and my life is already a shit hole. i hate it here so much. i hate my life and i want to die so badly. i guess this is a cry for help. i have no one and nothing. i have a bottle of pills here to take. idk if its enough to kill me but it does not hurt to try right. does it ever stop?,1

I am a mental health nurse. I should be strong and healthy. But I am not coping. I do not think I have anything else to give. One of my patients told me she was jealous of my happyness. Iv gotten so good a faking it. I have no happiness left but I am too terrified of anyone finding out.I over think everything and everyone. I hate myself. Everything about myself. I need help but I am too embarrassed to go. Then I hate myself more and feel ashamed of how pathetic I am.I have alopecia that started from a particularly bad year. A break up and broken nose from a patient amongst other things.I am tired. I want to see people and I want to be alone. I feel bad whatever I do.I am so tired. I do not think I can cope.,0
I just graduated and I cannot find a job. My family treats me like shit I am always hiding in my room. I always eat by myself when no one is home. My childhood was mess now they deny that they never treated me bad or hit me. They act like they were good parents but its all lies. I do not know how to drive or have a drivers license I was sick most of the time and I am also nervous to drive because I disassociate a lot I block out everything. Sometimes I wish I could win the lottery and go far away from them and never have to see them again in my life. I have a bf but I am in a long distance relationship he is the only one that makes me happy even to this day even if they do not say it I know they do not want me here. The only reason they do not want me dead is because they do not want to pay for the funeral that is what my dad told me. Honestly idk why they brought me into this world if they never wanted me to begin with. Out of all my siblings I am the one who had to take all of their shit and they took it out on me My family is toxic,0

I was born without asking yet I am supposed to live a life deprived from the things I want. I am pretty sure life could be awesome but without money its just impossible. It brought lots of other problems for my life. I wake up every day wishing I did not. Hopefully death comes as soon as possible and I hope to never be back to this life again. Unless I come back as a wealthy guy from an even wealthier family. Waking up every day is my biggest challenge cuz I wish I was dead.",1
The chances that someone will support you is very low. Who knows the number of people who have ended their lives on here and posted here multiple times? This is all a lie. do not promise something you cannot give to people. You cannot say you will get support when the majority of the time it is hard for even one person to notice you and the one person that does is completely clueless of what you are saying. This is not peer support.,1

"I just cannot take it I been pushed around mental health services being lied to and having my rights violated that certain actions were performed,When they have not such as being told I went to a and e because I liked the attention also not having after care when I was Discharge from cahms, having to wait 4 months before even referred, to the adult team, and having to wait 3 more months to wait.And being told after a particularly bad episode by the acute mental health team that I should just stop drinking, then I was told that a consultant psychiatrist would decide whether I should sectioned but never heard back Then I was just dumped with more medication, and having to be visited by the crisis team that I should just distract myself and just expected until to wait for threapy If I could anything without consequences I would fucking kill every single one of them condescending bustards, for not giving me proper mental health care and expected to be cool with it The layer stopping me from killing myself is pain, cannot stand being pushed around at different parts of the nhs and expected to be ok and deal with it",1

"I am not really sure if this is normal or what, but literally all I can ever seem to think about is how useless I am. I think it is slowly making me go crazy, or something. I am already so insecure and all the people around me seem to be so much more intelligent than I am. I used to be smart, but around a few years ago, everything just started to feel less and less real, and so I just had much less incentive to care, and so less reasons to find things to think deeply about. Now, all I can think about is how much more everyone else around me has accomplished. I genuinely do not understand how people think normally on a day-to-day basis. Is this normal, and am I just making it a bigger deal than it actually is? Regardless of what I am doing, somehow I always find a way to feel terrible about myself about it. Like, for example, if I am watching a show, I will feel like I am not ""enjoying it right"", and that I am interpreting the show wrong and that I am not enjoying it in the same way everyone else is. I do not know if this is normal or not. I have been like this so long that I do not know anymore All I can think about 24/7 is how useless I am",0
"I generally wake up extremely anxious and hopeless. As the day goes on, it tends to get better, but I still have extreme waves/bouts of hopelessness and sadness that hit me like a truck. It makes me feel sick and occurs at random. Always cannot help but feel something is physically wrong with me despite negative blood work and MRI. Does the severity of your depression fluctuate throughout the day?",0
"I work for enterprise and I just had to pick up a customer. She put her mask on, so I thought ""okay she is still being cautious of covid"". I drop her off at the office and I go in to see her mask hanging from one year standing as close as we were in the car with my co worker. She eventually took it off completely. This makes me feel major depression. I believe I am ugly and others think so too. I have had hook ups with girls before, but believe I have never dated anyone because I am ugly, that and my personality is not good maybe. Is it just me or was she being biased/ judgemental towards me for no reason? Treated different than others?",0
"I apologize for such a long post, and I recognize that this may have been better in r/vent.it is just that all the time it is like I have a voice in my head telling me to just kill myself (not an actual voice, I do not hear voices that are not there). It feels redundant and pointless to say it, but yeah I have very serious depression. I had a therapist until May when my college closed, and I sought one earlier in the summer but kept getting anxiety about scheduling appointments. I have also tried getting a summer job but that is taken way longer than I would hoped. I did not want to schedule therapy which would conflict with my work schedule, so I was waiting till my work schedule was settled, but I still have not even done orientation yet. I am just so anxious about whether so many things will work out that I just freeze and wait for them not to. I am on Lexapro and while that was incredibly helpful a year ago, it does not feel like it is doing anything at all, maybe it is that I take it at a different time each day (late in the day too, I do not have the willpower to go to bed before 2:00 AM these days or wake up earlier than 2:00 PM)? Maybe I have not taken it for long enough?I just feel like I have totally lost the will to live. I do not want to die but I almost do not want to live either. My whole life I have been so depressed and the few times when I have felt genuinely happy just made me almost more depressed as I realized how rare it is for me to feel genuinely happy. The only things that really make me happy are my friends, my crush, Warhammer, and the occasional TV show. Everything else I ""enjoy"" is something that at best just makes me feel less awful. I do not have the energy for much of anything and I used to have other things i enjoyed they just do not bring me joy anymore.it is to the point that I am spending far more than is wise on Warhammer minis just because it is the only thing I have access to that does not make me want to kill myself. Modeling is one of the only things I get joy from, to build something with my hands as a creative pursuit to throw together stuff from different kits to make something my own with its own story I write. But I do not have the energy, patience, or willpower for painting anymore. So it all just ends up in various shades of grey.I have just been worn down by this depressing world to the point where I can hardly bear to be here anymore. So many people work SO hard and barely get a pittance. I am still passionate about my area of study (game design) but the job market is so competitive that I am unlikely to find work at all in that industry. I would consider a gap year or dropping out entirely but the friends I have made there are one of the only things that make me feel like staying, not to mention my crush there. I would consider changing major but that means more debt and I am less so much less passionate about other subjects. Every semester I say to myself ""this is the one, you will ask her out and try a relationship"" but there is always an obstacle. First it was fear of intimacy, then pandemic, fear of intimacy, and depression. I cannot conduct a relationship feeling like this, it is unfair to my partner, but the prospect of waiting or letting her leave my life seems nearly as bleak.TL;DR None of my dreams are attainable, the job market is too competitive, the world does not pay enough, and I cannot get my shit together for a relationship so the girl of my dreams is going to walk out of reach before I can do anything about it. I know when your back's against a wall all you are supposed to do is fight, but I am just tired. I am tired all the time. I do not want to die, but I do not want to live in a world that is so depressing, even apart from my own mental illness. Can I my brain not tell me to kill myself for five minutes?",1

"Does anyone elses mood fluctuate to the point where you cannot take it anymore? I have just been diagnosed with major depressive disorder but my mood will not stop changing all damn day long.

"Kids are some of the meanest, nastiest and cruelest bastards on the planet, and the more I think back all my problems came from that educational facility of torture. Most empressionable at a young age is true but it is also the easiest to get traumatized at and I was just food for the wolves in that hellish place. Had I not gone to that school and been spared with home schooling I would still likely have a functioning mouth, I would still probably be social awkward but I would not of been anywhere near as fucked up as I am now after having gone through our horrible education system. I would of been spared the bullying, spared the teasing, spared meeting horrible influences I would of been spared of nearly every single bad event in my life if I had just not been enrolled in school and I deeply regret setting foot in any of those buildings Elementary school is probably the worst thing we could of made",0
"I am constantly being insulted by my family for being lazy and what not and I completely understand why.But I really do hate it so much. I say anything back and they think I am disrespecting. They think giving advice like ""you are a little brat and you will not succeed in life ever and you are going to work in a horrible job or be homeless"" is good advice.I really should not be complaining considering my life is just so much better than most people I have read in this sub-reddit. it is just that I have felt like this for constantly and I feel like nobody wants to help.I am quite stupid and very stubborn. Probably inherited it from my parents as they are both stubborn. They constantly say things like ""You do not love me"" and that ""I am going to die one day"" and it really fucking hurts when they say that.I wish I could talk to my parents about suicidal thoughts properly. They are very dismissive that I have any mental health problems so I do not think they will care. I do remember vaguely as a child my mother said ""I wish I never had you"" or something along the lines. I would not of remembered it if it did not happen.I do not want to really talk to them either as one has been previously suicidal and has anxiety. I do not want to worry them any further as they always complain about it. I do not know if I can call myself their son if I constantly act like a piece of shit.Another thing I really hate is that I am forced to work. My parents say ""I am not forcing you to work"" but if I do not work, my brother and my family will threaten to take everything away from me (usually my phone) which is a huge detriment to me as I only really have friends online. During my summer holiday, which is now, instead of taking a break I am forced to work from 5pm till about 11:45pm.It does not help I do not sleep until times such as 7-10am as I want to have some time for myself without having to have a worry at the back of my head.I feel targeted, useless and a detriment to my family. I am called selfish and useless often and since I am the youngest, my problems are disregarded and called small.My childhood I was constantly compared to girls and other people and how much better they are than me and how they wished they had a girl instead. I hated it, I told them I hated it, they do not really care and say they are not comparing.it is amazing how I am being insulted at this very moment and currently being told to have my feelings suppressed and I am acting childish and I should just suck it up. it is amazing how much they do not care about me and they do not listen to a word I say. Sometimes I wish I was not so lazy and just ended myself. Enough of my sulking and running to my bedroom to cry, back to whining.I just wish I could seek help without being judged, without having that negative stigma, without hurting any feelings. I really cannot take this anymore.I often have suicidal thoughts but in the end of the day I am so useless I cannot force myself to get up, and just jump and snap my neck. Not like I am going to do anything about it, I am just a whiny attention seekerI suppose what really hurts my mental health is that a lot of my friends rely on me to help with their mental health issues, I have been helping for like 2.5 years and I really cannot handle it anymore. It hurts to see my friends like this, and it hurts that I cannot do anything anymore. they have had therapy but it does not work, so many of them rely on me. But nobody has the patience to help me since I am very very stubborn.I wish I can change, but I give up so easily. Working out? Give up in about 2 weeks. Drawing? See others do better and think ""people are better, there is no need for me"".I am such a stupid problematic piece of shit it is comical. I envy a lot of people that succeed because I am an asshole quite frankly. Seeing people achieve happiness and change, something I cannot do.I do not know if I can change at all. This mindset has been carved and refined through 16 years of my life.I suppose I am writing this for validation.

"Hello! I am a 21-year-old male. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder last November. I thought I was getting better because of meds and monthly visits to a therapist. But lately, it is really difficult for me to put effort and patience into the things I like, that is why I feel that I am not achieving anything in my life.Currently, I have no motivation to get out of my bed and try new things. I really want to start filmmaking, but I am so impatient to learn. I also want to exercise, but it is too hard for me to begin.I feel like I am not growing. I am stuck at rock bottom. To be honest, I am so pressured to be good at something always because I feel like I am running behind. I cannot stop comparing myself to others because some of my peers are already successful.Most of the time, I feel so dumb too. it is difficult for me to learn and remember things. I am also having a hard time building an opinion. I feel like I do not have enough skills to have a successful career. there is A Lot Wrong with Me that is Hard to Change",0

"I just tried to shoot myself about 30 days ago. Ended up going to inpatient and I thought things were getting better. When I got out though everything was just as bad as before. A lot of people I thought were good friends disappeared when I told them I was raped, abused, and tried to kill myself. I just do not think people really care about men when it comes to these things. My perpetrator said she wanted to make things right, but disappeared on my first day I got back out in the real world. At this point I feel I just need to get a 12 gauge and actually follow through. I have tried to kill myself so many times. My life is living hell, I have constant nightmares now about being raped, and I feel like I am always panicked. I just want this suffering to end. Nothing worked and I just need to blow my brains out. Nothing worked and its about time I actually do it.",1

"Finally after around 3 and a half years, I made myself get a job. I started down a habit of isolating myself from people, which lead to not taking care of myself, and that turned into weird looks from strangers that fueled the anxiety even more. Eventually I had hid away completely and sat in the depression, looking up ways to fix myself for sometimes entire days. Now that its been 3ish years fermenting like that I am pretty messed up. I have horrible resting bitch face. I do not reach out to people, been told its NPC energy... but when I do talk to someone, my smile is cringely forced and my voice is definitely forced.I work in a grocery store and I get a lot of looks and customers acting scared or worried ect. Does anyone have any tips for becoming less stressed out and serious about everything? Or at least acting more acceptable like that? How do I stop acting so extremely serious and depressed?",0
"I guess this is less about suicide and more about using self harm to hold myself from committing suicide, but suicide is on my mind too because it seems like that is the only way I could honestly get out of this situation. Basically I work in retail but we are almost always short staffed so they have come to depend on me for certain things. However this had taken a toll on my mental health (I was already prone to depression and suicidal thoughts, but I thought I learned to manage them before taking this job). Back in December, I began cutting, something I had never done before that point. I was able to stop myself in February and told myself I would work for 6 more months and then quit for the sake of my sanity. However in June, the store lost 3 workers who were considered very reliable and in this week, we lost 3 more. it is a dog job so I do not blame them, but because they are leaving, the management puts more on me. In these last few shifts, I have felt like I am on the verge of a breakdown. I am not even being paid $10 an hour. I am always sore and stiff from standing bent over for 9+ hours (processing product in a stockroom). And customer service is self explanatory. it is draining and lately I have been feeling like the only way I keep going without killing myself is to cut myself. My family agrees that I should quit and move on. However it is hard for me to approach any of management about it because I know they will try to negotiate with me (I am one of TWO associates who have been there for more than a year; the rest are all new with the oldest being two months) or try to guilt trip me, which could make the final two weeks awkward. And I do not think it is smart to say 'This job is making me self harm/suicidal'. I just do not know how to power through this situation without physically hurting myself. feeling trapped at job",1
"I have severe anxiety and OCD, and today I let them get the best of me. I looked through his phone. A huge breach of trust. I hate myself. I hate that I did it. I hate my mind. A lot of me thinks it would be better if I just killed my self so I will not make my emotional problems and baggage other peoples problems.

"I have been abused most of my life. Sexual abuse from a young age, emotional abuse as well. Mental abuse, though less frequent, and also, lately financial abuse. I am 33. I have never stopped living for my parents. I have had few friends, and none that lasted. I have had no relationships. I am isolated and afraid. I do not think I am going to last much longer like this, without falling apart. I have been depressed since I learned what sexual abuse was. it is isolating, to hear someone prattle on about something you know from experience, and warn against it like you have a choice about whether to be abused. To look around the room, and see frightened, amused, or curious faces, but not see anyone else looking around. No one else that might be wondering if they are the only ones that already experienced this. I do not want to get into my bad behaviors, just know they are destructive and ruining my life. And escalating. I feel like there is a part of me that is trying to break free, and it is dangerous. it is caused very dangerous situations in my life. it is all been so much worse, since last year. My mom died, and despite everything, I still loved her. I was the only one present when she died. I saw her face, and watched life leave her eyes. I am haunted to this day by that picture. Is there anything I can do? I am so scared and alone. I try to talk to people, and it always ends horribly. Nobody can understand me, or if they do, all they have is pity. I bring everyone down. I just want to be ok again. I miss having dreams for the future. Right now, my only dream is that there is an end to the suffering. Spiraling depression and bad behavior. cannot seem to muster the will to end it. I am feeling kind of lost and broken. Could really use some support",0
"I almost took my life not even 24 hours ago and no person in my life will know. I internalize my pain so much that I cannot do otherwise. I wrote my suicide note and it said ""Life is beautiful PEACE LOVE AND FREEDOM"" because to me that is just what matters in the end of the day and in the end of my life. I am only 20 and I am on my 5th suicide attempt. I have diagnosed CPTSD, clinical depression with psychotic tendencies, BPD and bipolar disorder and maybe I am schizoaffective but my doctor is trying to find a way to tell me about it in a way that will not make me panic or be sadder. I can tell in the way he asks me questions and the way he talks to my mother, that he tries to find a way to let her know too without making her panic or be sad. I know I need to get hospitalized but I cannot. I will not tell anybody about why I believe so but I say so because I am in the verge of an actual serious mental breakdown, not the one that people make memes about. I am close to going to my job, and throw all of the high end luxury desserts that take hours to make on the floor and start screaming my lungs out of fucking nowhere and just run outside and start running, I do not think I will because harm upon anyone but if I can even slightly feel that maybe I will then I absolutely WILL go to the hospital. I just want to be put on sedatives, and sleep all day. I want to feel like I am dead. I want to feel as if I do not exist anymore. I want the feeling of no one remembering me or thinking about me. I just want to be no one, I want to cease to exist. I want to cease feeling and hurting and mania and psychosis and crying loudly and panic attacks and anger and rage and sorrow and desperation I do not want to feel all those shitty feelings anymore. I do not want my memories anymore. I have CPTSD because I was raped three different times by different people. I have flashbacks sometimes, not as frequently as I used to. But when I do I scream and cry and hit myself and I just cannot be reasoned with and calmed down without sedatives. I cannot have sex with my boyfriend. Everything reminds me of it. The third time it was very violent. I got beaten and bled out of my ear. And that is why I hate bathrooms with green tiles. My doc says we can try EMDR and we sure can. He says we can try the electricity therapy which the name of I do not know in English. We can try ketamine therapy, and SSRI antidepressants and all those other new methods. Although I am done for. I do not think I can be saved. Keeping me from taking my own life is selfish at this point. I ache so badly I feel so fragile that I think if I walk out, the wind will take me away and I will scatter, like dust and sand. My body is so frail, I slowly become weaker and weaker each day physically and feel like I need help with basic self care. I cannot eat food. I do not want it. I just cannot even swallow it. My body does not allow me to give energy to myself. Yet I wake up every day at 5 am after working for 17 hours the previous day to get shouted at and belittled. And I work for all these hours with no breaks and no complaining. Today I cried in front of everyone. I have a sort of intimidating appearance, I have tattoos and my haircut is extreme and these people must have thought I am some badass but I am not. I cried today after attempting to take my own life a few hours before. They will never ever know. No one will. Soon, I will die in my own terms. Because this life, I just cannot take it in MY hands and do something. I am unable to because I am a weak little fucker. Thank you for reading. I hope your day is lovely. Idk",1
"I have been close to my friend for four years, in the friendship I was constantly apologizing for the mistakes that were not my own. We got in a lot of fights, mostly about respecting each other, since he never respected me. I made mistakes in the friendships, he made some overly bad mistakes. I was so scared of losing my friendship it ended up hurting me in the end. Throughout the friendship, I helped him so much, paid for so much, bought him things to make him happy, and helped him with a girl that he loved for so long, just so he could be happy. So many things, because a part of me thought he was going to be my best friend for life, and I was manipulated a lot throughout the friendship. Fast forward near our graduation, he gave me covid-19, and throughout covid 19, my dad passed away when I got symptoms, and I had to be locked in a small room throughout, and I never got to see my dad in his last moments/ when he passed. I stood in a room shaking, and that same idea torment's my soul, and has just weighed a huge amount of anxiety towards me. When I had covid, he would not let me tell any of our friends, he kept saying how it will ruin the friendship between me and him, and others. I was threatened, and vulnerable during the situation as my dad was currently in the hospital in critical condition. The only thing keeping me sane throughout the process that we were still friends, and he knew the most about my dad and I could talk to him. Throughout this incident, a month later he ended up cutting me off for reason's that I regret, but summary was he talked shit about me to make people hate me, and basically it was a situation between how these people hated eachother, and forced it upon me and him, and basically the two girls manipulated him the entire time to hate the two girls. At the end it switched up on me for the wrong reasons, lies were being told. In the end my friend basically got mad for bringing up his name and he told me to go kill myself, and told me I deserve everything that is happening to me. Now it continues that I am losing my other friends, I have fallen into depression, and he is slowly making everyone hate me. The only thing keeping me sane was being able to talk to people and distract myself, but nothing has gone good. Every single week something worse happens, and I just do not want to be on this planet anymore. I do not want to go throughout life, my life is over, my dad is gone, and everything is just garbage. It comes to the point where I cannot even explain this situation because it is so long, and it is so fucked up. I just wan't to be happy again, but i will truly never find happiness. I do not know how to cope, I cannot even talk to my family about it. I just hate my life. I hate my life, and it seems like it is getting worse.",1
"I am quite young and already in a deplorable state of health, and that is completely intentional Every single night I get wasted and smoke about 15 cigarettes, I have not played any sport in like 5 years. I am literally sitting all day on my gaming chair and when its 9pm I go out to get wasted with someshitty friends, go back home at 2pm, fall asleep miserably as I struggle to breathe properly, wake up, want to die, repeat.I have lost my parents trust countless times,I am completely immature and careless. It got to the point where my mom genuinely does not like me anymore, she is just so cold and insensitive every time I try to open up to her because of all the shit I made her endure when I was wasted : Tantrums, insults, damaged furniture, cops taking me homeThe worst part is that I am not even having fun when wasted, its a constant battle against my shitty urges, like the compulsive need to lie about everything, the compulsive need to tell my friends that they are the worst. I always end up having to apologize on something terribly cringe/inappropriate/nasty I said the day before, and I am drowning in shame every time I wake up because I know I said something awful or fucking bad. I cannot help it, alcohol always makes me say shit that Ill regret later. Last night something happened, I lied about something I should not lie about, my friends got crazy mad, It was a complete shit storm where everyone realized what a compulsive liar I was. In the middle of that I felt like I wanted to end it all and jump on the road to be ran over I hate every single aspect of my personality, I hate everything, why the fuck am I like this, I am nowhere near a good person, I have done nothing good in my life, I have learnt nothing, I have accomplished nothing, I have got friends who can debate on post-structuralism for hours and I cannot even open a book without getting bored out of my mind in seconds. I have got friends who enjoy their time, have fun, laugh together and I always feel the need to ruin everything with lies and maliciousness I feel like I cannot go on",1

"I always shit the bed when I have to make major changes in life, so I put them on hold indefinitely and then feel guilt and self loathing. I also have anxiety. While my depression is manageable and I am functional (I do not feel a thing most days, I do not feel sad or happy, or anything at all), is this related to depression? I am planning to seek therapy once Corona dies down a little here. Is indecisiveness in anyway related to depression?",0
I have set my deadline. It feels like such a relief to know Ill be gone by then. The thought of it makes me happy. I will finally be free from this hell I have been living in.I have had a really bad week. My only friend (who I have romantic feelings towards but am too much of a scared loser to tell her) has been ignoring me and I feel I have hit a new low. She is the only person that makes me happy and the every time I spend time with her I actually feel happy to be alive. But then as she leaves its right back to reality. I have been cutting so much recently and its draining all of my energy. I cannot focus on anything I used to enjoy and am struggling to get any work done. I have a few family events I am going to that will be a final goodbye of sorts and then it will be time. I cannot wait. The years of self harm and suicidal thoughts will finally climax and end how they should. I have never told anyone about any of this so thanks for reading &lt;3 My plans are made,1
"It was the only thing that *internally* made my symptoms better. I finally had energy to get up and go, to get tasks done. It made my already short fuse microscopic. I took it for 2 years with a couple of breaks, and only after being off of it for 7 months, I realize I was basically in a hypomanic state the whole time I took it. I was not myself, but at least I could actually get out of bed in the morning. Zoloft made me manic as well. I am afraid to take anything but I desperately need it. My therapist does not think I am bipolar since my mania has been exclusively triggered by meds.. so I feel completely helpless. My depression is currently eating me alive but I have every intention of helping myself, I just do not know what to do. Can anyone relate? Wellbutrin (Bupropion) turned me into a monster",0
"I feel like I remember almost everything that has happened in the 14 years of my life, even super small things. And looking back on everything just makes me realise how miserable my life really was, I have realised how shitty my family was and also all things I have missed out on in life that all my (ex) friends got to experience. Looking back on everything makes me feel so weird and life feels so alien to me now. Its like a feeling of nostalgia but in such a depressing, ugly, gross form. Its also making me feel conflicted, as if I do not know who I am or have been, nor what I want. I cannot even tell if I want to be happy or not. It also feels like my life is flashing before my eyes and that my life is coming to an end soon. At the same time I have been having anxiety of the world ending and being apart from the person I love, but I am not sure if the two are connected. Either way I am thinking so much about life and death right nowI've tried looking for answers but I have not gotten any. I do not understand any of this, I am 14 and I have been depressed since I was 10 but I have never experienced something this low before. I cannot tell if its an existential crisis or not but it is so fucking depressing my lord. For some reason this only happens during the day but at night I feel kind of okay about it. idk I have been feeling so reflective on my life recently",0
"I know humans are not meant to be perfect, but there is got to be a minimum standard, and I fall way below it.Depression kicked my ass when I was 9. I still cannot find enough motivation to brush my teeth daily. I have so much plaque and tooth ache and I keep telling myself maybe if I brush a little more it will all go away but I know that is not possible without a trip to the dentist. But I am going to be judged, not just by the dentist, by my family when they know the state of my teeth. I will have to pay for it out of pocket too and I really cannot afford that right now.I am overweight. Severely, I think. I hate waking up and remembering I am in this 75kg+++ body and even taking a shower makes my heart race because I am so fat and I spend hours every day pinching, poking, prodding. This is what people see when they talk to me. Disgusting. And yet I do not do anything about it. I tell myself ""oh, body positivity, eat whatever I want since life is short and I will die anyways"" and then end up binging tens of thousands of calories.I have a high degree. I think my eyes are in the 900s. At this rate I would rather gouge them out and go blind. My screen time amounts to 14 hours and more every day and I know I should be improving my life but it takes too much effort.This world. I do not want to live in a world where we are all just working for the sake of being able to afford to live. Work a few hours. Buy a few things. Repeat. Rinse. Why am I even studying? So i can get a higher paying job. For a better future. I do not want to live anymore. I want to be a plant somewhere in the world with nothing to care about. I want to improve my life but god damn am I chronically lazy. I see no end to this. I do not know how to continue living in this stupid house sharing a room with a sister I have not talked to in almost a year. In this stupid house, waking up to being screamed at by my parents, hearing them body shame me all the time and agreeing because what they are saying is true, everything is just too much and I just want to have a room of my own to cry inThey keep pressuring me to become the money maker in the house. I got a part time job along side my full time studies, but I got fired because I would always prioritize my school projects (filming and things) over work. I have not told them. I cannot even sell pictures of myself like I used to because I gained almost 10kg since then and nobody wants to look at a disgusting fat body with scars all over it, do they?I am only 17. I do not know where my life's headed. Never had my birthday celebrated since my sister was born, because I am born in December and she is born in January so the entire month of Dec is spent planning for her birthday. They do not even remember when I am born anymore. I feel like a ghost, a punching bag, a sorry pathetic excuse.I just feel overwhelmed right now and needed to let it off my shoulders. I say all this but I am probably never going to do anything about my life since I am just lazy. And tired. Mostly fat and lazy. I destroyed my own life",1

"I was having such a shit day and was mentally exhausted even though I did not really do anything other than think. I found some peaches that were going mouldy so I told myself I would make a pie to use them up. I love cooking but I have never made a pie before, but let me tell you, it was... the most... motherfucking delicious thing I have ever tasted. If my dad was not next to me, I would have cried, honestly. I spent so much of my day criticising myself and feeling so worthless and angry and terrified and bitter and hopeless about my life. But then I made a nice pie. And as weird as it may seem, it made me so happy because I did not feel like a failure for a while. And it was a fucking great pie! And I am proud of myself!

Its helped my anxiety but I am not necessarily happy, just numb. Is this as good as it gets?

"Hi, so I have this friend, me and her are extremely close. She also suffers with depression and I have been there and dropped everything when she has those depressive episodes and I have always supported her and tried to help her the best I could. Last night I crashed and had one of these episodes where I felt really low and suicidal, I ended up ignoring everyone and just sat there by myself, she messaged me a few times asking me if I was okay and I did not respond until today because I just felt so low and I just could not. I told her I crashed and that I am fine and she did not seem too fussed or bothered by it but then I am just texting her normally as I would and she asks me if I have got a problem because I must of been texting unenthusiasticly because of what happened and now she is ignoring me on purpose and talking to someone else, it just makes me feel like shit because I am always supportive and always caring about her but then she is just ignoring me and she has not offered to call me or asked me if I want to do anything she just asked me if I was okay and I feel like that is just the bare minimum, I feel like shit and this has just made me feel so much worse and I do not know what to do, what do I say to her to let her know I feel like this without coming across as an assholeThanks in advance Am I an asshole expecting help?",0

I am always mad all day everyday and still want to kill myself. I hate my family and I am starting to hate my friends. I hate myself because I am still alive when I should have died years ago. All my familys problems stem from me.My mom finally divorced my stupid ass dad but is still dealing with all the bullshit that comes with it. He would not have even left if I had not punched him. He treated me like a dog and never called me by my name but instead of punching him I should have just offed myself right then and there.Best case he would blame himself and come with me to hell where I can beat his ass forever. Worst case all the problems still happen but I do not have to hear about it.I do not know I guess I am just another teen with issues that stem from his father. How original... I am not even sad anymore,1
"I have been homeless a few months short of a year. Positivity on my mind to push through. I paid for a reservation at a motel (Hometowne studios by the red roof Norcross GA AVOID) They forced cancelled my reservation, I called Obitz.com to get my money back they said 10 days. Tried to call my back (Wal-Mart money card) same thing. Now I am locked out of my account and cannot get another card. My weekend ever.

This is okay, because its too much of a struggle to get people to understand your pain. Its okay.Thank you all. Running out of gas",1
"24MI do not know what to do. Nothing makes me happy any more, in the last year I have alienated all of my friends from the past 8-20 years with the exception of one who I saw today and even then I felt like the spark was not there any more. All the others (15+ people) all decided to excommunicate me simultaneously and I still do not fully understand why. Its been the most traumatic time having all the people I have held closest to my heart all turn their backs on me at once and its left me with feelings of hatred towards myself and feelings of total emptiness and unbearable lonelinessI feel unlovable and unlikeable, when I look in the mirror I hate what I see, looks aside, I loathe the person I have become over the past years, I find it hard to make friends now because if I were anyone else, I know I would not want to be my friend. I am awkward, shy, ugly and have nothing to offer in any situation. I feel like every interaction is forced and that even when I try my hardest its still painfully obvious that I am an insecure wretch. I am unemployed, uneducated and no longer have anyone to talk to besides my councillor once a week. Not sure if that is really doing much for me either. I no longer enjoy anything that used to interest me, I have even given up on music at this point. All I want is some companionship but feel like Ill never be able to attain it because I have become so fucking numbed out and boring that no one ever wants to befriend me. I do not know what I want to do with my life and feel like I have no real guidance so I am destined to work soul destroying jobs that I hate that make me miserable.I just feel so alone and that I am unable to do anything about it because my feelings of not being good enough because me to constantly push other people away for fear they might see me the same way I see myself. I do not even want to try any more, every time I have something good I still manage to fuck it up beyond repair and end up back at square one. Life just does not feel like its worth all of this pain and loneliness. I do not understand how it can ever get better Feeling like I am at the end of my rope",0
"Since my depressed period started some time ago, I have a specifc ""place"" my minds always thinks about when I am feeling bad (or feeling just nothing, depressed in general). it is just a bus stop near my house, and I do not know why my mind just keeps going back to this place, it correlates this place with feeling depressed (but I do not even go there that much, do not have any trauma there or anything like that).Now I cannot get through there, when I do, I just feel extremely bad, the depression only hits harder for some reason. Am I the only one who has this kind of weird thing? Am I the only one who has this kind of ""thought""?",0

"I have become so detached from the world that it feels meaningless, we spend our whole life building somthing for ourself , finding out who we are and for what? Just to die and lose it all, it seems so pointless to live if we die anyway. I have a loving family , friends for the first time in my life and even went on a few dates for the first time in my life yet all I can think about is how we are all going to die. It cripples me. what is the point",0
"I do not really know how to explain this but I kind of just want to die since months now but I am scared of it. Why? Well, I am scared of dying in pain or even surviving it and living with a disability. I also am kind of feel bad because of my best friend who takes care of me for more than a year now and once told me that he will kill himself also when he dies. He feels guilty for my behavior and also thinks that he cannot live with the conscience not saving me. Does anybody feels like me? Or am I the only one? Does anybody knows what I should do? I want to die but I am scared of killing myself",1
"I do not know why but it hurt so much. Just the feeling that someone that I once considered my best friend and someone that I had so many memories with just did not care.I knew that he would agree with me but it really hurt me that I poured my heart out saying how fun it has been and he just replies with a single sentence.I do not know man I just feel so sad about it for no reason and really needed somewhere to vent. I just told my friend of 5 years that we are not as close anymore and I wrote an entire paragraph to end things on good terms and all I got was ""okay, have a good life""",0

"I do not know if this is the best place to post this, but I needed to write my thoughts down. My father told me today that hes arranged to go for a week holiday in September with his friends. I have not had the chance to be alone for longer than 24 hours for awhile now so I felt in my heart like this would be the perfect time.I have been wanting to end my life for awhile now. I attempted to take my life about 2 years ago, I was so broken but in the end I was stupid enough to think there was a glimmer of hope and I did not go through with it all the way. Since then I have received help and support from my family and a few friends which I am so grateful for but in the end nothing has changed. I am such a burden and waste of space on everyone and I am still the empty she will of a person I have always have been. I have not got any better, only worse. So the thought of ending my life brings me comfort, knowing Ill have peace at last and the pain will stop. So I have waited it out, just drifting through limbo until the opportunity came.I have always been subconsciously planning to get things organised after my first attempt. In some sense I have been slowly making sure all of my accounts and belongings are in order so it will be a little easier for my family in some way. But now I have two months to really plan and organise it, but I have do it in such a way that my family will not notice anything off.I like to be organised, even with death I guess. So as well as how I am going to end my life. properly this time, I just need look in to things like: -my student dept and what happens when I do pass away, will the debt so straight to my parents? I want to pay so much off now as I can so if that happens its not as much for them. -Make sure to leave them letters and also leave my usernames and passwords to my bank, phone account etc.-Which would be the best day to do it, towards the end of my fathers holiday? so if that my mum calls on the day and I do not answer, she would ring my father in a panic and he would have to to leave his holiday earlier to come back to open the house to check on me. I cannot think of anything else while typing this right now but Ill make posts on here as I go. I am writing this and posting it on here in hopes that my family or friends might find peace if they ever come across my Reddit account. I hope they will know that I loved them with all my heart but this is truly what I wanted. Or Ill probably just delete my account towards the end. but I just I feel better writing it all down. My two month plan",0
"Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone else gets more depressed the day after drinking. My depression was getting better until yesterday that I was hanging out with some friends and had two beers(I am not much into alcohol so when I drink I do not go over 2 beers) and today I woke up feeling like shit, I did not get out of bed, I just had a shower and that is about it.

"I have been struggling to enjoy anything for the last couple of months. I feel at my lowest lately, I lost all my confidence and i just want the days to pass as quickly as possible. I just want to sleep all day or pause life for a year. All of this is happening with me because of a toxic relationship. We ""ended"" things like a month ago, but it should have been more like a little break where we would work on ourselves. The problem is that we still hang out a lot, but I am the only one fixing the problems, trying to do better and changing things. She says that she has put enough effort in the relationship before and now it is only my turn to do that (I was not the only one being toxic,she was too; she thinks i was more toxic than her) I am trying everyday to fix things,but she disrespects me a lot, she plays me and puts me through a lot of shit that literally destroys my mental. I just cannot leave. I know it sounds easy,but i cannot do it. it is impossible. I do not have the strenght to do it,because i lost all my self esteem and i just feel stuck here, hanging on to the tiniest string that i can save the relationship. I feel so deppresed and unhappy and i do not want to live life anymore. I am not suicidal. I just wish i could fast forward my life. I cannot enjoy anything anymore",0

"I need advice; worried about my boyfriend I am not a doctor, but I am a nurse. I have been dating my boyfriend for over 1.5 years and living with him for about a year. Generally speaking he is a very anxious/paranoid person. He also has days where he cannot get out of bed and feels down. He also has serious social anxiety and does not trust most people. I have wanted him to see a doctor about this for a long time, but he was afraid of taking medications and did not want it to change who he is. That being said- He was recently in a bad car accident. The people that T boned him died and he is really torn up about it. His friend that was in the car with him is also now money hungry and states that he is going to come after my boyfriend financially somehow even though the accident was 100% not his fault based on what happened and the police report. His car is totaled, the police took it to a tow lot which has racked up to about $1000, there is attorneys involved, and its just a big stressful mess. This has REALLY set off his anxiety and depression. Hes paranoid that investigators are watching him, he feels hopeless, hes super anxious, he cannot get out of bed some days, he has obsessive thoughts about WHY his friend would do what hes doing, WHY the people pulled out and t-boned him etc. I am worried the depression will progress and become even more serious. He finally talked to a doctor about it and the doctor prescribed Cymbalta. After doing some reading online, I am scared for him to start it. It sounds like it has some harsh side effects, harsh withdrawals if he comes off of it, hard on the liver (we like to cocktail), and does not seem like a good starter med. I really want him to be on something, but I am worried this is not the best med choice. We attempted to call the doctor to discuss, suggested lexapro or Zoloft, but the receptionist told us that the doctor does not like to be told what to prescribe. It was uncomfortable. Any professional advice would be great. My boyfriend, a car accident, Cymbalta",0

Everyone I loved has left. I have some family but I am just a burden to them I know it. If they were not good they would leave too. They must feel obligated. I wish I could go back. Back to when I was not pregnant. I should have ended it then. I do not deserve to live. I do not deserve him. I am scared of losing him. I probably make no sense. Maybe this is just a weak moment.

Just a few patches to help heal and cover the cuts that will most def leave a few scars and it is fixed.Why is dying so hard? we are so physically fragile if you think about it but when you try to end your own life it is near impossible. Though, I feel like I tried one of the more challenging methods this time around.Sigh. I just want to leave. I tried yesterday",1
So for the past 3 years I have been selfharm free I have never had the urge to cut or anything not even do anything dangerous to myself. But recently 4 months ago i developed depersonalization disorder it is horrible since then I have started selfharming again just because nothing feels real i have no friends and just no one cares about me anymore. Ever since i turned 17 everyone has just left me to be an adult pretty much now i just do not feel ready. I have not even had a hug in 5 years let alone hang out with someone. If I am being quite honest here. I am thinking about taking my own life.My mental health has decreased massively especially with all the restrictions and constant reminders to wear masks and keep safe is just driving me insane. I am sorry Started Cutting Again,1

I am getting the cold shoulder from coworkers and I do not know why.

I am tired of the depression, anxiety, feeling like I am nothing but a fuck up.I am 42 and what the fuck do I have going for me? I might lose my job I have built my career on due to things i cannot even defend bc I was not allowed to. Everything I have worked hard for. I do not want to be here anymore and I have lost the will to live. I have no friends here and my family is 1000 miles away. ODing is not going to do shit, I do not have a gun, I do not even have helium and an exit bag like I planned. I hate cutting but its my only other option at this point. I do not even know why I am typing this out. Bc subconsciously I want to fight but I have lost the fight in me, if that makes sense. Psychiatrist told me to call 911 if you are suicidal no. Why?

I have put myself out there and I can get girls to like me just never that way. Which I settled, thinking eventually that will change. I will find my perfect match and I wanted to respect everyone has their choices even if it meant friendzoning me. well 15 years later of nos and I am losing hope and with every rejection I become a little less confident.My social skills are not much so I have slowly crawled further and further in a reclusive state.When I was 18 I had no idea what I was going to do with my life, nor was I motivated to make the most of it, but my friend convinced me into enlisting in the military. As they had a lot of benefits and opportunities.I thought hey, this will jump start my life and can motivate me to be the best person I can be. So I joined the Navy, but between the massive amount of crappy leadership, everything becoming more unfair, the shitty hours in the hot sun, I felt the military did a lot to demotivate me.

Nor do I even know how to meet people at this age and my introverted nature certainly does not help. I have made an improvement that I have spent this year dieting and exercising, so I am making at least some improvement in my life and I have taken some pride in that.

"I do not even know why I am writing this tbh. I just see myself dead soon. I do not want to have to work for the rest of my life and live with mental illness. My brain is so messed up lol. Depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, eating disorder; I definitely have a personality disorder too lol. It consumes my thinking. Growing up gay in a homophobic city really has not helped either. I find it hard to trust people around guys my own age. I abused weed hardcore for one and a half years, I finally quit about 2 weeks ago and I feel stupid as hell for doing it everyday for so long. I fucked up my brain to escape reality. I do not feel pleasure in doing things normal people do, everything I do is just to numb myself and escape reality. I feel I have no personality other than being depressed. I am relatively smart and know that I can get a decent paying job in the sciences, but at this point I wonder if i even want it. I have been suicidal for the past 5 years, the only thing that kept me going was the hope for a better future. Well, time has passed, and while my life is better than it was in high school, I still feel this mental illness rotting my brain. I do not feel joy when I am around people. All I feel is anxiety, shame, and fear. The only time I feel good is when I am on drugs. At this point, I just do not know if I want to put in the effort to keep living, when I am just keep feeling numb either way. Why bother trying when I could just die and be the end of it? I know that my death would make my mom and two best friends sad, but I just do not know if I want to keep living anymore. Depressed rant",1
"I am curious if anyone here has experienced a ""fall from grace"" (apologies if this is not the most correct term) specifically you became the best (or highly skilled) at something in your life, but due to whatever circumstance, you are now no longer able to do that thing.A couple examples as it relates to me would be Michael Phelps or Dominique Dawes, olympic athletes who competed at an extremely high level, and basically devoted their entire lives to becoming the best at their chosen thing (or happened to become the best through their drive/passionate). Both of them are no longer able to compete at those levels anymore, and have stated in interviews that they suffer(ed) from deep depression for a multitude of reasons. What I gather one of the largest reasons is, is that they wrapped their entire identities around what they did, yet now that they lead more of a normal (possibly even mundane) life, there is a lost sense of self, and potentially nothing else could ever compare to their accomplishments / life long love / pursuits. I am asking this, as I have lived this life (non-olympic), and have felt the same way as the both of them for many years. The problem is that I have not met anyone else personally who is experienced this (which is why I am asking), and it is just as isolating as the quote ""it is lonely at the top"". What I specifically struggle with now (for many years), is once you have experienced a joy, fulfillment, and/or accomplishment on such a high level, the pursuit of any other endeavor seems almost meaningless. Of course one could hope to strike lightning twice, yet your ""first love"" (ie. the thing that you did), seems to always outweigh what anything else *could* be (at least for me). there is also a potential guilt I subconsciously feel about *truly* choosing to move on to something else. As a side note, I have done deep work with a Therapist regarding this, which has been beneficial to a degree. I appreciate anyone for taking the time to read this, and/or lending your own thoughts and experiences. Thank you. Fall from grace",0

"I was diagnosed when I was 16. Turning 31 in September and this last year has been the worst experience to go through. Lost the most beautiful amazing girlfriend, along with so-called ""friends"". I have been and going through mental torture even after being told to kill myself rather. I am thinking that after all these medications, treatments and rehab stins is all even worth it. Nothing really got better besides having to coast through life this past year all by myself with my moms help and motivation. I can deal with not having friends as honest truthful loyal people with hard to come by in todays modern age but losing my girl completely broke me. Sure i can blame it on the pandemic but I should gave known better then to hope it would pass by quick. It kept me from my girl who is also a healthcare worker which made it even more difficult. Losing her broke me down mentally and physically to the point I ended up in hospital last year after a overdose. The worst was to come after leaving the hospital. I tried to mend relationships which were long gone for the lack of being a better person. I will always aim to be the better person as I am not in this game called life to break my fellow human down. As my psychiatrist said, I would rather hurt myself then to hurt the next person who have done me wrong because my moral value does not allow me to hurt anyone physically or mentally. But having it done onto me, depression kicks in and panic arises which I cannot control. Reason for me not being able to speak freely to anybody as I have no close ""friend or companion"" that I can trust. My heart is broken and my head is in shambles. I miss my Ex-GF dearly every single day as it was the only relationship that ever felt real to me. It was not young puppy love, it was real and I have no way of getting it back. The thought of not ever seeing her again haunts me every single day which is why I just want to give up. I would be selfish in saying life is tough but I would also be honest in saying it. I do not want to wonder around life anymore with the hopes of things getting better. I am way past that already. Everything is ruined. I do not have a dad, he passed when I was 12. I want to let go so that my mom can enjoy her golden years by being happy again and not have to worry about her everyday depressed son. I will not get the opportunity to make Pikachu smile again, the opportunity vanished and 10 July is a day I regret in my life. So much for this thing called life when you cannot be happy. 30 years old now, I do not want this for the next 30. Call me selfish all you want.

I could have the best fucking day of my life but I would still be sad at the end of it.I have only one friend but that friend is strugling with her own mental health so i do not want to but another burden on top of her. Oh, btw, that right there was also something a self-centered person would say, why should somebody care about me? it is very egoistic to think that i matter enough to make a diffrence to anybody.I also have diagnosed asperger syndrome and i fucking hate it. I CAN read peoples emotions (normally aspies cannot, according to google) but i do not know how to react and I am very-very uncomfortable in social situations (espesially with people of my own age (13-15) ).

"it is not that I never feel any excitement or emotions. I can get excited about a new game, tear up for a sad movie, laugh at a joke, and even smile when something good is happening. it is just, these feelings, these emotions, they come as suddenly as they disappear. Because these feelings fade away so quickly, I often find myself seeking out new material to stimulate my emotions, be it a good book, a new game, or a sad movie. But it really sucks, because even when I am doing this, I easily lose interest, and end up having to start something new way before I even come close to finishing what I just started. Yet despite this, I cannot stop, because if I do not do this, I feel like I am simply just breathing and not actually living. I am always overwhelmed by boredom and fatigue, but even more than that, I just feel so very empty all the time. Its as if there is a large gaping hole at the bottom of my heart, no matter how much I fill it up, everything just falls right out and once again, it is empty again.

"Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time.

I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time?

"I have wasted this life. I am in my early 20s and I feel like I have wasted my youth and oppurtunities, some people might laugh at that but its true. I have no real friends, no strong connections to anyone, and nothing to be proud of. I just disappoint everyone around me and myself. I am worthless and I am so ashamed to be alive. I do not feel like I deserve to be alive. that is not me shitting on myself, that is just me being realistic. I have let my life slip away. My whole life I have fantasized about living a different one, and it is left me with nothing. I think I am one of those people where suicide is just kind of an obvious choice. If so many other people can do it, why cannot I? I am just tired. I feel so bad because by killing myself I would devastate my family and I have already burdened them so much just by existing. I have failed them. I wish I could erase myself. I cannot prolong this anymore. The shame is too much and I want to put an end to this. I think it is coming soon done",1

"I am on lexapro, 15mgs, started taking it back in august or october of 2020 i think. Recently I have been just purposely not taking it because i feel like i do not deserve to get better, resulting in suicidal thoughts. I have always felt this way, I am scared to get better I am scared to live a normal life for it is foreign to me. idk self sabotage i guess Forcing myself to be depressed.",1
"You want someone to feel emotional pain?? Why?? I think that sounds wonderful if no one could cry at my funeral, I would not want to bring emotional pain like that to someone, especially if its someone I care about. I think that is the thing driving me from ever kicking the chair. I hate to offend but I think that is selfish to wish for someone to feel emotional grief like that, have you seen someone go through grief??? Its terrible. Its ugly and painful and I would not wish it on anyone. So why would you want someone to go through that? Sorry if I hurt someone by saying this, I do not intend this to be offensive, I am just astounded that people genuinely think this and I want to know why? I hate it when someone says no one is going to cry for me when I am gone",0
"I turned 19 a week ago and I am currently on summer break till next month when I go back to college, I have found that my depression gets really bad when I come home especially during summer break because its longer than other breaks. I feel so much better when I am on my own in my dorm its like I can finally breathe for a while, then I come home and after a week I am reminded why I cannot stand it there. My mother switches from saying she missed me to calling me the laziest person she knows, saying she wish she never had me, hitting me, throwing my things away without asking me then insulting me when I get upset, and so much more. My siblings and my dad do not really care and when I complain my older sister gaslights me and says, she is going through a lot and she works hard so what if she takes it out on you?. My mom and dad said they do not want me to go back to my dorm but its mandatory for sophomores anyway so I am going to end up going and I am going to save up to move out permanently, I cannot wait to go back to school, I neither crying or I am numb I hate it here and I feel so powerless.

"You always need to make life for yourself. You need to find yourself. You need to search 4 joy, get a profession etc. I know, you have the (sorta) freedom of choice here (I guess, Sartre was right in this regard as we are doomed to freedom). But, the thing is, smth are not always out there 4 you. I get into periods of time where I do not know wtf I should do with myself often. Almost every day. Interests fade away - then they come back. Then, I see some value in me - then it dissapears once again. I just want thing to come easy to me with a natural interest. I do not want to use my intellect for everything like all the time. Meh...

"Does anyone else ever feel not just like they do not want to be here anymore but like they do not want to have been created in the first place? Once you exist, wanting to not exist is its own terrifying issue. could not I just not have been born? I was not even conceived on purpose. I certainly did not make life easier for my parents. But this is one doodle the cannot be undid. So now I am just stuck having to find a solution to the pain and emptiness and existential panic. I DID NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THIS. I did not consent to this being alive thing.",1
"I really did think about suicide a lot as a kid and teen, failed (kind of sad) attempt as a teen, one attempt in 20s. My 29 birthday is coming up and I refuse to even celebrate it because I have accomised absolutely nothing in life. I can barely work dead end jobs unrelated to my degree that do not even add up to full time. Due to mental illness I put a huge burden on my sister. I have almost no ""real"" friends, the only reason I am actually still am alive is because I do not want to because my sister pain from either finding my body or me dying in a random field and her never finding I stopped actively planning. I guess that is progress for now. Does anyone actually deal with having passive SI most of the time? Suggestions? Before you ask yes I do have a therapist Passive suicidal ideation",1

"Around 2 years ago I was really sad and suicidal and never told anyone. I thought life was over for me, but then a girl entered my life and she became my whole world. I became happier then ever, i felt as joyous as i had been when i was a kid. We did everything together. I knew that my life had meaning when i was with her. We where controlling over each other and we both prioritized each other as number one. We got jealous of each other and there where bitter moments because we could not seem to do anything without one another. We made boundaries and i broke a boundary she felt very dearly about. She broke up with me and i felt my whole world fall apart. I am filled with guilt, loneliness, and bitter sweet nostalgia that i cannot seem to get over. I cannot think of a reason to be alive. I only ever wanted to be here when i was with her and now she is gone. I feel worse then before i met her and i cannot stand this feeling in my heart of desperate sadness and longing to be with someone who will never be either you again. I hate to sound this vulnerable. Idk what to do",1

I am sick of living. i was hoping I would get a fatal allergic reaction from the vaccine but i did not even get any side effect. here is to hoping the second dose can magically kill me. maybe a fatal car accident. maybe dying in my sleep. maybe getting stabbed. something fatal. anything and anyone that can kill me. i want death a tired person",1
"My sister got married recently, and as many of us with depression may do when we attend a wedding, I have been ruminating on my life and proximity to my (hopefully) future wedding and coming out more sour than sweet. And the biggest punch in the gut is not that I have not found the right partner, but rather that I do not have a group of friends to make the day special with. I was my sister's maid of honor, and she had such a beautiful group of bridesmaids to spend the week with leading up to her wedding, who have been her friends for quite some time. And she and her partner had so many wedding guests to invite (even with a Covid-safe ceremony) that made the day feel so special. I am happy for her, but I have to admit I am also jealous. My depression has turned me into a recluse, and I struggle to name people who are close enough friends to stand by me at the alter on my wedding day, and how many people do I really know who would be excited to attend my wedding as guests?I know that weddings do not have to be huge ceremonies to be special, but I struggle to think of even a small group of people who would happily show up for me. Unfortunately many people in my family are toxic, and I do not have close friends, so thinking about my future wedding guest list is so stressful. What if I end up with a partner who wants to invite lots of people, and I have almost no one to invite? How sad will that be? I feel so pathetic. The hardest part of a wedding",0
"I cannot imagine living like this anymore. My life has become just surviving day to day, its not even life anymore. My depression has got a bit better recently but only because its summer and after it ends, its going to be hell. Still do not know how, but I am reconsidering some options, i just need to find confidence to really do it (which I am most scared of obviously)I do not even have any goals or anything to looking forward to in life. I feel lost and alone, just like i lost some of my inner soul in past and now I am like trying to at least survive to another day expecting something will change it might get better or I would get better but it just will not. I cannot get over things that happened and i fucked up. I hate myself, my stupid brain and every single thing of myselfRemember that one time when you were young and someone asked you or you just imagine if you had milion dollars/infinte money, what would you do with it?Because now only think I would buy is gun and shoot myself.

i had a depressive episode that lasted all of 2020 and kind of stopped in may or april of this year now i can feel myself being depressed again. i cannot feel like that anymore. i just do not want to be like this anymore.i went to a psychiatrist in april. she helped with my anxiety but with less anxiety my depression got worse. i have less energy. i do not get panic attacks anymore but the panic attacks at least gave me a bit of relief afterwards now my anxiety just stays. and at least i had a little bit of anxious energy. now i just float in my misery and disassociate. i do not want to feel like this anymore. i do not want to feel like shit anymore. i want it to be over. i do not think anyone can help me. i feel like no one and nothing could. i do not think i will kill myself. i just want to hurt myself i think. just to feel something. i think there is something very wrong with me. i cannot feel like this anymore,1
"I have had depression since I was 12. I do not have motivation nor energy even for the things I like. I have a smothering relationship with my parents. I am almost 27 years old, with no reason to live, no relationships, and no money. I want to escape and live somewhere else. I will find a dead-end job and find an apartment. No one understands nor tries to understand what I am going through. For everyone else, the solutions are straightforward. Move out, see a therapist, take anti-depressants, get a job, meet new people, read books on self-help, learn to love me more, learn from my mistakes. I have done several of those things. Will doing all those things together heal me? I feel depression will never leave me. it is always been there, talking very loudly or softly at times. No one really tries to talk to me and understand. Everyone just judges me as an irresponsible, lazy, inmature, naive, silly, introverted, boring, square person. No one tries to understand and even if they did, no one can help me.The person in my life which I loved the most broke up with me. She did not love me. And she is better off without me. She confessed how she did not break up with me earlier because of how I would react and be afterward. She was right and I feel like shit and it is not just the breakup. I have tried meditation, no contact, therapy, books, hobbies, introspection, you name it. I am not worthy of love or understanding. I know she knew she did not like who I am. I cannot do anything about that. But no one has ever liked me. that is why I have no friends. that is why the unending cycle of rejections of everyone, including family members.What I hate the most is that I just want that person who broke up with me to reach out. But that will not do any good. Even if she really did love me, like me, and cared, it would not change anything. Am I better off dying? I ask myself this question every day. My presence in people's lives has only hurt it. I have nothing but prove. it is like having a terminal disease. I just destroy everyone around me as I slowly die because I have no convictions, will, desires and goals. But I cannot choose to kill myself. I cannot stand the thought of dying. I want to live. I want to want to be better. But that is just it, I would like to have the desire to be better. Deep down I want peace, to be understood and love, but that does not cure depression. I have even taken medicine in the past. Nothing has helped. I am useless, worthless, just meaningless. I do not want to live anymore",0
"14 y/o. i do not want to do anything anymore. my passion for everything that i once liked, enjoyed or benefited me has gone out of the window. and i do not see the benefit in doing them any more. some days when i wake up from a 4 hour sleep, i wish id had just never woken up at all and that i would just fall asleep forever, and never wake up again. i always said that dreams were better than real life. and that has been the only statement i have ever made where i think i have been right. i hate talking to other people in fear that i will muck up. I am already quite introverted, but now every time some even does something as simple as greeting me, i want to get as far away from them as possible to prevent conversation where i will inevitably mess up. my daily schedule now consists of wake up, do school, go back upstairs and lay there until i have dinner. i have no will to get up and do something that even i know will be good for me. i want to just go away, and that is the drifting thought that frequents me in my brain. i believe that everyone hates me (which they probably do due to me being very unlikable) and they just keep me around for their own social advantage. i frequently want to just run away from every human and cry in a corner where i can just forget i even exist. i do not want to tell anyone, and i do not know if that is a good or a bad thing, since i probably just burden other people with my presence, and i will just annoy and make them hate me. but i want to know if its worth telling someone, or if I am just being a teenage hypochondriac. what should i do? sorry for ranting, i just needed to get this out of my head and online. i do not want to kill myself. i just want to disappear.",0

"They think they can ""snoop"" at me without me noticing. I notice it and they are wrong for thinking I do not notice it and for thinking negatively of me.

When I first started opening up, my father called me ""crazy"". Now, they think I am ""dumb"". Both are demeaning things to call someone, especially to their own child. it is a shame our parents do not have knowledge about mental health. My parents think I am unaware",1

People keep saying go to clubs n stuff but that will not happen overnight and right now I am constantly thinking how much of a loser I am and how I should not exist and I do not know how to feel relief. it is hard to make progress when you are constantly hating yourself. All suicide prevention stuff says contact a friend which I do not have and it makes me feel worse, like no one would care if I died. I really need help coping with this pain. How do I cope with the dark thoughts?",0
"I see all these successful trans women. They all pass. They manage to put on make up. They wear feminine clothes. And they pass.It destroys me mentally.

It only harms me and still I cannot stop does anyone know why that might be? 20 yo AMAB. Social media is always destroying me mentally and yet I do not manage to stay away.",0
"Anyone reliving past failures in your mind or feel really heartbroken the way life turned out? (Especially after waking up)It hits hard (almost unbearably) in the first 5 seconds of waking... it is like a unexplainable gigawatt jolt of sheer pain/anxiety/heartbreak/fear all at one time at the moment of waking. I can feel it physically in my chest and sometimes in my head (kind of hard to explain...not quite a headache but it is physical discomfort). Seconds later I get unfilterted replays of various painful past experiences in my mind. Each time I wake up, it is a different set of past experiences... different time periods of my past. Sometimes even a voice saying, 'And this is why you are now' in my head.it is like the few times I can shut out my brain from depressive thoughts is when I am asleep. I can have a dream of what I wanted to be my perfect past. Or have a nightmare of a past failure(s). Either way it is emotionally inciting to the point of euphoria. When I wake up...bam...my instinct is, 'dammit, I am waking up and facing the reality of my life, not this crap again.'Then for 10 mins after waking, I have to calm myself from the emotion. Sometimes I reflect on the dream and meditate my way out of the disappointment that it is not reality...or I reflect on nightmare and what that negative past did to me. If I do not remember the dream, it still takes a bit of time to shake off the 'waking anxiety' (As I call it). Those replays mentioned.This happens almost everyday. The anxiety/depression drops a lot after about 15 to 20 mins, but not entirely...it resonates at varying levels thoughout the day when I am awake. Need help with morning depression.",0

"Lately I am been going through almost daily battling depression and I am not sure how to fix it. I would say I have had major depression (not medically diagnosed) for about 2 months now, but its been slowly growing over the course of 6 months when I could still function. I moved from East to West coast of the US and thought I would be fine when I moved. However the past 2 months of living alone has been extremely tough on me.I have days where I have some semblance of ""normalcy"" where I can cook/prepare meals, clean, etc (do stuff I need to). But most days as of lately are just me sulking about my life situation and I barely have enough energy to even get out of bed or stand up. So its those odd days that still keep me going. Overall I have been having incredible feelings of **dread**, **hopelessness**, and **aimlessness**.**Dread** because I have had this idea in my head of how I want to live my life, but nothing is the way I want it. After college I wanted to move abroad and live in an rural foresty area. But, currently I still live in the US and live in an urban desert (Arizona). I strongly feel like I **do not belong here** but I accepted the job anyways since I need experience out of college. I hate cities, hate the heat, and hate driving; all things I have to deal with.**Hopelessness** because I have many things I want to do and improve on. But cannot get myself to do them; creating an endless cycle of berating myself. I distract myself with YouTube, video games, and talking with friends; which makes me temporarily happy but when I stop and realize where I am, I just break down.**Aimlessness** because I do not know what to do with myself. Even though I am working in a company that has nice and helpful co-workers/managers; I just do not care about the work and am only planning to stay here for 3 years to get experience. However, the 2 months I have been here the longer days feel. I thought I would make friends at work but am not putting in effort in making them, and so put myself in a lonely situation.I tried looking for therapy after I got insurance from my company but all have waiting lists since they are completely booked. I still apply anyways but am not hopeful for any help coming soon. Depression Worsening but feel lost on to fix it",0

"I have suffered from serve anxiety ever since I was 17 years old and I was diagnosed with depression once when I was 18 and I somehow managed to beat it back then. Anxiety never left me, it is been there ever since but I learned how to manage it. Now I am 23 years old, trying to get out of my parents' shelter. Unlike a lot of people here, I believe my problem is not with myself but the people in general. You might say that statement in simple words just means ""I have a problem with myself"" but I do not believe that anymore. I have not had a lot dark thoughts during these past 5 years but now it seems they are back. I have been contemplating suicide a lot lately. The only thing that holds me back is my family. I do not want to hurt my parents and my younger siblings because I know that would be devastating to them.I am ashamed at myself because I should be making my parents proud and be a good role model to my siblings and not be a crybaby on this subreddit but here I am. I feel hopeless. I lost some good friends, I hardly had any relationship that lasted longer than 3 months. I was cheated on and I was betrayed by people, even best friends I considered as brothers. it is like everything has happened to me, what is left?! I got in conclusion that this world is full of egoism, narcissism and cinism. I think trying to be a good person never works here. This world is full of hate and full of people whose only intention is to fucking destroy other people. I think there is nothing left for me here, absolutely nothing. Why keep living in such circumstances? Why live among these people? I feel such a stranger to everyone. I am tired. I am so tired of holding on. I am so tired of keeping these things inside. I am so tired of hanging around people acting like I am not crying every night and day. it is been two goddamn months, it is not leaving. I need to see a bright day for once ffs, this is cruel.

Number one and two: Are my kids. They could not function if I was gone. I am not going to abandon them like my dad did to me. I am not going to make them start from scratch with no support system. Number three: All the people who would have seemed to care if I was gone do not. When I lost my job after 16 years only three people I worked with even bothered to check in on me. This was after I had trained most of the managers there. Number four: Maybe it gets better. I met my person two years ago. The love of my life I think but we are both so damaged. I cannot be with her maybe ever even though I want to. So I hope it gets better later. I only have four reasons left I do not end it,1
"I know there is a hotline out there but I cannot ever bring myself to call it. I have been having a really tough time over the last few months. I was homeless for a little over a year during the height of the pandemic. I was sleeping on the local trail. I finally found a job with the Census and then, eventually, USPS. I moved to a different city and landed an apartment (with help of a local organization). Through it all, I did not have any support. My family (the ones I know of) have been dead and gone for years. Not that they would have been that much anyway. When I finally found a place to live and a job,, I thought things would be a lot better for me. However things just keep getting worse. Through my time being homeless, I developed bad insomnia. it is hard being a woman and homeless. I had people try to take advantage of me. I have had people try and bring me to their level (addiction; criminal activity), but I just kept my head down and to myself. I moved into this apartment where there was a trail of trash on both sides of the hallway, no hot water, drug dealers on the floor, no a/c and barely any heat, and landlords that are complete scum. You know I thought anything was better than the situation that I got out of, but I was wrong. The job that I had ended a while ago and I am struggling to find a stable job. I can only find contract work, but I am still able to make my rent. I have not really scratched the surface of everything that is going on.I found a grant that will help pay for me to go to school for an AS degree. I haven enrolled, but I just do not know if it is even worth hanging on. Nothing ever works out for me. NOTHING. I feel so much pressure constantly. I feel anxious and depressed and I feel like I just do not want to move forward. I still cannot sleep. I have made an appointment to try and get some help, but I do not know if I will go. what is the point? I really think I am bipolar with PTSD or something. I do not want to feel this way or anything anymore. what is the point",1
"I dunno where to start..I am a 16 yo boy, thankfully I still 've got a life to live but it feels meaningless... As a kid I did not grow up loving my parents or feeling something liie a connection between me and them.Sure I love them I guess but it feels empty. I just do not feel or experience those emotions that people talk about...I did not use to talk to them or even hang out with them because they did not tell me how to... Whenever I try to start a convo with them they do not pay attention and sometimes they do not listen at all... They just see me as a kid that does not understand shit and I have to listen to everything they say without them listening to me. I remember getting back everyday from school and they do not even care... All they say is go study and stop playing. Imagin that happening to you every single day till you are 16... It just hurts. I really really want to feel like a part of the family, I want to feel that love between each one of my family. Having no friends takes it to another level as you do not have nobody to talk or spend time with... I got to the point that i dunno how to talk... I just stutter and feel nervous all the time even if it is normal talk. I would say I have got depressed. I had social anxiety, anthropophobia which is the fear of people and pseudobulbar effect wich is being unable to control your emotions. I have got the point that I cry every single day on my pillow cuz no one knows how I feel inside of me. I see no people and always stuck at home 24/7 Cuz my parents refuse to let me go even for a walk. I remember mom calling dad cuz I was in my room for 14 days straight talking to nobody. I remember every single word my father told me and it went like: get out of your room and stop being dramatic, and also stop acting like little sad kids. These words... It just kills. I have never been able to talk or explain my feelings or my thoughts, I have never felt loved. Every single day I just tell myself that I would be better off dead. Cuz there is no point for me to live. I do not feel like I belong to anyone or anyone even cares about me. I hug my pillow when I sleep as if it was someone. I open my wardrobe and hug my clothes as if it was a person. I always think about suicide. I got to the point that I feel nothing... Nothing at all... It just feels empty... Dull.Plz if you r a parent and you are reading this... Love your children. Give them some love and care. They do not deserve having mental issues and suicidal thoughts. They should not open their wardrobe and hug their clothes as long as you exist. Just listen to them. I know it looks simple and will not do much but it does more than you think. Please.Thanks for reading all this. I feel nothing like if it is black and white...",0
As the title says: I am looking for a job and the jobs that provide some semblance of a work life balance and are actually in my field do not care.

"How can I stop relying on my close friends for emotional support? They are growing tired of me, and I feel like I am losing them.I overdosed on pills yesterday and was sent to hospital. I wanted to die. These people, some of my closest friends, deserve far better than me. They have their own demons to deal with and I just hold them back.Its my fault. I want to change. Really, I do. But I have no self-esteem. No confidence or the ability to tend to my own emotional needs. I want to feel loved, but we all have our shit to deal with, and there is only so much a person can give before the relationship withers away. I have been a terrible friend. Why did not those pills kill me? I should have died. At least, that way, I will not be a burden anymore. How to be stronger?",1

"I like to think that I am a proactive person. I believe that if you have unexplored options, you do not have a right to complain. But this is the second time in my life where I feel like I have absolutely no options left. I tried so many ways to be happy and to survive in the past year and they all failed spectacularly or simply evaporated. The crazy thing is that it is not even my fault, I did everything I could. Its the pandemic, it is the economy, it is our slow-ass indecisive bureaucracies, it is everyone being sad at the exact same time.I am talking to a military recruiter soon because I feel like it is my only option left in order to have any level of economic security. But everything else failed, so what is keeping this from not working out too? I have already come really close to killing myself in the past month and a half. I do not want to feel trapped, I do not want to feel like I do not have any options just to simply live. When you feel trapped, you are always one step away. I do not want to be there.

I sleep so much throughout the day and no matter how much I sleep I am always tired and in like a kind of hard to describe emotionally weird place but right now I am just sad because I am about to go to sleep again and I just said goodnight when I did not want to again I would rather be spending time with people I love I feel like I am disappointing everyone and making them feel like I do not care and I hate myself for it I feel like I am not a good girlfriend or friend,0
"I am so done with life. I am not funny, nor rich nor kind. I have not had any friends in years and cba living. I have no hopes making friends being antisocial, shy, introverted person.

"I just wrote about 1000 words about this and lost it thanks to a page refresh. FMLWell, tldr: putting in the work and the struggle to go on living rather than taking one's life, it is not that different. Living is the act of bringing about death. Working, getting terrible sleep, being stressed, eating poorly, sitting all day.. these things that I do in the name of fighting to stay alive and support myself, they damage my body and hasten death in much the same way as if I were intentionally self harming.

So I need help guidance on how to help my brother. So my brother who is 24 broke up with his girlfriend about 4 months ago ever since he has been down hill just about 3 weeks ago he opened up to me. He is a alcoholic drinks every day he is so depressed about his break up and I think that the root of this. He has cut him self multiple times. He drinks hard liquor now just to hide the pain. He tells me he wishes this would just go away. He said ever since he open about his depression and alcoholism to the family he feels more depressed. Today he has a appointment with a psychiatrist also I am trying to get him to go to AA meetings. But idk if I am to late because he is drinking at his job and he is drinking when he gets home. I am afraid he might kill someone and himself. Yesterday he told me that whatever happens happens and that he is not afraid to die. The big problem I see here is that when he is alone at his job a feel he looses the mental battle and seeks alcohol. I am afraid I am to late to help my little brother. Also I feel like my parents just tell him to man up and now I am responsible for him and if something happens to him its on me. I do not want to live with that burden. Idk what to do I could not sleep last night all I thought about was him. I have talked to him multiple times and every time he just breaks down and cries he is willing to seek help but I kind of since he is also suicidal. Idk what to do or what to say my anxiety is threw the roof. Any advice would be appreciated thank you. Need help!!!!,0

"Some of you may or may not have heard this term. Its people that are your friends when its easy or they have the time or they just do not have anyone else to be with. I am recovering from a bout of septic arthritis, if you do not know what it is that is cool, I did not either. let us just say it requires surgery, a fairly long hospital stay, and home IV drugs. None of these are fun. So as I am going through this, of course, there is an outpouring of Facebook well wishes and get wells, because these people are mostly further away or not close friends. I use the term close loosely. As I am in the hospital my mom flies in because yes its that serious. Anyone care to wager on the amount of friends that came to see me? One, just one. As grateful as I am that he came it was a huge gut punch that no one else even made an effort. Its made me really rethink what I have allowed friendships to be. I have allowed people to take me for granted and to be the equivalent of ramen noodles. Let me explainI hate ramen noodles. I buy a case of them and throw them in my cupboard in case of emergency ie: I am out of money, there is nothing else to eat, zombie apocalypse, that sort of thing. I have allowed myself to be ramen noodles, the emergency friend that is always available when you need them but otherwise you forget they are there when there is something better available. I find myself fishing for invites to things and still being left out and always being on the outskirts. I have been asking myself, what is wrong with me? Why am I not wanted? Why do not people that are not my family care about me? Why do I care so much about people that do not give a crap about me? I do not have an answer, but I do know that it has to stop. I am trying to get used to the fact that I may never find my gang or ever really belong anywhere. I think acceptance of this will be heartbreaking and I am not sure that I can come back from it. A life alone is not a waste but a life of being lonely seems pretty soul crushing. If you have fair weather friends, next time the wind changesjust let them go. Its a lot less painful and you can try to find some way to be at least content with your own company if you cannot manage happiness. Fair weather friends",0

"I am grateful for everything I have in life, I genuinely believe I am blessed. Yet, I feel empty and sad all the time. I never used to be like this until 2017. Its been like that for years now and it just will not go away. I had a expectation of how my adult life would turn out but I am still not satisfied. I was told, twenties would be your most fun, for me its the most depressing at most times. When I do enjoy life in the moment, it kind of gets ruined by the thought knowing it will not last forever. I am really grateful for my s/o, hes very supportive and understanding, yet I still feel constant sadness.. I am not suicidal but I always feel empty and nothing.

"lately I have been dealing with a lot of stress and very busy weeks that completely overwhelm me with the amount that is asked from me. and with lately i mean, pretty much the past years, but ever since a few months back, it is been more severe and i went from 58kg to 52kg unintentionally in only around 4 months. I have always been kind of skinny, but this makes me hate myself even more. i try to exercise and eat but i lack appetite and interest in food, and my body feels like bricks most of the time, so its incredibly hard to motivate myself to exercise. all i want is to just love myself more, but i cannot. everything around me in the world seems so harmful and i just feel so scared and hopeless in a world like this. i wish i could go back to the easier times. I have even had some days where i ate pretty well and even ate some snacks. i would feel confident and happy with myself. next week i would go and weigh myself being sure i must have gained some, and........ silence. lost weight again. it completely destroys that bit of confidence i had and makes me feel so upset. i do not know if I am asking for advice rn or if i just felt like sharing this, but anyone reading this, thank you. keep losing weight unintentionally.",0

"I am the worst human being to ever exist. i cannot carry on. my life is a complete mess and i cannot fix it no matter what i do. I have done everything and I am not changing. I have tried counselling but I am too scared to tell the truth and when i do they do not seem to catch on and give me advice that is just flat out useless, I have tried talking to close friends and family and they either do not care or are not any help, I have tried using different distractions and I am still so unbelievably miserable. so I am just going to kill myself instead because nothings going to help me anymore. and another thing, I have done so disgusting, so repulsive that i will never live down. i put a friend of mine, who is part of the lgbtq community, through serious emotional trauma for a ""joke"". i was not speaking to this friend much so me and a friend decided to be extremely homophobic to this person for the sake of a joke at on of eachothers houses. i did not really know what i was getting myself into until before we went into it and i told my friend i could not do it so i let them send all the messages to them to get a reaction out of them. instead of telling my friend its wrong and we should not be doing it at all because we both know better, i let them fucking do it instead and let them send all the messages to this person for a stupid fucking ""joke"". i hate myself. i cannot do this. its my biggest regret. i did not want to say anything incase i ruined the mood or made my friend go home. I am so fucking sorry. I am ashamed of myself in every way possible. it keeps me up at night. i wish i never fucking did it. not to mention i also have no real friends, I am not in good shape, I am ugly, I am lazy, I am extremely socially inept, no girlfriend, I am obsessive over people because i do not know how to control my feelings, I am despicable. so I am killing myself tonight. I have had enough. I have been suffering to fucking long. i just want someone to talk me out of it but no one will. if any of you see this please, feel free to talk to me, id really appreciate, or do not. but even then, i will most likely still end my own life later on tonight because i have nothing left to live for. the beautiful days of my life are long gone.

"Apologies in advance if this post is long, Ill try to have all the detail in as few words as I can.Quick background: I am about to be a junior in college, good home life, a lot of friends, very intelligent, plenty of struggles with anxiety but never anything too extreme.In September of 2020, I suffered a head injury playing pickup football with some friends. It did not feel serious at all and I was back in the game a few minutes later. The symptoms did not kick in for about 10 days.In hindsight, it was probably a mild concussion and nothing too major. However, I had no idea what I was dealing with, so I treated it probably exactly how you should not treat it. I worried about it constantly and pushed myself with school, partying, etc. there is not a lot of wiggle room when it comes to slowing down in the college life so I just continued to try to push on, which ended up being a bad idea. I was up and down with symptoms for about 6-7 weeks during this time.In late November, I suddenly crashed and everything went to shit again. All of the sudden in the course of a day I became totally dissociated and my brain fog increased tremendously. I thought it was nothing more than a symptom flair at first, but eight months later I still deal with these symptoms 24/7, and they have destroyed my life.I have done everything, seen all the doctors I thought would help, and nothing has given me any relief. I have been constantly dissociated since that time and my brain functions at a fraction of the capacity it used to. It makes life fucking terrible to live. I can still try and do things I did before, but I can never enjoy anything due to the way I constantly feel. My motivation is pretty much gone. Driving feels like a life risking activity every time I do it. School was next to impossible last semester and I am no better for this one coming up. My sleep has been horrendous since the injury and I was also recently diagnosed with Celiac disease (which I only found out thanks to the injury, so that is cool ig)The silver lining is that I think the problem here is that all the worry and anxiety has been trapped in my brain and the trauma surrounding the worrying is the issue rather than actual brain damage. I was not officially diagnosed with depression but one doctor thought that is what could be prolonging my issues. Even with this knowledge I cannot find any relief whatsoever. I really struggle to tell people this: first because its very personal, second because I struggle to share my feelings, and third because I have always been a guy to light up the room and now I have to act because I do not want to bring peoples moods down when they are around me. The people in my life know I am dealing with this but nobody knows the level of suffering I deal with mentally on a daily basis and I find it really hard to be honest about. I feel like my future is totally in jeopardy and I am very hopeless right now. I wanted to get this off my chest anonymously.",0

"Hi all. I think I might be on the verge of Suicide. I feel like I have run out of options. I do not live in a country that has free medical care (I cancelled my private insurance) and public hospitals are the most frightening thing ever here. (I live in a 3rd world country where if you go to a public facility you get abused/mistreated etc)I started taking antidepressants a few years ago for anxiety as it is what my partner wanted me to do as they were a Doctor and I had bad anxiety since a kid. We broke up, but I found it hard stop taking the meds as when I did I got terrible withdrawals. But eventually the side effects got so bad (I went to a Psychiatrist and tried various antidepressants but I just got worse and worse) that I decided to quit taking them and that was last September. The withdrawals were crazy and I felt super depressed after stopping them even though I tapered. A few months ago as I was still struggling so I booked myself into a rehab(super expensive) that dealt with coming off psychiatric medication. Worst idea ever, It was in the middle of nowhere and I was put with hardcore drug addicts and I cldnt just leave, plus it was semi-cultish. It was the scariest experience ever and now since leaving I still have the problems with withdrawal plus now I am traumatized and I have terrible sensations in my body as a result. Totally screwed up I knw. Anyway, I cannot do this anymore. I have tried reaching out to family but they are not really the helping type. I have pretty much been on my own since kid (ie having to be my own parent) and I am surprised I have even made it this far.I have written my goodbye note. Bought some gear. I have decided I am going to hike to the middle of nowhere and just die. Unfortunately my country has no social security and I feel so shitty I cannot possibly hold down a job. Plus in my country If you get a basic job like working at McDonald's you are pretty much living in a shack in dire poverty as it pays way to little to survive. I have some savings but I have decided that there is little it can do for me. I have lost my will to carry on fighting. In any case, I realised that with it I can actually make a difference in other people's lives instead on wasting it on mine. there is enough to build a house for a friend in Nepal, enough to send a girl in rural India to school and look after all her needs until she graduates, and enough to donate to a religious organization to do something substantial. I feel if I spend any more of it on me I am taking away from what it cld give someone else. I am also just tired and do not feel like I can get better. I feel completely alone and isolated. I used to be very social but lately I have withdrawn. I really think this is it. My biggest fear is becoming a ghost. I have been praying alot but I feel hopeless. I think I have got another day or two left in me. I tried to withdrawal all my money today so I cld donate it but I was told I have got a 24hr lock on my savings so I have to wait for that. I just pray that in my next life things are better. I have tried to live a good life I really have and always tried to live morally.So I am open to suggestions. This feels like it though. I would previously thought of suicide but never come this far before as to plan everything and decide where my money's going and how I will die etc. I have also left my apartment and am staying in a hotel close to the mountains and cut myself off from the world.Thanks for reading I think this is it",1
"Hi. How can I get myself motivated to work? I lost my job in December after working there for a year. Before that I had a job that I hated and got laid off from there too.

"I am barely holding on. The only reason I make it through each night is because I tell myself that the option to kill myself will always be there tomorrow. Since I was 17 years old, I have been dealing with what my doctor thinks is narcolepsy. I sleep all day and no amount of sleep makes me feel well rested. It feels like torture. I cannot afford to get the necessary sleep study to get it treated because I cannot hold down a full time job because of the amount of sleep I need each day. I just want to die to escape this hell. I am also in an abusive relationship that I do not have the energy to leave. He makes me feel bad any time I show any emotion or express how much I am suffering.

"We are not speaking for a month due to a break we are taking. Impossible for me to know whether we will stay together or not. In the meantime I am preparing myself for a breakup, even if I have some faith in the outcome. I have fought hard to reassure him about continuing together, but he is still lost about what decision to make. Beyond this I am afraid of a lifetime where I will never know if he is truly okay.Even if for a day it is easy to think he is not for me, I go to sleep crying because I feel the thought is cruel. He has been nothing but loving from the start and we were happy together. Our families liked each other. I love his so much. A few months ago I found out he has been suicidal for a long time. He told me his dark thoughts and it broke my heart. He did not want to talk about it and was upset that the whole thing came up, because it triggered him. We rarely ever fought, but now he says he cannot trust me. Now I pray to God for the first time so he gathers strength to overcome his depression because there is nothing else I can do.He continues to love me and want this relationship, but fears it might do him more harm than good. I want to do anything I can to prove I am strong enough for this and that I can be his support. I am afraid of what happens to him if he gives this up, which I understand is arrogant. There is no way to claim I am what he needs. But we thought we were going to be married one day. I am scared he is pushing me away. Viewed optimistically, the end of the relationship could diminish potential triggers and give him the space to focus 100% on himself, his way. All of my friends say I need to look out for myself right now. But what on Earth could my strength be for other than him, when he was the first to make life beautiful for me. Because of him I overcame my own depression and became so strong. I think I would be okay, I just would hate to settle for someone else. There is no knowing why he is depressed and what stops him from trusting me. Maybe he has some secret, I would suspect about gender. I would be with him no matter what. Anyone with advice, it is very welcome! I want to be there for him so badly, I am just not sure what else to do but be patient, I have done everything I can. I have cleared up misunderstandings. And again, maybe a breakup is just what makes sense. But this came out of nowhere. I trust he will find his way even if without me. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and he thinks he wants to split up.",1

Does anyone want to chat? I am trying to keep the thoughts away. I am feeling very suicidal tonight,1
"This mountain is where I found quite a large spot. A ton of height and just solid concrete at the bottom as it was by a parking lot. I found this spot years ago and think about it when I think about killing myself. Today I went to go find it. Not to end it all. Just to see it and I guess think. But I could not find it. There was a whole bunch of trees, no wya its gone but I do not know that was my escape plan for August. The only other idea I have is death by train but I I do not know I went to a mountain today",1
"This is a long read but it is needed for context.Also TW - Sexual assult(18M) - For the past 5 years I have struggled with my mood badly because of bullying and anxiety related to past trauma and stuff. In the past it has mainly been a reason out of my control as to why I have felt so crap. But since early last year it is been my own fault.I was in a fairly serious relationship with a girl. Of course, us being teenagers we were quite sexually active. However, I grew to almost expect the sex and in the end, one night it resulted in me misreading the situation completly and I sexually assaulted my girlfriend of the time. The person I cared about most and loved.Most people will probably read this as black and white and immediately judge me, as many of the people around me have. Ever since a rumour started going round at school I started losing some of my closest friends. Friends some of whom I had been close with since childhood. I do not blame them, these days there is a lot of pressure of not to be friends with someone who commited such a vile act.The problem I have had with myself is that, days after the incident happened and I was told through a mutual friend between my then girlfriend and I how she felt, I immediately went and called my girlfriend. (Since the pandemic had just begun so we could not see eachother face to face). On this call, I had the sudden realisation of what I had done and the seriousness of what I had done hit me all at once, resulting in me, someone already prone to anxiety, to have a full on panic attack where I voiced the worst case scenario that was in my head of:""Holy shit what I did was fucking illegal and I could go to jail. I could go to jail and my life would be over.""Of course, I was not thinking rationally at all and I was not thinking about the impact of my actions and how I should have tried to apologize properly or something different. The conversation we had did not achieve anything except do both of us harm. We would continue to date well into the summer until we ended it. From that day on I felt some guilt, to the point where I did not really fully quite trust myself and I was treading extremely lightly wherever I went. I did not feel the confidence to start another relationship at all and I was contempt with it feeling that perhaps a break is what I needed.Come the Spring of this year. In the UK there is been a huge surge in awareness about sexual violence and stuff due to the Sarah Everard kidnapping, rape and murder. A new ""testimonial"" site called ""everyone is invited"" gains a lot of traction on social media. Me being someone who usually sees themselves as an advocate for social issues and change and stuff, I decide to one day have a look at the website after a couple days. I am scrolling through reading all these horrible situations people have experienced thinking to myself, ""god this is so disgusting I cannot believe-"" and then I come across a story that sounds all too familiar. I knew immediately it was about me. I read the testimony in full, and then, did not know what to do with myself. Not only did I now feel ""exposed"" but new information had come to light to me regarding how my ex felt about the entire ordeal, including my tearful panic attack call. In the testimony it said she felt that I was only thinking about myself on the call, that I was selfish and had completely disregarded her completely in that conversation. Naturally I broke down into tears and could not sleep a wink that night with a million thoughts in my head about what I did, how terrible a person I was, I am a criminal and how I do not deserve to live anymore. It took 2 days for people in school to work out that the ""anonymous"" testimony had been written by my ex and how I was the disgusting perpetrator described in it. And from then on it has been a constant downwards spiral for the last 5 months. I have not been able to look in the mirror without thinking ""what a disgusting monster you are you do not deserve to breathe"" or whatever. You know, self hate. I have completely lost confidence socially since I lost all of my friends so I am second guessing every single person I meet even the bloody barista at a cafe thinking ""they know they know they know"". I cannot trust myself sexually at all. Any time I have an urge I get an overwhelming sense of guilt resulting in anxiety afterwards about ""I will never be normal and be able to enjoy anything again"". And then of course due to the nature of what I did I get the thought ""you deserve to feel like this, if you do not feel like this then you are not sorry and you are not forgivable"". I brought this upon myself so this time i deserve this depression. I do not know what to do with myself and I honestly believe that I deserve to die. And that is it. I have never felt this close to being able to kill myself before but... This time it really does feel like the right and only option.But hey... Thanks for reading my essay of my life right now... I just wanted somewhere to feel like I am being listened to since I have felt like I have not had a voice at all these last 5 months...TL;DR I made the biggest fuckup of my life and the guilt that has arisen from the peer pressure and myself has made my already pretty bad depression even worse. This time I brought it upon myself.",0
"I was working like a madman. This meant traveling all over the world, constantly worried about deadlines and sales quotas, and just living one to-do item after another. The year would fly by and I would not know where it went, but I was not depressed, I was engrossed.But it was a bad thing because it was fulfilling the goals I wanted for myself. I was just a slave to the corporate machine.Ironic.Slavery or despair. Those were my only two choices. Somebody should have told me. The only time I was not depressed in life was when",0
"Really struggling. I do not know where to begin..I have always had challenges. I have now been diagnosed with Bpd, which come with a bunch of friends; depression, ocd, attention deficit. Up until two years ago I was bumping through life, but then I lost my job, lost my house and was abandoned again! I have been trying to rebuild ever since. I tried to start training for an alternative career, then the pandemic hit. Back in June 2019 I was the closest I have ever been to taking my life. I made a promise to myself that I would wait at least one year to see if things improve. They are now worse than ever, two years on. I wished I had ended it then at least I would not have had to have lived through the suffering of the last 2 years. I am paralyzed by fear. But... I kept going, because that all I know. I re-trained into a different area, but am petrified to take the next step. I graduated with As. I have always had the security of being employed before - not doing it on my own. I would be dead already if I was not riddled with the guilt which it will leave on others. I just want to sleep forever, I cannot handle being in my own skin. I have tied to get help but have had very little, success. My last relationship has not been a good, I have just not wanted to leave because then I will have nothing. I just do not know where to turn. Professionals do not help. I have stopped talking to friends through fear of being blackmailed by my partner, who has threatened to call my parents in another country and send emails to my friends divulging very personal information.I live in constant fear and misery. For three weeks I have filled out diary cards. I have had one day, where I felt joy briefly 1 out of 10. This is no way for a human to live. every night I prey I will not wake up the next day.. everyday I wake up with a massive gasp of anxiety and affliction - as I once again reform the miserable predicaments, which are my life and know I cannot change it because I am flawed. Struggling!",0
"My whole family and friends know I want to end my own life. I love them to death and they are doing everything in their power to keep mee happy in alive but sometimes it just feels like sometimes it just feels like I am being talked to like a baby and it makes me feel worse and worse anyone else experience this?

"i have come onto this community before and posted, but soon deleted it after 10 minutes or so. i decided to come on here again, as more time has passed since my episode and my thoughts are more collected. i woke up this morning to my mom barging in my room telling me to wake up, like always. me having to lie about going to sleep at eleven instead of telling the truth about how i broke down at 2 am. i feel guilty. I am in a loving family but somehow feel numb. almost like a doll. an empty she will brought to life to fool those who watch the show. i could never tell anyone in my life i feel this way, as my hard work would collapse. they would never look at me the same. my straight a's, academic and athletic accomplishments, gaining people's trust, people knowing they can come to me, me. i need to be reliable. this hollow she will somehow seems easier to play out then showing my sorrows to my beloveds. i could not. i do not think i can take it. i do not want to worry my mother, she already has too much on her shoulders. i can take it. I am fine. everything is fine.it feels a little lonely now a days. everything is... crumbling.**i will probably delete this soon, but thank you for listening. i feel a little hollow inside.",1
"I do not have a dentist. I do not have any ""healthcare"" (I do not think anyone does, actually). I called around hoping to get a prescription for penicillin or erythromycin hoping I could get a dental appointment. Everyone assumes that people are lying and using an abscess as an excuse to try to get opiates. I am in a lot of pain. A lot. This tooth looks like the jagged top of a mountain erupting from my gums. I look like I got punched in the jaw. I need a prescription for anti-biotics. I cannot get it. They would prefer I die. And at this point I hope I do. I fucking hate all of you. You fucking selfish, greedy, fucking monsters. I wish my death could mean something. It means nothing. I am just worthless, stupid sack of human fucking garbage. I have an abscess and want to die",1
"Hello, I am 18 and I have reasons to believe I may be suffering from depression. I have absolutely no motivation for anything, I often feel sad and lonely especially at night. I have difficulties to sleep and to awake on the morning and I am always getting angry for nothing. Sometimes I just hate everyone for being lonely.. And I have no hope in the future, I am convinced I will fail in my studies.. there is almost no day when I do not think I would rather be dead or wish I was never born. I do not feel connected enough to anyone to talk to them..I tried to tell my friends but they did't seem to care or to took it seriously. I think the only reason I can talk here is because English is not my mother tongue so it kind of feel unreal even though I know you are real people (I would probably not say those things in French even online) and since I know you will not judge me. And I particularly cannot talk to my parents because I know they would either do not care, judge me or laugh at me..I would like to see a therapist, but I feel like or world is not worth living in so I sometimes think I should not try to get better.. I cannot tell my parents I think I am depressed",0
"I do not want to fail again, all I have done since I have been alive is fail or fuck up I am just tired and I want to end it all I do not even care if it hurts anymore I just want to be gone I do not sleep I feel nauseous when I see food I hate my body and my self more than ever, I do not feel like anyone cares the only thing that makes my life feel like I need to stay longer is my first child is on the way but my partner just does not care about how I feel or how I am feeling about my life our life, she just tells me to go back to my family who let me go homeless until I met her. I do not want to make anybody disappointed in me but I do not think Ill do anything worth being alive for I cannot do anything anymore I do not want therapy or meds I did that and it just made it hard to move I still have thoughts of hurting myself and rotting I am so sad and tired I do not want to be me anymore I cannot keep feeling feelings I do not want to be here but if I die Ill still make everyone disappointed I do not care what people are going to tell me I just cannot keep bottling up I am so close to hurting myself and ending it I am tired and overwhelmed but no one cares I want to be dead. I want to boil. I am so tired of seeing my face hearing myself breathing I hate eating I hate food I hate everything I want to be dead i hate people. I hate life I do not want to but I do not want to be alive anymore",1
Hey to anyone out there. This is my first ever post and I am on my phone so I am sorry if this is not done correctly. I do not exactly know what I am hoping to get out of writing here. I guess I just needed somewhere to talk where it would not feel completely irrelevant. Lately it kind of feels like I am shouting into this black void hoping someone might say something back to me but its just echos of myself. I feel so so unbelievably alone every second of every minute of everyday. I have had diagnosed depression since I was 14 (I am now 25) so I know this will pass. I know Ill be okay. And I know that soon Ill be happy. But I feel empty. I am so sad and so exhausted from having to pretend to be okay because I cannot burden anyone. Whenever I try to talk to a friend it turns into me being their therapist and hearing how badly they have it. It makes me mad because its selfish. And then I feel horrendously guilty for being mad. I told my friend I had to cancel our plans and when he asked why I was honest and said it was because my depression was really bad and my intrusive thoughts about suicide (I have no desire to die. My doctor explained to me its my brains way of giving me an out. Fight or flight). He then spent forty five minutes telling me about how depressed HE is and how I am the only one he can talk to. I felt like I was drowning. To put all of that on me he would not even go to a doctor or a professional. He just expected me to take care of it. That was two months ago and I have tried to distance myself. I had another friend telling me how she tried to overdose on pills. And another asking me to go with her to get a restraining order. Its so much weight on me. I have absolutely nothing to give to anyone. I barely have anything to give to myself. I have my own struggles and I am trying to work through my very first real heartbreak and I am embarrassed that I am as sad as I am over it. Its just been hard. I am going to try to start going to therapy again. It helps to talk which is why I came here. I have no one right now. Sorry this was such a rambling mess. I just wanted someone somewhere to hear me and know how I feel. I do not know why. I guess sharing my feelings gives them validity somehow. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read. I appreciate it.Sorry again if I did not do this right. Its become a struggle,0
I try to give hints that I am not ok but it seems like people notice and ignore it. I told my mom about my anxiety and now she acts like it just does not exist. It seems like I am that one person that everyone looks over or nobody cares about and it makes me want to kill myself sometimes. At this point I am waiting to get the impulse or urge because I want to die but i will not do anything about it. I know i should tell someone and open up but I am afraid of oversharing or that people will not take me serious. i feel alone but its my fault,0

"In 2020,covid happened. Living a third world country and everything is already shit. The country fell into recession. Everyone literally had no job. Then,2021 came it. Covid almost gone in country. Everything started to get better. But in February,coup happened. The country is getting a little bit up from recession and coup dragged us down back. Everyone is dying everyday. Everyday is just pure depression. And about a week ago, covid third wave happened which is alot stronger than previous waves. People dying from running out of oxygen. So,we have to buy oxygen tanks. And then,military took over almost every oxygen tank and mask manufacturers and stop manufacturing. There is no hope. I do not even how I will die. From military or covid? I hope some powerful country just nuke us and die within a second without feeling anything. I wish I could just die painlessly and peacefully.",0
"Because I woke up. I do not have the strength to permanently stop the waking up or the desire to do that to my parents and siblings. My life feels like it just exploded and I am not sure about my marriage and what is scaring me is what I am thinking. How my mind is working lately. I hate the person I have become. And I have been victimizing myself about all this when it was my responsibility to take care of myself and walk away from the fucking company that my husband chose over me. Over and over again. While at work using and abusing me for his company. But, I made the mistake of trusting, you know, my fucking husband.I know this is jumbled. I am all over the place, unstable, and need a babysitter because I am afraid of myself right now.I am lost, defeated, and completely hopeless. I wake up angry every day",0
"I am sick and tired of people bullshit. I love how I can be talking to a women for a few months go on dates and everything and be having a good time. But soon as they realize that I get attached easily. Also that I am insecure about the relationship and need reassurance every once awhile becuase I have been cheated on numerous times and been fucked over by family and friends, they just up and leave without a fucking care in the world. I just cannot do this shit anymore. Honestly I wish I could just fucking die and not need to worry about it anymore. Becuase I fucking hate being lonely it is the worst feeling in the world for me and I just do not fucking understand the double standard in life. It is fine for a woman to act like this in a relationship but soon as a guy does it, he is practically trash to them. I regret joining the marines now just becuase of how mentally fucked the left me when I got out and I just want to be done with it. Fucking done with everything",0

I do not have to pretend in my room. My bedsheets have not been changed in weeks. It is so cluttered that you cannot see the floor. The spot on my bed where I sit is dented and stained. When I get back to my room I do not have to pretend to be happy or pretend to have friends. I do not have to interact with anyone. I can just sit and not be bothered. No one can see my when I am in my room so I can just let it all go. When I step out of my room all I do is pretend,0
"My adopted parents and I have not gotten along in awhile due to my depression. They constantly act like I can get up each morning, take care of myself, find a job etc. I cannot I have told them time and time again I cannot.. they even lied to my therapist about it. They want to move out in less than a year now to retire and Ill have no where to go. Ill lose my health insurance so all the medicine I need to take each day will be gone. I told myself so many times the moment I am homeless is when Ill find a way to die. They care about their happiness more than they care about me.. I am tired of them lying to me telling me they care then turn right around and do something that proves they do not. My only chance of living is trying to apply for disability but they are so against it I just know they have sabotaged it some how so I am probably going to get denied over and over. I have told them my plans and they brush it off and think I am not serious. you can threaten us with that all you want. Etc its not a threat its a fact I am telling you what is going to happen to me because I know how I am I never asked to live and suffer like this.

"I have been meaning to talk about what is going on with my life (in the hopes that idk someone can help or confirm that my life should be at an end). For the past month now I think I have been shut off from my friends and family, delaying what needs to be done (aka suicide) and now that I am planning to do it (again) I am stuck trying to write my suicide note. I know that I need to do it to relieve my family's problem and stop this never ending cycle of getting better then shutting off then doing all over again (that is the best way I can say it ig ""shutting off"" because dk if it is a mental breakdown). I know I am never going to get better but my family still has hope and keeping that hope longer will only hurt them more because I know how this ends. It will be either I succeed this time because pills were not enough so this time will hopefully work because it is a rope or I fail and will be forced to therapy and maybe get better for a while then be back here again. I have tried everything medication, exercise, a stable diet, and therapy, but obviously it is not working so what is the point? I am forever stuck like this... things will never get better, the storm will never end, and I am wasting resources and time of the people who care about me. I know I have to write this suicide note I owe it to them. it is really difficult to write a suicide note",0

"July has been a pretty shitty month for me and I am so sick and tired of my mental health problems. I have been mentally and emotionally unwell for way too long and nothing I do seems to help. Therapy, medication, change of environment, new hobbies, new friends, and even succumbing to my past self-destructive behaviours nothing. I would do anything to make this feeling go away, I just desperately want to stop feeling so numb and depressed all the time. I do not know what to do anymore",0
"I do not have anyone to talk to in person, at least no one I feel close to.

When I am riding my bike I wish I come across an accident and die. When I sleep I wish that peacefully pass away.

I left LA due to the fact that rent was high, and all of my work had become remote due to the pandemic, so I saw an opportunity to save a lot of money. However, following a breakup, I have been pretty depressed. However, I cannot help but wonder if some of this depression is due to living at home. My parents are not overbearing and they have been very accomodating, but I am starting to wonder if living with them is not good for me mentally. I have always valued my independence and liked living in bigger cities where I am surrounded by people like me.Before moving home, the primary problem was anxiety and panic.

"I wrote this on the bipolar reddit this morning. well now i do not want to exist. I cannot do what i want to do because i do not have the mental stability. I have nobody to talk to about this shit. I only have family. Well that is not enough anymoreI cannot succeed in school but i have to in order to not become homeless. I cannot get a job at 21 years old because I am too socially anxious. I am just worthless. I want to hire a hit man to kill myself or something. I just want to die but i do not have it in me. I feel like an attention whore. I am so drained I am looking up the same shit i used to at 14. I take xanax for anxiety and i wish it sedated me but it does not. No matter how much i take i feel the same. I have taken 16 mgs at once and its done nothing to me. I just want to feel nothing. I want to be out of everyone is life. I make people feel shitty and it fucking kills me. I feel like I am trying to crawl out of my skin.I have been taking 100mg seroquel for four days. I am in a weird situation right now and its really difficult to explain but I am going to try. My dad met someone on minecraft about ten years ago and long story short, they hit it off, became friends, and started a business together. She lives in australia and we live in the US. she is married with a kid and she is been really nasty to my family. She is in control of every aspect of his life; finances, has camera with audio in the living room of his house (they own it for air bnb together), Gps on him, and has tried to buy the love of my brothers and I. Well for a short period i lived in that house rent free which i appreciate. I got kicked out after a manic episode and have been exerting all my engergy trying to get back into that house and pay monthly rent instead. she is decided that she wanted to create a plan for success but its all under her terms. On day four of taking these meds i realized i do not want to live under her roof. If I am going to pay to live somewhere then it makes more sense to me to spend more on rent elsewhere due to the emotional turmoil she is put me through. I am 21 years old and I think that this is the end of the road for me to try and repair my dad and is relationship. He has let this woman that i just found out hes romantically involved with (which to me makes everything far more twisted) someone who has hurt his family so much. This devastated me so much. I want to know if this is me thinking for myself for once, or an impulsive thing. I have had to live at the house i was r**** in for two months while she decides if i should be allowed back. The reason i was kicked out due to a manic episode was because i wanted to go to the hospital for inpatient because i had not gotten a wink of sleep in nearly a week.

"does anyone else constantly make commitments or plans in the heat of a good day and then when you actually have to do it realize how much energy it is going to take and the regret kicks in?i volunteered to help little kids put on a musical and it is everyday this coming week from 9am-4pm and even later for the show on friday. and i have work right after 2 or 3 of those days. i was really happy and excited when i joined on like a month ago, but my mental health has taken a sharp decline and I am swiftly falling into a depressive episode. and now i just cannot imagine doing that this week. i cannot sleep because i cannot stop thinking about everything in my life that is going wrong and i literally just want to sob and sleep forever thinking about this coming week.i do this all the time, why!!!! making commitments you know you will barely have the energy to go through with",0
"I had brought a friend over to bring some food but it did not go as planned. Not only did they come in the house, but my aunt and uncle happened to be there and my friend accidentally told them about the time I had gone over to his house without their knowledge. do not get me wrong, I fully understand why they are upset about me going without their knowledge, but what is the point of telling them anything? They get angry over the littlest things to the point where I do not feel comfortable talking to them about myself. Not only that, but Jesus I felt extremely uncomfortable with my whole family being there with my friend. I have learned to just listen to what they say and stay away from friends. I really quit I do not give a shit anymore about seeing them. This contributes more to my stress and self hatred even though I know what I did was wrong. All I do is upset people me being gone would give my family and friends so much relief. Never again.",1

"I have been very active here recently but having somewhere to vent, somewhere where I do not feel alone makes the feeling alot easier on me I guess. This is not entirely related to the post, I just wanted to express my appreciation for this subreddit. Its helped me alot.That being said I just saw a post on here, someone talking about being ""snapped out of it"" because they realized how much it would hurt their kid and it made me think about why I have not done it yet.My two brothers. One older than me and one younger than me. The older one tells me all the time that when I was born it snapped him out of suicide. His attempts were stopped by me crying as a baby, or even when I annoyed him he still loved me and wanted to stick around to see me happy or even just to annoy me. My younger brother has never expressed the desire to kill himself to me before, like I did to my older brother brother; but I have similar reasons. Truthfully, I like to fuck with him. Sometimes the funniest part of my day is me walking into his room, flicking his forehead and walking out. he is one of the funniest people I know and I know my death would ruin him. I have two sisters, neither if them are super in my life so I do not know for sure how my death would impact them but it helps to think they would be devastated too. I have a niece. she is a year and 7 months old and she is the cutest thing to exist. She cannot talk but I love my moments of communication with her. We play games together even though she cannot speak. Some sort of variation of simon says where she waves her arms and claps her hands wanting me to copy her. Sometimes she will turn of the tv when I am watching and look at me and laugh at me. Sometimes she does things and when I tell her to stop she looks at me and does it anyway. I want to see her grow up. she is so smart right now and I love how she is right now and I want to see her get older and I want to tell her stories about right now and show her videos of how she liked to just fuck with her aunt or how she would kiss her reflection.Sometimes this does not work. Sometimes I relish in the feeling that if I did commit suicide right now, people would be devastated. Sometimes I feel like that is the only time I will be loved by everyone unconditionally, and I feel like at my funeral, when it finally sets in, everyone will realize what they did wrong and feel remorse. Sometimes I think that if I died right now maybe in the afterlife I will have everything I want, including what makes me happy now. Maybe if I just did it I could have my cake and eat it too.This is a hard reason to have, because sometimes its my reason for wanting to kill myself and sometimes its my reason for staying alive. I want a better reason. I wish this was not my only reason but its kept me here for 9 years. Maybe if I had a better reason, the 9 years would finally be over and I could just live and be happy but for now I guess it will do. I wish I could find a better reason but if it works it works I guess.",1
"Is not simply because I want to do more things that I could, but because I have been inside of my head so long- day dreaming, that I want those things that I cannot have. The things that dream me has. The only main difference in my dreams in comparison to reality is me. I look better, I feel better and I act better. All of those end up with an entirely different life than what I live. They are also in-achievable. I cannot accept who I am in any way. A reason I cry when I think about killing myself",0

"I am suffering from depression and have been taking professional help as well. I have a few really bad days where I feel like though I want to get my work done, I am unable to as I have no motivation and I just want to lie down or sleep. This makes me question myself, is it really depression who is making my task impossible or am I using depression just as an excuse to avoid work. I am confused, anxious and frustrated with myself all the time but since I am on meds, I am able to have a little control over my emotions.I think I had Depression since my teenage years but it was left undiagnosed. I have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work. Which reinforces my doubt that maybe I am faking depression as I can use it as an excuse as I am not making progress in getting out of it and maybe I like to stay in depression so I do not have to do any work. But at the same time I never tell anyone at work that I am depressed so maybe I am not faking after all. Everything is so confusing. Whatever this is, I do not think Ill ever be able to get out of this phase. I do not want to stay depressed but I cannot get myself out of it",0

I just want to live a normal fucking life and be able to shake stupid stuff like this off, but I do not even know anymore.

Right before telling me I need to put five people on a safety plan to help ensure I am safe. Relying on friends for emotional support has destroyed every single friendship I had. But hey, at least this situation is the gold standard... Ugh. The last person on my safety plan asked to be removed.",1

I am trying my best not to hurt myself again or attempt. But its so hard. So so so so so so so hard. I am trying, I promise I am trying. I am scared. I do not know what I am rambling on about. I do not know why i am. I am just so scared. I am sorry for this entire thing. I am sorry. I know everything I said sounds very small and irrelevant and i guess it is but the main problem are not those its just my mind. I feel like its just a stormy blurry mess with so many bad thoughts.

I felt like we had connected and I finally had someone on my side and someone I can rely on and talk to for support and trust. i felt like a weight off my shoulders. turns out she went and told my sister straight away. my sister and i had many problems in the past, did not talk for a few years and recently reconnected. my sister said to me that my grandma is really worried and that she basically told my sister everything i said. i said some very vulnerable things. things i do not even mean anymore and just very depressive things. i got annoyed straight away. everything i said was supposed to be private. my sister said i should have told my grandma i wanted it private. i think me crying and breaking down was enough to know this should be private. anyway now i feel more alone than ever. hope my depression was good gossip for them. had a mental breakdown on call with my grandma and she told my sister everything",0

I would go out and try and meet people but i struggle talking to people (I have had social anxiety since i was 6) I just sit at home all day, work, and play pointless games.

"I started meds a few month ago, Wellbutrin, they worked before just fine. But my anxiety was getting to the point where it was making my so depressed. I felt hopeless, like I would live with a sore chest forever, snapping short gasping breaths. My therapist thinks it is the meds, my doc disagrees. We put me on a new anti-anxiety med, Buspirone. it is made the depression so much worse. Within a week I feel like I just want to give up and die. I am sitting in my rehearsal right now. I am a professional musician and doing really my first real, almost normal, gig since COVID started. I am with all my dear friends doing awesome music and having a blast. But I am singing and behind mask in crying. No matter where I have ever been. The lowest pit I have been in. The worst amount of circumstance this has never happen. I have never wanted to stab myself in the chest while singing. I feel like life has been way worse for me before. I have been in much more depressing and anxious circumstances. I feel like these suicidal thoughts are not real. I feel they are not authentic. Are they chemically manufactured? I should be happy. But I just want to die.

"I think I have an eating disorder, and here is why.I think it started at the end of my final year of secondary school. I lived fad away from my school and there was no buses in my area so every morning and every evening I would walk 5 miles every day, which is a lot of cardio to be doing 5 times a week. I would also not eat in the day. I would skip breakfast because I would be exhausted and would not wake up early enough to make breakfast (during this time I was late to school a lot) and then I would skip lunch and I would have a small ""healthy snack"" for morning break like an apple or a packet of sunbites. Then I would go home and not have anything to eat until dinner, and I would not finish my dinner. (I would also force myself to drink a lot of water throughout the day)Now I have left school I am on this journey to ""glow up"" or ""get healthy"" but I just feel like I am making myself sicker. I have certain foods I have stayed away from for OVER A YEAR (so now I feel like this eating disorder has been here for longer than 3 months...) I cannot eat flavoured yoghurt because my brain says ""that has pure sugar in it"" I cannot drink cordeal like Vimto because my brain says ""that has pure sugar in it"" bro even orange juice, but I can compensate with my rain with orange juice because my brains says ""even though orange juice is PURE SUGAR...it has vitamins so you can drink it :)"" eating white bread makes me have this insatiable feeling of guilt but I eat white bread because its what my family eat and I do not want them to be suspicious. My brain says ""white bread will kill you early"" also, I do not eat cereal (except bran) because I believe that has too much sugar in it. I do not eat processed meat anymore like ham because it makes me feel guilty or when I DO have it because I do not want to make my family suspicious i feel that insatiable feeling of guilt again. EVEN WHOLE MILK MAKES ME FEEL GUILTY. I also hate when my parents buy junk food because I have to eat that...it takes over my life, and everyday I obsess over what I will eat and if it will be ""healthy enough"". Every one of my meals has to have a vegetable or fruit on it and I have to drink a lot of water STRICTLY JUST WATER EVERYDAY or I get anxiety. Its controlling my life...what do I do? I am sixteen years old if anyone wants to know. I think I have an eating disorder",0

"Here I am, once again to rant about me being obsessive? I do not know how to put it. Well yeah, obsessive is a good enough description. I have been stuck on this specific person and regardless of how much I am supposed to be far from them I keep trying to attach to them as if they will attach to me back. We used to be great, both attached until drama happened and now its one sided. I open up my feelings and she just replies with one line. She has told me she does not trust me, so why the hell do I trust her? MY MIND IS CLOUTED. I AM, SUFFERING. With a heavy stone weightening my heart, and my friends being scared away from me being obsessive I honestly do not know what to do. I do not want to talk to her even so why do I exist? Why do I have to live? Why do I have to od what I do in order to do. DRUGS ANTI PSYCHADELICS ARE USELESS. Well useless is incorrect terminology but I AM STILL IN PAIN.

Many trees, bushes, animals, flowers, insects, mountains, if you want mountains, you get it.Now imagine you are a tree. What tree you want. What color you want, shape, I do not care. But a tree, of any kind.Now imagine your place. Anywhere in the forest.And, the last thing, imagine a wind. A very powerful wind, going through the whole forest. And, what do you do ? Do you fall because of the wind ? No, you do not. Whatever kind of tree, color, place or shape you have, you are not going to fall. Not a single tree falls from any forest when there is even a thunderstorm.So, why would you ? If life hits you, and keeps getting worse, maybe you are not strong. Maybe you are weak. Ugly. Fat. Weird and dumb. But you cannot fall. Only if you want to.Nothing can happen to anybody if they do not want to.

"I really struggled to write this honestly. About a year ago, I had an accidental overdose that caused a seizure and stroke. I was in the ICU for 9 hours unconscious before I finally woke back up. It was terrifying and I am happy I survived the ordeal. However, there are days when a nasty little voice in my head stats that maybe I do not deserve to be here. That I should have just died and it would have made everything easier on everyone else. I would never act on it because I do not want to die, but there have been times when I am literally in a hole where I have thought that maybe it is right and I do not deserve to be here. I feel so lost.... Sometimes I Think It Would Have Been Better If I Had Died.",1
"// Sorry if this whole post is a mess, my mind is a huge mess atm // Anybody out there who grew up without proper adult supervision or is currently doing so? Man, if you are, I have deep respect for you and you deserve nothing but the best in life. I live this way too and it is the worst. I am currently 15 years old and I have been living without proper adult supervision for nearly 3 years. People might think living with no house rules, no discipline, no anything might be the best, but it is nothing like that for me. Basically, I live with a lazy cousin who does almost nothing else but play games and shit even though he is 22. And my guardians who are supposed to be taking care of me are miles away from the house I live in. For the past couple of years, I have been raising my own self aside from financial support (which I am thankful for but it is not enough), pretty much trying to figure everything out all alone. Before this all happened to me, I had a pretty normal life, wherein I was kind of dependent on my parents on everything. But I mean, c'mon, parents are there to give children what they need - time, love, and their basic needs, you know. So moving onto this kind of lifestyle after I lost my parents was really tough. I had to deal with mourning their loss, moving into a new city, school, home, changing my lifestyle completely, and leaving my friends, my old house all behind altogether. And I was pretty much alone throughout all of it because nobody my age could understand how I felt, and my guardians who are supposed to be looking out for me kind of always just leave me alone. Sure, it might not be the hardest thing ever for some people, but it really has been for me. Fast forward to nearly 3 years of living this kind of life, it is only gotten worse. The house I live in is always under heavy neglect because of my failure to keep up with all the chores, and my cousin literally not helping but just adding to the mess. The dishes always pile up, we seldomly take out the trash so that piles up too, there are so many containers in the fridge with unfinished food that has been there for several months, the back area is infested with insects and snails, parts of our rooves are leaking, our gardens are ridiculously overgrown and were always late on restocking groceries, etc. I could keep going on and it just gets worse and worse. To add to that, we do not eat healthy foods and only eat 1-2 times a day, we just eat processed foods or fast foods, plus we do not get any exercise either. Our lives are disgusting, and I really wish I had the strength to persevere and change our lives but.... it is been so tough being in all of this alone. I always try to initiate changing our lives, but every time I do so, hoping I would motivate my cousin to help me, he does not help me. He still stays lazy while I try and fix our lives and it really takes a huge toll on me and always affects my progress because I just wish he would help. Lately, I have been dealing with so much more to the point I have nearly attempted to leave the world for good several times. I thought, I just rather be with my mom now. This is because my aunt who lives halfway across the world decided that I was going to get two puppies. do not get me wrong, I love dogs so much, but they are not suitable for the kind of lifestyle I have right now. And now I feel so overwhelmed with how untidy and messy our house is, but the dogs are already here. I feel so bad for them, I feel like they deserve a much better home. And it is also been a struggle to take care of them personally. Because I feel like I am failing them and not providing everything they need. they are both big breed dogs, which I have never had so everything with them is a new experience for me. I feel like I am not giving them the proper lifestyle they need so it is been so stressful. Plus, again, as expected, my cousin is not helping. He does not even at least pet them or play with them, you know? And it hurts me so much. I live in a middle to upper-class town but my life is pretty close to how people in poverty live or even worse, because at least some of them still manage to have fun and have loving families. This place is the most depressing place I have ever seen and lately, I have just realized how emotionally neglected I am. it is been nearly 3 years since my mom passed away but I have not even gotten close to moving on. The thought of her being gone has been and still is so heartbreaking and always brings me to tears. And nobody in my family has bothered to sit down with me and ask me how I am doing or how I am coping. it is just been so dead in the house I live in, especially for the past year and a half in quarantine. My cousin and I barely talk unless we go outside to run errands. He just stays in his room all day and does not bother helping out with the house. I swear to god, I have contemplated just going away for good so many times. This fucking life is horrible and I want to escape so badly and be with my mom in heaven. The only thing that is stopping me now are my dogs, I love them too much now to leave them behind knowing that they might not be taken care of properly. So I really am trying my best to muster up the strength to fix my life, without the feeling of needing my cousin to be as productive as me. But I just find it so hard, depression just does that to you, I guess. I just wish things get better and I wish I continue to fight for myself and my dogs. Ps. I am not really looking for pity, we all have our own tough challenges in our lives, and this is my battle to fight. I would absolutely appreciate it though if those with the same experiences comment down below and let me know how you managed to get out of it and get better. Or at least what you do to cope. I am 15, and I have been realizing how emotionally neglected I'am by my family.",0
"Back then when I dreamed myself achieving something like doing great on a competition or just a simple exam, I used to see my face.

"Hey everyone!.Back here after a few months lolSo yeah idk how much to disclose here.let us just go with crippling anxiety and no direction in life ?.

Not a single anxiety free day and it is fucking july.Anyone interested in a last ditch effort to make things better??. We can try to work towards our goals and try to survive the remaining part of the year. And if we fail, we can always kill ourselves at the end.Suicide is inevitable at some point right.

"Hi, I am a 29 yrs old man, I am married with a wonderful woman and we have a little girl. The problem is that I feel depressed, I started with some ideas that maybe I am not good enough. I see my body on the mirror and I do not like it (Including sexual aspects), I think that I am not the best economic provider for my family, and all this get me to think that I am so immature and maybe my wife will be disappointed. I am scared that maybe she miss somebody else, maybe she thinks about somebody else from her past, some stuff like that. I have even compared myself in those ideas, even without having met anyone from her past, as stupid as it sounds. She has never say anything about that, nor has acting like that, never. She know some of this and try to support me. I never felt like this in the previous years, this started about three months ago and it is a hell that tortures me every day, since it causes me to think all the time about ideas, to think that there is something more, to overthink details than in they are not really like that.I am conscious that the problem is me, with this insecurity, with this ridiculous ideas, but I do not know how to deal with them. I know that I have to go to therapy, and I am actually looking for some therapist on my city, but I wish to know if there is a way to block all these ideas in day to day. I just want to stop all of this because I do not want it to scale on something else, I do not want to affect my marriage, and I want to be plenty for me and my loved ones. Insecurity issues",0

"Hey everyone. I am currently 21 and was diagnosed with GAD and PTSD about 2 years ago. that is just from my therapist after about 2 months of sessions. I am never really able to open up to people, especially those with some type of authority or the people you are supposed to trust. I never mentioned all of my trauma because I feel like I am not really ready to deal with it. The important people I opened up to refuse believe me and think I am lying or exaggerating. I am not a liar though, my abuser lied to my parents about me and they believed him because he was the adult in charge (he was a coach). Even to this day they see how much has come out about him and they refuse to believe anything serious happened (I think its their own guilt so I get it but still). Nobody took the time to actually see me and try to help before I became an adult. I have a lot of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD. I do not really know if there is more but there is this feeling that there is just because its hard to open up about pain, trauma, or even when a doctor asks questions like have you been feeling down or anxious. I have no idea how to answer that other than not much more than normal.Is there any way I can get a gauge on my feelings or being able to more accurately describe my feelings for a realistic picture on my mental health. Not knowing about my mental health sucks, especially when its hard to pen up to the people you are supposed to.",0
"Idk where else to post this, but this is something I have been thinking about a bit. And I do not mean this post in a gate keeping or judging way. I deep down always kind of suspect that suicide attempts where people take a big amount of a pill but do not take anything to prevent throwing up are more of a cry for help thing just like cutting yourself superficial, so there will not be any scars but some blood and crust to show. People see someone on tv or wherever doing it and recognize that these kind of actions/tropes communicateIm desperate/I need help and then replicate them to communicate this message to their environment. I think this kind of blurs the line between really suicidal people/people who harm themselves as symptoms of an mental illness and the ones who are just asking for help. Suicide as an ask for help",1
"My life has been rather difficult for the past 2-3 months now. I try to have joy when I can but as soon as I stop doing whatever, or it does not go well enough or I cannot stop thinking about negative stuff, my day gets ruined. Again and again.. I thought I was over it... I kind of was.. Last year life was great honestly.. But it was all escapism.. All I did was nutrition study, language study, food making, exercise and sleep.. But then of course, I got so many constant comments about my appearance how I was ugly, that I looked like a guy and pointed and laughed at I just stopped going outside, stop making varied delicious foods, though still did the others for a bit.. But even that is gone this year.. Whenever I try to become stronger, better version of myself, more resilient, kind, fun.... I get met with so much constant push back it is getting exhausting.. and nobody understands.. I do not share much with my friends these days because it is just the same and so exhausting, especially to be remembered myself about all of the negatives, when I just am trying to be in the now and do what little I can to improve on myself..At this point however, I am getting worried I guess.. I already attempted before.. One serious attempt, and multiple smaller one which at most just gave me some temporary pain but had 1% chance of killing me really.... Why I am worried is that I actually feel it.. The temptation, thoughts, feelings about suicide becoming as strong as back when I had my serious attempt, and I do not know how long I can go on without trying again.. Sadly there is no help for me.. I need money to fix myself... At least some minor surgeries to fix my flaws so I can look average at least and not harassed fearing leaving the door every time, move out to a safe place instead of where I currently am which is also unsafe, have money for more than basic needs unless I save up for 6+ months at a time to splurge a bit on more fun stuff like clothes I need or maybe a new game and such.. Just living on food, meds, basic life necessities gets exhausting.I thankfully started seeing a psychologist last week so at least I got that finally after asking for years, but it is like once a month kind of thing atm because it is a free offer and I cannot afford to pay for one myself.. I also am seeing if I am stronger than before to see if I can hold a job or study again, since last I tried it went extremely bad and I broke down completely.. And that is with streaming.. It has a pressure like a job (for me), but it has been difficult.. though while it is extremely difficult to me, it has also brought the most joy to me in a long while... I feel so conflicted. Especially since I am also here, feeling the pressure and just not being able to handle it as much anymore.. It was the last thing I felt I could try. See if I could actually accomplish anything, yet... I feel my friends and some followers just pitied me or were curious for a bit, and now what.. I am too broken to become anything ever.. So why bother going on.. Especially since my entire life except for last year (only year in my life where I actually felt happy) has been overall terrible, hard, sad and filled with escapism.. If I did not have streamer subs and a friend coming over soon I dunno, I feel I might have been gone already by now, or tried to be.. Sigh... Thank you for reading.. Feeling like an ugly failure and that I am no good at life..",1

"I feel trapped in my own life. I have a labyrinth of activities that use to pull me out or at least distract me from of my depression, but they are proving ineffective.

"Tw: SA, over dramatic life storytelling PSA, it does get better. but not if your brains chemically imbalanced.the suicidal thoughts started in grade six, i remember because in class i drew this picture, a picture of a girl (me) that just blew her brains out with a pistol. my teacher saw it on my desk &amp; i was reported etc they called my mom i had to go to the counseller twice or whatever. funniest part is my drawing was caption goodbye cruel world i was 11 or whatever, what did i even know about how cruel the world is.going into grade 11, same 5 words pass my lips everyday. I am going to kill myself. its almost comforting. when I am breaking down i repeat it to myself, it usually goes like this. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself &amp; it will all be okay, it will all be better.it brings a sense of relief.i have never actually tried to kill myself, yeah I have sat down &amp; started swallowing some pills but I have stopped myself, who uses pills anyway, the success rate is not in my favour. its been 5, going on 6 years since I have had a day without being suicidal. i am 16. this is not the way it should be. i forget there is literally people that do not have suicide cross their mind at every inconvenience, maybe that just makes me over dramatic.worst part is i put myself in all the situations I have had to overcome. grade 8- guy(grade 11) asked me to come hug him at lunch, he did more than hug me. in his defence i did flirt with him, i did send him things. at that point i had not even had my first kiss, of course everything i said to him was bs, i just wish i made it clearer. i spent the rest of that day in the bathroom scrubbing my skin, followed by a silent bus ride &amp; the longest shower when i got home.grade 9- i know some people say your boyfriend cannot r4pe you. but he did. i said no so many times i lost count. when i asked him if he heard me he said yeah but i was just too horny aight. he would not let me leave him, he harassed me &amp; said my death would be on him if i left. i sound insane for staying but you really do not know what those words feel like till you are in that situation. i feel jacked for missing him, i miss him, one of the most traumatic experiences of my life &amp; i want it back. atleast i knew someone loved me enough to threaten to kill me if i leaved them. grade 10- started online schooling permanently. i cannot deal with seeing my ex. the year my attraction to guys my age completely vanished. not going to mention any details of my current bf, just know I am not getting better, i am not healing, i am damaged &amp; leeched onto the first boy, man* that showed me any attention. he is not hurting me to make that clear i just know this is wrong &amp; its just damaging me further. the relationship technically is not illegal. but its not something he would want people to know, because yes, it would make people lose respect for him. i do not know what is wrong with me, I have never been to a therapist or anything. but i do not think its normal, i cannot have more than two consecuative good days. if i do you best know the third day ends with me &amp; a bottle of pills having a stare down.i am afraid, i am afraid because when i was sitting there with a bottle of pills i used to think about how my best friend would feel, used to make me bawl my eyes at the thought of leaving her alone. that thought does not make me cry anymore. i am afraid of having a worse day than normal &amp; it ending with me lynching myself. because nothing is keeping me here, i do not feel guilty about leaving anymore. one more push &amp; its over .on top of everything i do not get my period anymore, hardly anyways. breaks my heart, but i guess its for the best. i would be a terrible mom. it does not get better",0

"Hi All, I have battled depression for a long time(as an adult) and as a child was diagnosed with ADHD and have been on every kind of medicine to help me focus you can possibly think of. I was in denial about my depression for a long time but one day sought help and finally started medication and seeing a psychiatrist for it in 2015. I have been on Wellbutrin every since and frankly that alone saved my life. I also take Concerta as needed during the work week to help me focus and have been on that forever. Over the years I have experienced depression slumps where it was like the Wellbutrin was not working as well and was experiencing more frequent anxiety attacks and was put on lexapro with wellbutrin. I was on that combo for about 2 years and noticed i lost all interest in everything I used to love before. It was nice to not feel anxious but it was not nice to not feel anything else. Back to just wellbutrin and also back to experiencing panic attacks and daily spiraling thoughts and questions that I could not answer about why and how could I still be depressed? I workout, eat healthy, have a loving family, have friends, love my job, graduated college and yet still feel as if I have an anchor pulling me down physically, emotionally and mentally. After many talks with my doctor I am now on Prozac and Wellbutrin and had found a great balance and felt almost normal for a long time up until recently.

I think she is kind of ignoring the situation and she believes everything will go back to normal soon.she is planning the move to Hawaii while I am planning for my own death.I am still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my body and mind will get erased from reality for ever, and it is fucking with my mind really hard.I would have loved to spend a few more years with this amazing girl, I had plans to travel the world and do amazing things with her, but I guess the universe had other plans for me.I am very concerned for my girlfriend's wellbeing. I have a feeling she will go completely insane once I am gone.it is going to be very hard on her, as we have been together 24/7 for quite some time now. we are inseparable.I want to make this transition as easy as possible for her. What should I do? I am getting euthanized soon, I am scared my girlfriend will kill herself once I am gone.",1
"Sup guys so I have had a funky time with mental health. After having a very fun depressive few months.. years on and off I really and I mean really want to get rid of this clingy stubborn crap stain of a companion.I have tried doing that by trying to enjoy life more. And you know I am really fucking happy to admit that I think I am almost there. But its like I am sitting on the edge of a cliff and when I look down I can see the type of person I want to be but becoming that person feels like I am going to have to jump off and here is why. I want to be able to wear clothes that look nice and make me feel nice when wearing them. I want to have a better relationship with my parents and sibling. I want to focus on my hobbies like art and writing. Start cooking and doing it more often instead of just eating cup noodles. I want to start enjoying train rides to cities looking at the Opera house at sunset, meeting new people, having lots of plants, doing things that make me feel at peace. man, I just really want to start enjoying life.But every time I do things that I have always wanted to do I remember why I did not do it before and what stopped me. Every time I wear clothes I am excited to wear I keep thinking how bad they look on me. I remember looking through my clothes and putting together outfits I might be able to wear if lockdown gets any better but after every outfit deep down I did not like how my body looked on all of them. I have gained weight and it feels even worse when my mum comments on how fat I look. I am 57 kilos and 163 cm which might be chubby but personally would not go on to say I am fat yeah know? however to my mum, it is beyond every time I come to have a conversation with her, she comments on my weight, my hair, my looks. I remember she used to comment a lot on my grades but after I got A's and made it into a competitive school she stopped and went on other things, the constant shame of grades had driven me into trying so damn hard at school thinking maybe if I get better grades my mum will get off my back. But its as if the more I try to make her proud the more ways she finds to get disappointed. But she is my mum, she is toxic sometimes but I know that she cares and certain times she shows it. but it is hard. it is hard having conversations with my family. There so.... strict and hard to talk to. So judgemental. So overdramatic. Whenever I talk to them I get reminded why I did not. My mum always says I am just avoiding my family I say that I am busy but the truth is I just want to have a nice time with them but I am scared. I am scared that they will say something mean and either ill have to pretend it does not bother me just to maintain, peace or ill let it get to me and get emotional. Whenever I do art, write poems do things that I like I regret doing it because I simply do not have time. I barely have time. School takes up most of my time, it is like I have no free time. Every time I do have free time I study. Study, study, study. Even though I am well aware it will not mean anything to my parents. it is like second nature. I cannot stop thinking about school. I go tutoring in the city, so aesthetic train rides to the city? Yeah reminds me of all the hours I spend on Saturday doing math. it is just that. When I start getting better, all I can see are my flaws. I am emotional, a workaholic, stressed all the damn time, insecure. I get so disappointed, Soon enough before I know it. All the motivation I have to get better disappears. And I am back to square one. I think one of the first steps to getting better is understanding I am very flawed but what after? And how do i get past this? I want to get better for myself, for my mum to stop worrying about me, so i stop getting annoyed at my little brother, being a bother to my friends. I really want to stop hating life because to be honest I have got so many good things i want to look forward too, so many good people i love. Yet deep down i *always* get worse, *i always get dissapointed, i always get fucking tired of life all over again* I want this time to last. How do i look at my flaws and not hate myself and get depressed all over again? How can I look at my flaws and still be... ok?",0
"I suck at everything. I cannot talk to people, my old friends do not really like being around me anymore and I cannot make new friends. I have no skills that are beneficial or will make me money. I have never had a girlfriend or even been kissed and it seems like girls like me less the more they talk to me. I have blown every opportunity for a successful future.I just feel like I am not even the same species as my coworkers or friends. Am I even human?",0
They say it gets better. It doesn'tShit man I do not know what kind of pussy human feeling stopped me from climbing the rope. I regret not going through it when I was younger and had more enthusiasm to do such thing. Now I am suffering away till the day I will say goodbye.Fk I regret not committing suicide,0
24/7 all i can think about is hanging myself. Time moves by and i am always back to square one. fuck this shit. I might really do it this time. cannot get the thoughts out of my head.,1
I held my loaded gun in my hands today. I cannot help but think that things are better if I am not around. I am just tired. Tired of being the problem. Tired of not being enough. Just another day,0
"I have nothing left. I do not want to be here anymore, I want to be free, I want to go. I received no help from my psychiatrist nor from my doctor when I told them about my depression because I am 16 in the middle of a global pandemic so they think I am just sad like everyone else. I am tired of receiving no help whatsoever. I needed it but now, it is too late. I just want to die already. I have had anxiety for my whole life and was diagnosed with it 3 years ago. But now, the consequences are too important. I just want some rest god dammit. My parents do not care, they do not want to help me and my friends are mean to me for no reason.",0
"Work is still depressing, I still feel so overwhelmed and left behind with a lot of things, but I do know one thing that I always seem to forget when I get deep in my thoughts: I have awesome people who are still by my side. One coworker is depressed with me so we vented on the tailgate of his truck during break while he smoked a cigar. The other coworker and I are fine. Hes inviting more people to our outings and I told him that I am ok with it and if we could still go together some days. Hes my go-to for a lot of things and I feel like I have been losing him for the past month so I am making damn sure I am keeping the only thing that I look forward to from time to time. I love spending time with him and shooting the shit. I know our favorite thing cannot be just our, but when other people get in the picture, it will be harder to truly vent and get things off your chest. The people he invited are cool but again, I have been through a lot of shit this past month that my friend would understand. I hope him and I will go next weekend because its long overdue, but the group thing can be whenever. Anyway, I am not completely depressed, just trying to hang on to something. I know everything will be ok. I love my coworkers. I know I did not lose my buddy. Its just been crazy lately. Need to forget things",0
"My mom lost her battle with Covid 3 days ago, she was in the hospital for almost a month, slowly fading away, until finally her lungs could not oxygenate blood anymore.The thing is, she was always sick, she had Lupus which is a chronic disease that affects your joints, brain, and kidneys, and I have never seen her healthy in my entire life, and she also had depression.And 1 day before she died, I told my therapist that I hated her, because she brought me to this life and I blamed her for my misery, my point was (why did she gave birth to me when she suffered from such a chronic illness?) and I could never appreciate life, and for that I cannot forgive her.The next day my brother called me and told me that she died.And now it is been 3 days and I hate myself sooo freakin much for having these thoughts just before she died, I feel like I am the worst person ever, and I do not deserve to be alive.In her dying breath she told my brother to take care of me, even though we are both adults, and when I learned about that it made me feel even worse.Like ok I know she was not the perfect mom, but there are none to begin with, I just wish that I could talk with her, kiss and hug her one last time.It hurts so fuckin much, my last memory of her should not be me blaming her for my situations. I feel like I am going to vomit just thinking about this.P. S I live in a different country and I could not travel to her due to Covid restrictions. My mom died 3 days ago to covid",0
"I have always felt I was a ugly guy, or at least when I was 10 or 11 I started thinking about looks and hating mine. I am recently being told in therapy that my self image needs real work. I thought most people hated the way they look. Turns out everyone dosent like something is about themselves true but hating every thing about you enough to get angry and upset at pictures and reflections is not normal. So I tried the mirror bullshit of saying you are attractive myself but I couldng get it out. I was like Jim Carey in Liar Liar where he cannot say something hes knows is not true. I have been trying posting and allowing pictures of myself and even when I get compliments I cannot believe them. I will probably delete the one I put up not long ago. I thought I could handle putting up the pic but now I feel ugly and stupid and like it got to go. Trying to not feel ugly, and failing miserably.",0

"Grew up in an abusive household, constantly yelled, belittled, gaslit, hit, bullied all my life. I cannot remember the last time my eyes were not watery. I finally got out of an extremely abusive friendship with a narcissist, but i think he was a sociopath. I have been going through the motions, letting out all these feeling that i never acted on and ignored. And seeing things for the 1st time for what they really were. Since then, I have broken my bathroom window, almost cutting my knuckle off. A week later, i started hyperventilating to where i could not brreath. That was an interesting feeling. And then i went into a blind irrational stasis of sorts, idk what to call it and juat cut 13 lines in my arm. Kind of like a blind rage but not. I try to hide it but sometimes it gets seen and everyone just gives a judgy glare. I later went into a blind rage having flashbacks and broke the window in my car. Why do ppl always assume cutting is just attention seeking??? Or breaking your car window with one hit of an elbow (what kind of weak ass glass breaks on one hit)",0

"I meant that. Stop preventing me from doing this just so I can live in pain humiliation and torture. This week it ends. If not, hell on earth will continue to get even worse for me. And ok its all my fault then why not let me fix it for good. Me dying is a good thing not bad ok? Please. Something literally just healed me last night you felt like i had a heartattack. I am not going to allow that to keep happening. I refuse to stay here and i quit this body. If someone like me wants to die please do not stop me. You do not know what type of hell they are going through. do not assume.",1
"I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since is was 8 years old. To be honest its all because of my abusive parents. A few hours ago they were cursing my name, hitting/punching me and spitting at me. They say that I am the reason of their misery and that they hate their lifes because of me. I am a 15 year old girl who tries her best in achieving everything they ask me to do. I hate my life because of my parents. Nothing is ever good enough and I think a lot about ending my life. I told my friend about my thoughts but she did not care. I wish somebody understood me and helped me through this without judging me. The worst thing is that I am always smiling and hiding my pain. I want to make people laugh and smile, that is my only source of happiness. I wish someone could make me happy and genuinely smile without thinking about suicide. I hope I will attend that day. My only wish is to be free, happy and never have to remember this pain. Suicidal thoughts on a daily base",1
"They say suicide is selfish but if i decide why cannot i have the option to die peacefully after a certain age? is not it selfish for everyone to prefer me suffering everyday rather than being peacefully dead? Like if i decide to die, do not make me search for weird non guaranteed ways that can leave me seriously crippled, give me some amount of mandatory therapy and if a still want to after that, let me go.. I genuinely do not get why i need to live, i do not want help i want to die",1
"I have been depressed since I was 12, and I am 20 now. I have a lot of issues in my life and even though I am on antidepressants, some symptoms just do not go away. Sometimes I just cry about how long I have left to live. I do not understand how I am going to survive through 60-some more years of absolute hell on this place we call earth. I have suicidal thoughts but I would never attempt it, so all I can do is cry about how long I have left to live. Does anyone else feel this way? Cry about how long I have left to live",0
"Feeling like it is going to be that time again, when I sit and think about why I have let myself go on this long. I turn 24 soon. Never got an education, never been employed. Living with someone who sexually harasses me daily. Drinking alcohol every night to feel more than this empty apathy. Unmedicated for this constant mental anguish that makes me want to punch myself until I am black and blue because at least bruises do not leave scars like the ones on my wrists that remind me I did not have the guts to go the whole way. why did I let it get so bad? Why did not I do something years ago? Why am I still bothering to wake up everyday? I am too much of a coward to get it over with, wish I would just get something terminal and rot away until there is nothing left. Hopeless Again",1
"Hi! My mom has had depression for the last 15 years where most days she mostly just sleeps and does not want to do much. Sometimes its off and on not always like this but some weeks it is. she is been on medication for years as well. (she is in her late 50s btw)She was recently told by her psychiatrist that ECT may be beneficial but it seems like its quite controversial. Anyone have any experience with it?Seems like there may be alternatives like TMS. I am just kind of scared because it says memory loss and obviously because of her long term depression I would say she does not have the best memory to begin with like forgetfulness and things like that. I obviously all I want is for her to be happy, but I just want to make sure this is safe my mom is planning on getting ECT",0
this sounds terribly absurd. yet i cry everynight because of it. I have never paid much attention to my ethnicity until i started noticing that when people referred to asians they only meant the east asians. i feel disgusting and it leads to the point where i hurt myself because of it. i scream to the point where i cannot talk anymore and i just feel so worthless because of this. i feel as though i am a waste of life. i do not know what to do. i wish i was east asian. not southeast.,0
"As an introvert and a person suffering from depression, I really thought that this whole pandemic can help me rest and have a better mental health since I decided to go home to our province. I was really expecting to have a good environment, finally a rest from the busy and noisy city life. But I was wrong. First few months was great, it was fine. But as it gets longer I am starting to get this bad feelings again. I was actually starting to have panic attacks because my childhood trauma was like reopened (I do not know what is the better term but it was like having a flashback of all the bad things that happened to me when I was a child)And then I feel pressured because I do not have a job since I resigned before I went back home. Though I started this small business but it does not seem to work out. My parents are starting to complain about the bills and I really really wanted to help them financially but I just cannot. I cannot even find a part time job online because of this pandemic. Now my friend suggests that I apply to work abroad, she said I might be hired once the pandemic ends but when is that going to happen? And oh, I remembered that I cannot have a job abroad because I have this illness. I have this weak lungs. Who wants to hire a person who has weak lungs?!?! That sucks right? Now what I am supposed to do?I cannot even bother my family telling them all this, about how I really feel because I do not want them to worry about me. I am used to not telling them about anything anyways because they will just dismiss how I feel anyway. So yea. that is why I chose to just share this here. On this app.But you know what. I am really tired. I did not asked to be born like this. I do not want this. I did not SIGNED UP FOR THIS. I am tired being tired. I am tired being weak. I am tired being depressed. I am tired crying every night. I am tired being me. I just do not know anymore.",0
"Hi all. My ex of almost 4 years told me that, before I called things off, she attempted to end it. But she did not tell me this while we were together. I just found out a few days ago when we chatted for the first time in months. I do not know how to feel. Ex was suicidal when we were together",1
"After three years of medication for my clinical depression, and anxiety i stopped last week. My life had been quite traumatic previously to this, lost a father, had crazy family problems and was not having the best high school experience. After 6 years in total (three before the meds), I am so proud of myself. 5 attempted suicides and the trips to the mental health hospital ward at least three times a year (I am a guy btw). I am finally happy. My family love me so much, even if it does not feel like it. For anyone out there feeling lonely, you always have someone to fall back on, does not have to be family but someone will always be there i promise xps. if you are being recommended to start taking some anti-depressants, i can promise you the reward is a lot better than the risk. Lots of love, Stay Safe I am finally happy",0
"I have had anxiety and depression since I was a kid. My mom left me with my grandmother months after I was born and moved away. My father left the picture before I was born. I always felt so alone and always felt like it was my fault. Like I was not loved or wanted and just there. I am an adult now, married to the man I love more than anything but have always acted as if everything is ok. Always acting strong when deep down I feel so tired and weak and hide it as much as I can. I have broken down in front of my husband once but when I did, I felt so vulnerable it made me feel so much worse about myself. Feeling like he deserves better than me and constantly over think why is he with me. They say you need to love yourself first before you can lover others, but how can you do that when you get pushed down no matter how hard you try to get back up. I was bullied a lot as a kid, taken advantage of, and has made me feel even more and more worthless. I tried to end it all by taking pills once but it did not work and thought maybe it meant I had a second chance at life and things would get better. As I became a teenager, I continued to be bullied. Had no friends, struggling in school since I felt like I did not fit in and made feel stupid even from teachers. Got to high school and it just got worse. I moved away to a new school, new faces, and depression grew more. I made some so called friends that never wanted to hear about how I felt. They were all so positive yet I was the negative one since I just never felt like I fit in anywhere. As an adult, I have no friends at all. Everyone i know is married with kids and always asked when I will have kids. I do not feel like having kids is an options. I am scared of the thought of bringing a child to a world and have them go through the same thing I did. My job gives me so much anxiety on a daily basis. I work with all men who look at me like I do not belong there. Constantly being put down, talked down to like I do not know anything or good enough for the job. I put a fake smile, act positive, but on my breaks, I break down and trying to put myself back together to do it over and over again. Day after day and its come to the point where I just feel so numb from life that I sometimes struggle with how to keep on going. Everyone sees me as a bubbly person but that is all I can show since if I show my true self, no one wants hear it. Sorry for rambling on, I just feel so lost and do not know how to deal with it, keeping it all inside just hurts that is much more and feel like ending it all would just let people I love down, and doing that hurts just as much especially getting guided that I am an adult and need to act like it. I hate this so much! I am tired of acting strong",0

"Deep down I feel like my mom sees a part of herself or someone she knows inside of me and she hates it. My mom knew how bad. I stressed and why I would have breakdowns and she wonders why I was how I was when I was younger. She found my suicide journal when I was a freshman I think it was and I lied that it was not mine. I remember she said I knew you could not have wrote this but little does she know I have always been suicidal. The first suicidal thought I had was when I was 4 I remember I fantasized about death and that lasted for a few years then things got bad and I would pray to god to help me and kill me even. I love my mom with everything I have but I know she is damaged too and its not her fault that she is the way she is, I do not blame her. If I was in her shoes I would have gave up on myself.

I was almost three years clean from opioid addiction. I have a good job. Good family and everything was going well. My girlfriend left me unexpectedly after over a year together.

I cannot tell if I have lost something or if I never had it. I have been called heartless and rude, but I do not react anymore its like its become a part of my character I have grown devoid of it.

it is not my fault. Quit saying that it is all my fault and talking down to me. Quit blaming people with mental issues for thier problems.

"So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself, because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe- different dress, behaving certain ways, etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself, my personality, values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like, the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more ""pushed our"" into the world, environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am. The etymology of depression means ""to push/press down""",0
After being turned away by betterhelp (it was about two weeks after everything shut down last year and I was in a pretty bad place) I found Open Path. Now every time I hear an ad for BH I roll my eyes and wonder how they are still around.They are a for-profit organization who make over $200M/year. **Open path is a non-profit who charges you a one time fee to be a lifelong member**I Venmo my therapist and the money goes directly in her pocket. I am glad I stuck it out and continued to look for help because being rejected access to an online therapy platform nearly threw me over the edge.I apologize if this breaks the rules in some way but I had to tell you guys just in case one person benefits from this. Love you guys and hope you are having a good day today. Just feel like this has to be said,0

I have my doctors appointment in 10 days and I want to ask for ECT but I was just wondering how long it takes to do it. Do you think I will have to wait months for it? How long for ECT,1
"I am not sure what I am trying to say, or ask, in this post. it is not 'to' anyone, or this sub in particular but i cannot think of anywhere more appropriate. i think I am just taking stock of where i am at, because I am scared of where I have been before, and I am scared of where i might be going again. I am fucking terrified.i beat this years ago and i thought i had come away from that place for good. i really really did.and I have been trying to pretend I am doing well but for at least a year now, maybe two, i think I have been slipping back. grinning on the outside and hoping that if i lie to myself long enough it would pass. but things in my life are falling apart.i have had issues for years and years feeling that nobody listens to me. like, yeah people hear the words i say, and they respond with words too. but that is where it ends. nothing i say has any bearing. i could go to a restaraunt and stand in line and when i order, the chef would say ""okay, take a seat at a table"" and then not write my order, not cook my meal, and completely ignore me when i try to ask what is going on. as far as my input having any effect on things - i may as well just have kept my mouth shut since birth.I am sharing a house with someone. for a couple of months now. i feel like I am being attacked for the pettiest things but at the same time they are doing these exact same things to a much larger scale. i did a massive amount of rubbish removal and also some yardwork on the weekend (the yard has been neglected for months amd months before i moved in) and maybe i was being selfish but i was hoping for at least a thankyou. all they did afterwards was use me as a wall to complain to about their other problems. not a single mention of the work i had done. i only moved in here because its not possible to live with my partner right now and it was really hard to even find this place, now its looking like ill have to move somewhere else because i feel like I am walking on eggshells and just waiting for what the next problem will be. its wearing down my mental health every single day.but i cannot just move out now either because my job ends in just under 2 weeks (the business is folding) and we employees were only just told about it. so i will not be able to afford to move anywhere now anyway. it was hard enough to get this dead-end job as it is and now this is being taken away from me as well. hello homeless here i come.everything is just piling up on everything else. any time i have a win its as if life has to point out that it was tiny and meaningless, then it goes and takes something away from me just to make sure i am completely defeated. I am sick of feeling like such a fucking worthless piece of less-than-nothing. i feel in my mind that i was supposed to be left in a dumpster at birth and because i was not, life is just bullying me until i finally neck myself and fix the universe. i tell myself this in my head and i can feel my heart agreeing. if my 3+ decades being alive so far are anything to go by, then yes, life will only get worse. pick any point, any point in time and things only get worse from there.when i talk with the kids about growing up, and how exciting life is, i feel like such a fucking liar because that is not what life has been for me at all. life has been 30+ years of finding reasons not to hang myself fucking dead. i just want to cry. I am sorry for anyone who read this. time to be honest. I am fantasising about ending my life again.",1

"Hello everyone. I have watched a few youtube videos about depression, and according to them I am not depressed. I know that is right, because i actually get up in the morning, i have never had a suicidal tought, i can do my everyday life without particular problems, i do not have phisical symptoms and i only took like 2 kgs in one year. I have to make it clear that i do not feel depressed.So i have maybe 2 symptoms out of 10 and i know that is not depression. But still i feel sad all around my day, not the crying sadness, but more like a constant background sadness. I hang with friends and i feel good, but when i leave or they have to go i remain alone with my sad toughts. The reasons about that sadness are various, some missed opportunities, nostalgia about various things, a sentimental problem i had ecc...Like i said, nothing too overwhelming, but it is enough to not live a satisfaying life. I do not need to seek psichological help because i can get my mind in order, and i have not any kind of problem living my life. I know that for depressed people it is much worse and I am sorry for them. But for me that i have never been depressed that is the lowest point in my life. I find myself drinking everynight not to get blackout drunk, but just the right quantity of alcohol to numb this painful feeling of void and loneliness that otherwise i cannot shake off.My hope is that time and various situations that soon will drastically change can help me getting a fresh start.it is 1 am i should go to sleep.Goodnight everyone and sorry for any grammar error english is not my first language. Not really depressed, but still...",0
"So basically I am feeling really shitty and abandoned and alone. My previous account where I had made lots of friends was permanently banned. Because someone described depressed people as their Hollow brethren so I made A Darksouls reference about how being a Hollow from Darksouls would suck, because even if you killed yourself you would just get reserect at a bonfire. Then a few days later my account is banned saying I threatened violence. it is super confusing because it dosent threaten violence I just said being a hollow would suck because you would reserect everytime you tried. I do not understand, do they think I was telling the o.p they should kill themselves? I appealed and it they said it still violates the threatening violence rule. So now I feel like a piece of shit. I lost all my friends and karma and got shut out of the one place I went for support.

"I am 32, I have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, after having suffered a lifetime of suicidal thoughts. I spent years in psychiatric care but was wrongly diagnosed and never got the help I needed. I was bullied and abused as a kid, I was extremely bright and sensitive and high hopes and a huge appetite for life. After I burned out it completely went away. Even if I could have it all I still would not be able to enjoy it because my brain is destroyed from trauma. Severe memory problems, emotional dysregulation that shifts sometimes several times a second. Chronic insomnia. Its never ending. I am incapable of doing mundane everyday tasks that can pass timeMy life has been constructed to isolate me in the most profound way and I lost the ability to occupy myself with areas of interest because of chronic anxietyI started having breakdowns where I scream in despair and wake up neighbours who calm the police.Its happened so many times I know the staff who arrive and today we even cut things short because they know there is nothing that can be doneI cannot cope with the disappointment of what my life has become. I used to be a singerI have not sung in ten years and my fits of rage have destroyed my vocal chords. I cannot even hum to myself without triggering anxiety severe ADHD ( medication does not work, it usually ends in anhedonia and uncontrollable rage attacks, ASD, burnout syndrome, seasonal depression, tinnitus, ptsd, narcissistic personality disorder, hiv positive, I was wrongly diagnosed with borderline and I have been denied the social care and therapy for years because I am labelled as a hopeless caseIve never been able to work, I did not finish school. I used to have too grades and I have rare artistic talents and a deep understanding of art and science but I have never been able to build a context where I belong. I am alone all the time, I often cannot even listen to music because of the sensory overload.I am so scared of dying but I have no realistic reasons to think this will ever change and I can tell I have gone far in the process of pushing myself to the edge and finally kill myself.I never have energy to do anything, I feel like I spent the last 20 years waiting for a bus that never arrives. These days when I call my parents I end up screaming intelligibly outof sheer desperation and I dissociate. I cannot even externalise curiosity of the world because how the system destroyed me and how the planet is dying.I am chronically depressed in a way where I am incapable of falling in love and meeting someone. I lost so many friends and opportunities. I would not even have been able to fantasise life would become so painful. The envy makes me physically nauseous and hyperventilate. This is the end for me.I wanted to live but this life is never going to be good enough. What I need to sustain balance always overwhelms me and leaves me in deep fatigue. Goodbye This is my story",1
"I do not know if this is because of depression, but I just cannot get myself to do things until the last minute because there seems to be a force in me, like a heavy rock or something weighing me down and making me freeze and preventing me from being productive. I still feel motivation but it is more hypothetical motivation than real motivation. it is not anxiety--i'ts some sort of procrastination but not even so because instead of doing other activities I will stare at the wall or stare at my project but not really do it. I struggle to meet deadlines even though I have time. I feel like I have no energy to get something done but at the last minute, a weird wave of energy can kick in as if I have no other option and sometimes it is fine, other times there are negative consequences. it is a weird sort of procrastination but it is that I literally cannot get myself to do anything I should be doing. I keep putting things off. it is starting to really mess up my life and I do not konw what to do about it, People tell me to jsut force myself to do what I need to do but I literally feel as if I cannot. This applies to almost every aspect of my life, and I do not understand why. Inability to get things down and meet deadlines",0
"Every so often on an askreddit thread I see a post about what men want more of and every time one of the top replies is compliments. I have never been able to relate, I do not say that to be arrogant, just to provide context and hopefully some people reading this may stop judging themselves and others based on appearances. Often through my life I have been told I should model, or complimented on my looks, which is rare as a man, but this has never translated into healthy relationships due to anxiety. I grew up with acne until I was in my early 20s and bullying left me with debilitating social anxiety. When I drank it went away but that is never a good strategy.At 25 I finally faced down a few of my demons and with the aid of liquid courage for the first time pulled a one night stand whilst travelling, when it came down to it I could not get hard. I had to jerk myself off to the point of almost finishing so when I did enter I lasted two strokes. After this I dated but felt too nervous about sex to follow up on promising dates, I remember one date with a girl that seemed a very good match, I cancelled on her hours before we were meant to meet twice because of anxiety.A couple years later I started going out and managed to pull a few more one night stands, each time the same routine, I would be hard and ready to go, then have anxiety at the point of penetration and lose my erection. Girls were put off by this and even those who had been chasing me down for second and third dates stopped messaging. This made me feel like an abject failure, I looked around at everyone around me, all able to do this fundamentally human thing, and felt isolated for not being able to follow through with the one thing that is the reason any of us are here in the first place.Since then I have gone through the cycle a few times: avoiding dating altogether -&gt; downloading the apps and sorting myself out with dates -&gt; taking a girl back to mine and going limp at the point of penetration -&gt; avoiding dating altogether -&gt; and on and on.At this point its not just the sexual inexperience but the inexperience with relationships that only further entrenches my feelings of being an outsider who will never fit in. I am now 30, my friends are marrying or having children, and I am unable to do anything more than smooth talk a girl into bed (and then fail to penetrate her).This is a deep source of shame for me, noone would guess this about me, I feel like a fraud. Some friends have told me they assume I am a fuckboy, it would be interesting to see their reactions if they found out how wrong they were but I am too deeply ashamed to share this w anyone.If I play this out to the future I am not sure what happens. When I was younger I had hope in figuring it all out, but that hope is quickly fading. I have tried cialis, I have entertained loading up on a high dose and visiting prostitutes until I am desensitised to sexual anxiety, but sometimes I feel fated to stay stuck where I am, and that makes for a very bleak outlook. If you read this far thanks, aware I am ranting now. Erectile dysfunction and alienation is ending me",1
"on the surface, i do not have any reason for suicidal thoughts, and maybe people would think I am ungrateful but really, what is all this struggle about? i mean i have friends that support me. i have a family which is financially not good but always has my back. shit, I am only 20 years old. my grades are not very good but I am in a college which is quite good among the other colleges in my country. but why am i having these difficulties for a future? i do not want to give birth, i do not want a family, I am not ambitious about my career, i do not have any kind of passion for life, i do not have anything to look forward to. so why? why should i keep feeling these burdens when i can just end it? if i knew my family would not be devastated, i would just end my life in the blink of an eye. with no hesitation what are all these struggles about?",1
"I am a drug abuser (benzos and meth mostly) and have been diagnosed with schizophrenia 11 years ago. My psychosis is getting worse although my drug use is ceasing. I dissociate heavily and I barely even feel like I am a real person typing this. The voices and visual hallucinations are constant, but worst at night when I am alone and not doing anything. My best friend barely talks to me anymore and its killing me to think that I care more about her than she does about me. Worth mentioning I am kind of in love with her. She was the best at calming me down in severe episodes of psychosis and was always so patient and caring and gentle. And now that I do not have her in my life anymore, its tempting me to use drugs to cope with the depression which I know will make the schizophrenia worse so its a lose/lose. Every night now I lay in bed and listen to the voices telling me awful things about myself, usually in the voices of people I know, worst of all, in the voice of my dad who passed away 4 years ago that I never grieved over because I was so out of it on drugs. I feel so alone and I get so scared at night because I have been known to dissociate and black out and harm myself, coming inches from killing myself, literally (I had a gun pointed at my temple and the trigger was being slightly pulled, came to just before the bang). I constantly struggle with the decision of whether I want to live the rest of my life trying to deal with this horrible disorder, or if I want to just say game over and call it quits.

"I have (19F) been, making it for the past two and a half years when my life began to spiral down. it is been a living hell having to hide so much and live like a worthless, poor excuse of a human to my family, friends, and even boyfriend. I do not deserve the stuff I get and when I do, I feel bad. Let me explain, my parents have loved me and my Mom tries her best to make me feel as though I am not a burden on the family. My Dad showers me in goods and does his best to spend time with me. My brothers on the other hand love to remind me how useless I am and even one for their wives reminds me of my uselessness. At least my middle brother's wife is sweet and says she is proud of me for going to college and getting a life out there. But one of my brother's wife, brothers, and sometimes even my Dad reminds me of my uselessness. I cannot explain the feeling of dread everyday and the fact that I am such a nervous wreck, I cannot keep my first job or learn how to drive. I have been sitting at home, wasting away, doing chores, helping out, and feel like a leech for not being able to be independent like I hoped I would be by now. I feel as though I have let not only my family and loved ones down, but mostly myself. I have endured a lot as a kid. Loads of endless, non-stop bullying in my younger years when I was 7, creepers being creepy, adults enabling the torment I ended up receiving as a child, adults arguing, sickness, loss, loneliness, abandonment, and the list goes on.I want to be happy and see the light at the end of the dark tunnel, but I cannot seem to escape the cold hard reality that life just gets worse and everyone will be gone eventually. I consider myself the stick in the wheel, the rock in the gears, or even the knot in a string. I hold everyone back.it is making me think things before that I have been for years now and I cannot seem to get rid of the thought of having the sweet release of death. To rid me of the pain that is life, me.I know I should not be thinking these things but it is been so difficult and I am so disappointed in myself, I cannot help but think for ways to escape.

What I cannot live with is longterm, physical health problems that cannot be cured or permanently alter your daily life. You know you are fucked when doctors shrug their shoulders, when therapists run out of advice, when your family becomes uncomfortable and changes the subject. I am currently plagued by chronic pain and other conditions that are proving difficult to diagnose. At this point, it is no longer a war in your head - your life has objectively gone downhill. I am not a martyr, I am not a ""fighter"", I am beaten down and worn. I had very little to begin with, and now my body is declining, too.

"For most people, it seems like life is just mostly tiring, stressful and what applies to all of us is how pointless it is. Even before I was depressed there really was not all that much worth living for. And I was born into a middle class family with a great upbringing. I could not imagine how terrible it must be for those less fortunate than myself, which is the majority of the population.I feel like those who are happier and focus on the positives have to delude themselves into this mindset and pretend that all of the shit going on in their lives does not exist. Its kind of like nostalgia. When you are an adult, you reminisce on your childhood and remember how great and awesome school was. But that certainly was not what we were thinking at the time. Most of us hated school because it was boring, monotonous and forced us into behaving a certain way.And they say that your school days are the best days of your life... that is just terrifying. I am 19 and have not done anything since I left school. When I was 11 I knew this would happen. I cannot take care of myself or interact with people properly, so I knew Id be screwed once I was left to take on the world myself. My non-existent motivation, self-esteem and social skills are making the future look bleak for me. I do not want to become a wage slave in a depraved society that makes you wear a fake smile and pressures you into being like everyone else. And I cannot even be myself if I wanted to because I do not have a personality. Like is this really it? Working and working and more working until I die now? I hate this world, I hate humans and how greedy and destructive we are. I do not want to contribute in this. I want to leave. Do the moments of happiness really make life worth living?",0
"Hey. Thanks for reading. I am 22M from Europe and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, OCD and anxiety last year. I have also spent some time in a psychiatric ward and was doing SSRIs and benzodiazapenes. The because of my depression was a series of traumatic embarrassments and mistakes which I mostly caused myself. I was never really a good decision maker, even though I have read a ton of self-improvement books and whatnot. I had a real hard time remembering the things I have learned from them and often act out of emotion/impulse. To make everything even worse, I was rejected by a girl I was infatuated by because I was behaving very cringey and she found out embarrassing stuff about me. I have left myself too open and vulnerable to people that did not deserve it in any sense. And it hurts.I am a high school drop out because my biggest passion was to pursue a music career (rap). However, I was also thinking finishing my last year in school and go to college. Mostly because I want a plan B if I will not be able to make money from rap, but I also think it would help my depression. The depression itself is the actual thing that keeps me from doing the stuff I love, keeping me stuck in the past, feeling intense anxiety because I am now afraid what people think of me, and I never had that problem until now. Is it possible to reach happiness again so I can become the athletic, quick-witted, confident happy guy I was before things went south in my life? I also want to dedicate more time to the gym &amp; writing lyrics, but I just lack the motivation to do so. Can I pull myself from this dark &amp; scary rock bottom I am at and fulfill my dreams? I hate wasting my life but at the same time cannot just shut off my depression. Peace. 22 years old and depressed. Can I regain my confidence &amp; happiness and become successful in life?",0

Lately i have been experiencing alot of looming thoughts of just disappearing and somehow stop this pain....i have tried almost everything from self love to self care and nothing seems to be working... I am feeling so much pain in side,1
Just walking next to a Lake with people kayaking.I would love to do it and I remember the time my 7 year older friend (I was 14 though) and I went kayaking and it was loads of fun. But since then I have not found and Single Person who wants to these kinds of things with me.Makes me feel sad to watch. I walk around and everything just reminds me of not being able to do any of the activities because I have no one I feel comfortable with and who feels comfortable with me,1
"but things are really beginning to fall apart. My job, my family, my accumulation of useless shit from over the years I cannot enjoy a thing anymore. My therapist sucks and my psychiatrist sucks. I really cannot do this anymore...I know I have said this before....",0
"I left home yesterday with the intention of not coming back. After hours of driving around and mentally going to hell and back, I did come home. In the past when this type of thing happened, there was a relief of survival and even a little hope. This time feels very different, I now feel like I was not supposed to come back home and now I am living on borrowed time. Anyone else have experience with this? Borrowed Time",1
"it is been years I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, Ocd and what not but everytime I have some big fight with my parents i feel its the breaking point and I am surely going to attempt to kill myself again. They have issue with everything I do, how I behave, how I look. I try my best but in their eyes I am nothing but a disappointment and failure which should not have existed in the first place. Yes they have said it to my face especially my mom. She is dealing with her own health issues because of which she tends to breakdown as well but there is a limit to talking shit about your kid. I never mentioned any of my relationships to my mother but she was very open about it so I mentioned about the girl I like now and she straight up demotivated me to the ground by saying I am not good enough for her, I am unattractive and what not, and honestly at this point if someone hands me a cyanide pill I would happily take it and end it once for all. I already hate myself and her talking shit to me just makes it worse more and more because I loved her the most in the entire world. Just because I am not capable of showing or expressing it does not mean I take her for granted. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up or OD on some sleeping pills and painkillers I hate myself and everyone around me",1
"I am just so fucking tired, my head is pounding and my feet are still shaking, it is so fucking hot working inside that tiny food-truck, I should have worked at burger king or something, just as intense but at least you get breaks, some time to relax and eat and actually get water to drink!and more pay too!I used to be really into the idea of suicide but at-least now I have some sort of hope of just continuing with hobbies and what not, but fuck me, I can barely bear this shit right now, it is just perfect timing too ya know, just when I am losing my fucking mind I have to work this intense ass job having to deal with costumers all day and everything around me getting fucked, cannot go an hour without something going wrong.And I always get scolded and criticized on every minor detail just how it was like growing up, it is so fucking exhausting.I want to bash my skull into something, I feels like my head is in a vice and I just need to BREATHE!!There is barely any air in that place and I have to wear a thick mask all day for corona and shit.I wish I could function like a normal person like my coworkers, but there is so much on my mind and I feel so much pressure on myself to do a perfect job, I just cannot bear it.&amp;#x200B;Rant over I guess.. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;No wait!

"i wish life was different. maybe it is and hopefully it will be. but right now. my life is no where fucking CLOSE to what i want. man I am so damn tired of the same ass shit. my life is just lame and boring and I am literally 19. i hate the way society is. i hate how people treat me. i hate waking up and working knowing one day i will be dead. i hate missing good times. and i hate feeling invisible. empty. i hate everything until i smoke a joint lol. sounds cliche, but honestly since my grandpa passed i started to feel numb as fuck and worthless. i cannot seem to manage my life correctly and its just getting worse. i have no goals. besides hopefully make steady income and be happy. i doubt a single soul will give a fuck to read this either. will just be another useless paragraph that i type because i feel lost. oh fucking well. i need to find a balance or something. idk what i need. but hopefully i fall so god damn mf hard on my head soon that it knocks some fucking sense into me lol. goodnight. 3am. fml",0
"Hello my lovelies, Hopefully you are browsing here because you are intrigued as to why this subreddit exists, or you needed help once and do not anymore- maybe even want to reach out to someone, or just all the reasons we.all wish we never felt the need to be here. But I hope that you are OK.I am not.I am nothing, I am useless and I need better ways to complete suicide.I am 32, I have tried multiple methods over the years, and frankly overdosing on painkillers has been the most effective but it is slow and has allowed people time to intercept. I need to go now. I am sick of being a burden, I am sick of never being enough and I just want to stop bringing everyone down.I have tried cutting, but honestly I chicken out, I find it too hard to apply enough force. Painkillers mixed with alcohol works great, but too slow. Please help me to figure a way out so that I can go without dragging it out My hope has dissipated again",1
"I suffer from an incurable and poorly treated condition. People underestimate it then abandon me when they realize how bad it gets. Is it me? Is it something I did wrong? They tell me it is just too depressing to see someone get that sick so often with no way of easing it. That they did not know it was *that* bad. I am currently with someone that did the same thing in the beginning of the relationship. Underestimate it when after previous experiences I made sure I was extremely clear. He led me to believe he would protect me. Once again I ask him if it is something I am doing and he just said I should have known he was stupid when I made it clear in the beginning. That it was my fault for believing him. he is only interested in me now when he has a boner and I am severely depressed about it, which makes me cold and he complains he does not get laid enough. Vicious cycle. But I am currently in the middle of a bad flare from my condition and can barely walk. I cannot go anywhere. I have to stay here and even if I did make it out, I would end up in a homeless shelter. So I lay here now in the dark everyday terrified of my next attack, about to run out of pto and will need to go on disability (and that is a gamble tbh), and the only person in my life that was committed to helping me is now terrified of my condition yet will still try to be present only if he has a boner. And if I move out I will not really have that much of a better life anyways. Fuck man. Fuck. I cannot even believe this is my life. I cannot believe how many shitty people exist in this world. Everyone is a mix of stupid and crazy and I have to rely on them to survive. I am so fucked. I am headed towards a mental breakdown.",1
"Just do not really have the energy tonight to write my note , film the video , dress nicely and send personalized goodbyes to my friends .Like I have got the whole shabang written down , step by step , even picked out a bridge , just need to find the motivation , time and resources to check things off the list up until the grand finale.

does anyone take this? i recently got it prescribed to me and i want to know any side effects it may have and how it makes people feel. its used as an anti-depressant for me but is also to help people stop smoking? Wellbutrin?,0
"I cannot cope with life and do not know what to do. I have no friends. My family trigger my ptsd because they remind me of the past. I just have no hope. I am so tired of waking up everyday. I have tried absolutely everything to get better, therapy and medication for years, exercise, yoga, meditiation, distracting myself with work. These things help a little, but overall my brain is just fucked. 2 friends of mine ended their life over the past 2 years and I keep thinking that they had the right idea. I think everyone knows its only a matter of time before I end it, and I feel like I should just hurry up so everyone cannot grieve my pathetic life briefly then get over it and live nice peaceful lives. I think I need to end my life soon",1
"Hi, I am 21 starting my junior year in college and I am currently on vacation. Well while at the pool by myself just enjoying the wonderful Florida sun, these rich kids I guess they were about my age, came up beside me and started calling me names like a stupid F**got, a fat ass, I do not remember the rest. Why are people so cruel to each other? I have worked for months to she would the weight which I was at, and I am genuinely proud of that. But when people say that I want to just jump off a bridge. I used to be obese, now I am just overweight and I am proud of that. I have lost nearly 40 pounds. Then they talk about how I was dressed and it was just a lot. I got up and came back to my condo where I am now just bawling my eyes out. Like I am not gay, but if it was is that an insult like I am so confused. I did not ask to be here so why do people consistently make it worse. I do not know those guys and what they go through, but are not it some shit that they can be born affluent, talk about people, get whatever they want in life and still live a happy life. I do not get it!!! Fuck this world, I do not want to be in it. I hate existing",1

"I am sad and I am scaredGuys idk where else to turn to with my feelings right now. I am just so frustrated. I have been in my antidepressants for 6 weeks now and I am not doing okay this past week. Idk if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. what started this all was me kicking my sister out of my house for disrespect and overstepping boundaries, then basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated 2 days to try and help her get ready.. while I was at her house getting her ready some drama happened and My sister (the one I kicked out) was trying to fight my mom, so I just stepped between them and then my dad comes between me and my sister and yells at me like I was the one instigating. He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so ofc I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour. Then my cat has to have his leg amputated and its going to cost us $1000 or more after everything is said and done with his er visit, preop exam, and surgery My sleep schedule has been messed up and it gets worse everyday. I sleep till 4 in the afternoon and I am ashamed of myself. I feel disgusted by myself honestly. I start school august 18 and part of me feels like I cannot make it bc of the way I am dealing with stress rn. I am over whelmed and now I am discouraged and that makes me feel ever worse. I hope someone can understand what I mean. Its almost like I am sad BECAUSE I am sad in a way. I am in therapy but I did not get to make it to my appointment yesterday because of my sleep schedule and also staying home with my cat. I have no friends and I feel like I annoy everyone so that puts me into antisocial mode. I just want it all to stop. I was doing so good the first 4 weeks of my meds and slowly it got worse and I feel I am right where I was before and I am scared that I am ganna have to be depressed forever bc medication is not working . I am sorry if this sounds dramatic but its literally how I feel. I just feel hopeless, my antidepressants have not seemed to be working this past week AT ALL.. I just wish I had a friend who has been through this to kind of help me bc I am lost.",1
"Is being rude the new thing?Are there only 2 choices, to be rude or to be someone with whom everyone behaves rudely?And why cannot I make the choice to be rude?

Its a high of happiness and then an insane sadness and depression in an instant. Does anyone else deal with this. It makes my life unlivable the people around me do not know. I do not feel like explaining. I have been called dramatic before but I legitimately attempt suicide every time. I do not tell anyone and I am miserable being alive.

I really want to feel loved and want to have someone interested in me. God I am so fucking lonely. I have been suicidal for a couple years now and I really want to do it now.

I have had about 14 beers (are still going) writing this, probably the only reason for my honesty.I am living back in my father's house (explains the dryspell) having failed as a trucker and (most recently and twice over) an Amazon employee, my manager at Amazon killed my transfer to the trucking dept without a word to me and while I was ""SUPPOSED* to be covered by their ""blue vest"" rookie rules (which are bullshit as are their ""sign on bonuses"") and the job that I left for (JB Hunt) died on the vine too. there is a woman who I ""was"" involved with years ago that I still have STRONG feelings for, but I have no idea how to voice any of it. Would probably be worse if she in any way felt the same.I have been having suicidal thoughts and impulses for longer than I would admit, thinking of more than a few ways of getting it done. Pills, a nose, driving of a bridge, I have put too much thought into it.I am seeing myself as beyond any help at this point, I am mainly wiring any of this just to get it out.Probably too much text for even Reddit at this point, damn sure Twitter or probably facebook.

"I understand the trauma for the people on the train.But nothing disgusts me more than people insulting those who chose this way of ending their lives.They do not care that they killed themselves. They just want them to do it where nobody looks. In solitude and in silence. With shame, almost. Or surely.Nobody cares whether you stay alive or not. Nobody cares if you are going to kill yourself or not. They only care about the impact it will have on other people.If your death will not hurt anyone, if no one will mourn you; if you do it nice and clean, without disturbing anyone... No one cares.Such violent, traumatising ways of taking one's life would not be a thing if one had access to assisted suicide, or any other way to get a painless and quick death - at least, as painless and quick as it can be.Yet society appears not to be ready to give us this possibility. So for now we will just keep on jumping onto tracks, making a mess and traumatising people.Ainsi soit-il. Suicide by train",1

"I am 23 male from Iran. I have had a crazy life like mom diying in car accident when I was 4. Abusive psycho dad. Being raised by my narcissist strict grandparents. I have had no life. None. No rights no hobby no freetime no social interaction. Was just forced to study 24/7 to become a doctor. My grandparents would not even let me to groom my hair properly or wear perfumes because that would attract girls! I had never met or talked to a girl for my intire life till I was in university and that obviously turned out terrible. I have so many personality issues and find it hard to properly socialize with anyone. I got into med school in another city expecting to finally start living a normal life and having my basic rights. All those promises my family had made that they would finally let me be free or the things they are going to get me if I get into med school but suddenly my rich narc family stopped paying for my basic needs like even enough to buy proper food! Or to pay for my taxi! Let alone hanging out with friends or getting a girlfriend. They said money will spoil you! You will get busy with girls and not finish your studies!! I wanted to take my driving license and they replied the same :) I tolerated that hellish situation for 4 months but after that quit. It was not that easy they still argue/fight with me to this day. 2 years have gone by and I am stuck in my room with nothing much to do but making the days pass 24/7 on my phone or watching movies. I soon realized being a garbage collector/construction worker in a free country free of Islam and theocracy is better than being a doctor or even specialist in this hellhole of Iran. I realized through the online friends I made that I am not the problem. The Islamic system is. I could easily connect with people and even girls not only romantically but on a human level and make true connection but here the restrictions and rules have made our girls kind of weird and too hard to catch. Like until 2 or 3 years ago being caught just walking with your girlfriend on the street would have ended up with 100 lashes and execution in the 4th trial. Iran is like a big cemetary. we are not allowed to sing/dance or date. it is like happiness is forbidden. walking on the streets is like there is dust of death everywhere. So depressing and things are getting even worse like drought!! And our currency devaluing day by day. Right now the value of one USD equals 25 Toman. My dad is a selfish piece of shit that lives in another country but I do not count him as dad and do not want to have to do anything with him. My grandma finally gave me 10k for a language course abroad in Europe but I need atleast 15k for my whole application and visa process. Idk what to do with 10k. My alternative plan is to make it to Turkey, get a cheap boat and sail to Greece with the hope of getting sunked midway. I hate my life",1
or maybe tomorrow morning. i cannot stand it. everything is too loud. i cannot stay here any longer. this body is not mine anymore. I am done. i feel like tonights the night,1
i do not know why i even had hope that it would get better. Things only get worse and i hate when ppl say it will get better. My mind is telling me to give up everyday I am trying to fight but i do not think i was made for this world. I love my parents and they are very caring but i do not think that is enough reason for me to keep going. I have nothing going for me and i hate myself. I remember when i was a kid and was actually happy with myself but those days are long gone. Now all i can think about is how worthless i am and how i do not belong. I think this might be my last few days here. I hope everyone has a good day and keeps fighting. it does not get better,1
"But I have to, my life requires it, I do not have the luxury of relaxation because I did not save money in my 20s (drugs/alcohol). Here I am at 31, I wake up in on an air mattress in my dads workshop, which I am thankful for because Id be sleeping in my car if my dad did not grant me this one respite. I leave by 6:30 AM before the neighboring businesses employees show up and realize I have slept there. I usually get right to work, driving Doordash till exhaustion. I have had to pay $1,500 in car repairs the past month and it needs another $1,000 which I do not have right now. I am so burned out, I hate living like this, even though I was car-less for 2 years and it was misery and I am about to sell the car. All I have ever wanted is a place to live, a computer I can play League on, and a cat, and a girlfriend if any girl ever was willing to date me but I will not push the envelope. Today, I did not have the mental strength to Doordash. I asked my parents if I could relax in the spare bedroom if their 2 million dollar beach house but I am the black sheep of the family, the only one without the key to the front door (brother and sister have one). So they said no, get out, I am not allowed to be in their house if they are not there. So I waited outside for 4 hours while my mother got lunch with her rich friends. And now I am laying down, and in an hour my dad will leave his workshop and I can go lay on my air mattress. And for the 5 hours between then and sleep, everything is ok, until I wake up again. Some days I just cannot get out of bed",0

We were worthless to him and that is how I still feel. When it is finally over you are met with bodies in the hallway. The fear he gave me never left. Everything I feel is from HIM. it is like he will always be a part of me and I want him gone from my headTo the outside world you see thougths and prayers, flowers and stories how it made them stronger. It was a fucking massacre. You cannot therapy that experience away. When I go to sleep I know it will be there when I wake up. I do not want his decision to do what he did stay with me. Holy fuck it is so bad Survived a school shooting but it is stealing my life",1

"been pretty much depressed ever since i was 13.. 10 years later n still feeling the same suicidal thoughts. I have never really had friends because we would move houses every year/2 years so I would have to go to whatever nearest school was at our new location, bc of that I have never spoken to anyone and been mute my whole life even now idk how to talk to my own parents/family. but few days ago really topped it off for me with my pet dying right in front of me. it was so scary and traumatising I have never cried this much since my bf cheated on me. the loss of my cat just.. they were the only one i felt comfortable with like i would not of been bothered if it was a person passing away but someone so close to me? just triggered the lowest I have ever been. how do you stop the suicidal thoughts? i feel like my parents never really appreciated me as much as they say they do because I have had to leave every job I have gotten because i cannot deal with the social part of it all to the point I would get panic attacks n start crying/breaking down of them negatively judging me etc. honestly the thought of killing myself has been daily I will tell you that now but it is the pain of it all that is stopping me and the fact i still have debts to pay which i do not want to pass them onto my parents or grandma. i just feel like if i knew how to talk to people/keep a conversation going i would not be so anti-social and suicidal all the time like I am trying my hardest to make friends so i do not feel lonely but it is so hard when i have nothing good going for me. when does it get better?",1

"it is not the same anymore. I am painfully lonely. like, listening to falling asleep with you ASMR videos while i cuddle my pillow, lonely. i pretty much stopped talking to everyone because i felt like they hated me. even when i talk to the one person in my life, she is just so cold and all i feel is sadness. i do not enjoy people, and i do not enjoy talking to them, either. I am anxious and stressed out around them. talking about my feelings does not help anymore. it leaves me feeling regretful and wishing that i would have just shut the fuck up and been more of a man about it. i feel like talking to people used to ease the pain.",0

Everyone keeps ignoring me when I try to tell them that I am falling apart. No one is listening",1
"I have been having a very difficult 8 months, in all the ways possible and had been contemplating taking my life for basically the entire time. it is not something I have really talked to many people about, and had been working to see a therapist as soon as possible, but have been having issues thanks to insurance. I kept telling myself ""if I feel this way in 3 months, then I will look into my options to end the pain."" And 3 months came and went, and I still felt that way. 6 months passed and I would find myself laying in my bed with tears in my eyes, watching the latest news of how humanity is destroying itself and wishing I was not alive. 8 months went by in a depressive fog and I continued trying to give myself hope for a future, with very little luck. It has felt like despite trying to do everything right, nothing has gone right or even slightly in my favor. This morning I felt the urge to end my life stronger than I have felt in my adult life. In a puddle of tears, contemplating how to take my life I asked myself ""what am I even living for anymore?"" And my phone rang. My phone ID showed the caller was my beloved sister who I have not talked to in months. I could not bring myself to tell her my mental struggles, but hearing her voice saved me. And without knowing what I was going through, she delivered the words I needed to hear most. She gave me hope again when I felt it was all but lost. From one sad heart to another, *PLEASE* do not give up hope. The people who love you would miss you more than could be put into words. (I know this bc I have survived many suicides in my life and each one hurt in ways I still have not been able to fully process.) It may feel rough today, tomorrow, and possibly for years to come. But it does get better. Just remind yourself that you *can* do hard things, even if the hard thing is an internal battle with yourself. But if you give up that fight you do not end the pain, you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved you.My only advice is do not struggle alone, it makes everything so much harder. Call someone, anyone you know that cares, call a crisis hotline, write an anonymous post, go do something you love, try something new, but especially treat yourself with kindness. You are not required to be happy every second of every day of your life. You are human, and the human experience is a messy one. So, be messy, love. do not lose hope.",1

"I know that if I fuck up a suicide attempt, the rest of my life is fucked. I have already almost tried multiple times. For example I wanted to get a fork and stick it into the power outlet, or cut my arm open, etc. But with a suicide attempt, there is always the chence of fucking up. And I cannot even do simple tasks like sweeping up. I cannot even properly hold silverware while eating (I give my autism the fault). So how should I be able to commit suicide?The saddest thing about this is that I am only 15, so I have barely seen any shit in life. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the fear of failing",1
"They both think I am pathetic. they are not wrong, but its be nice if they at least tried to hide it. I struggle to brush my teeth and bathe regularly so even the small tasks they have me do seem like a mountain of effort. When I show even the slightest amount of exasperation they either berate me for my irritability or say (in the most condescending tone they can muster): I am sorry to put you out. Am I asking too much of you?. I just want lie down and do nothing but that would never fly with them around. How do you all handle living with people who have more sympathy for a dog in the street than for their own child? My parents treat me like I am some sort of pestilence in their life.",0
"""what is the point of anything? I might as well just end it already"" is a common thought I have. I guess after all that stress, my mind just gave up and I have stopped caring about anything. I have become so apathetic to life. Everything feels completely meaningless.",1
I might as well not exist to some people and I know its probably my fault somehow but its just so tiring. Having people build your hopes up only to knock them down and the fact I wake up in the morning at all; let alone get ready and do things with myself is a fucking miracle.I really hate my body and everything inside it I wish I could shapeshift into someone loveable being inside it feels like a prison and I cannot describe it. I am sorry I hate being perceived only to be ignored,1
"Hi I am 32 M, dropped out soon after starting my undergrad. Now I have a job and all but I am lacking happiness... I enjoy the challenge and and everything but as my work ends everyday I realize I have nothing... I am living with my parents but we hardly talk and Everytime I do initiate, I am responded with tales of how I messed up my life did not pursue a degree cannot get a high paid job and all... 4 years back I started dating a friend and I guess today we broke up... The reason, she thinks I am sexually attracted to every girl on my friendlist on Facebook. Now everyone is different and everyone have their own personalities and comforts... Some of my friends do not hesitate to publish pictures that make them look and feel sensual... My take on that is everyone has their freedom to do anything and everything as long as it does not because harm to the community and or to another living being I am not bothered with it. But my gf thinks there is more going on... To help ease her with her feelings till date she asked and I have blocked 8 friends on spot for no apparent reason just to ease her... I have isolated myself with long-term friends because she suspected me to have an affair with their younger sisters... I have always had an helpful nature but over the last 4 years I have not helped a single female which led to my coworkers questioning my sexuality... Even at office she asked me pics of my sitting arrangement and upon seeing it asked me to move my desk as their wad a girl next to mine... It would have been awkward for me to change my desk at that point instead I had to change her team and reporting boss so that she sat next to him... But now after doing all that today we broke up because another friend of mine commented on my status on fb who seemed to have an attractive dp which again led her to believe I am involved with her physically... Even after sharing all my passwords and IDs, my banking information and everything she still thinks I am spending money on other women which I clearly do not...So yeah from not a high paid job, no education and now no partner, nothing's doing me any good... Maybe I am crying out for some sympathy here but I am not lying when I say I am lost... I was a cheerful person who was passionate about dancing (though I was never good at it) but now I have got no passion for nothing...Oh I had to lose my passion for dance because my ex and I used to dance together and yes back then I was involved with her physically and would often participate in making love but when she lost her affection towards me (plus started cheating on me) I was understanding enough and have no ill feelings for her... because the heart wants what the heart wants I only wished she had spoken to me before cheating but that was her decision to make... So my current gf ever since then asked me not to watch dance videos/shows anything that adds fuel to my passion... Side note I did not have sex with my current gf but I did tell her that I am very much attracted to her and would like to do it. She asked me to not ask this of her before marriage and I do respect that. In the last 4 years I have probably asked her for it only thrice.... Except for the first time the other two both ended with very bad arguments and name callings from her end... The most we have done is kiss and that is all.... I am sorry if all this seems pathetic but it is how it is and I cannot help it neither can I stand it anymore.... If anyone reads the entire thing, THANKYOU it meant a lot.... Desperate for hope",0
"I once had this psychology professor who was lecturing on depression and how it has biologically evolved from the beginning of our ancestry. She made a statement that still has not left me, which was Some people are meant to die. As hard as it may be to come to terms with, not everyone is meant to live long, fulfilling lives. I am an example of this; as long as I can remember I never belonged anywhere. I do not remember a time where I was not thinking about wanting to kill myself. I feel like my whole life has just been this never-ending cycle of loneliness and disappointment..no matter what I have achieved. I try so hard to be the best person I can be for others and for myself, even though dying is always raging at the back of my mindI fuck everything up. I ruin things. I am not good enough because I just was not meant to be. I have tried to kill myself three times and even managed to fuck that up. It would be better for everyone else if I was no longer around. The verbal abuse I receive at home and at work is never ending, consistently reminding me of how much I do not belong. My friends love me, but the stakes are low for them, always at arms length and never going out of their way really to maintain communication in person, and never keeping plans. I am so tired. Tired of existing on this planet that was never meant for me. My future only consists of misery and loneliness. The future that will not exist because I know when I try for the fourth time, I will not fuck it up. i was meant to die",1

Sometimes they just feel threatening and I get anxious if we fight in the kitchen around knives. Is this me or is it them?

"Depression has ruined my future. I am just now realizing it will be almost impossible for me to go to a good grad school because I have so many Ws on my transcript. I had a depressive episode my spring semester of college. I ended up getting 3 Ws(do not worry, I have more than just 3) on my transcript that semester. I moved states thinking all I needed was a fresh scenery and so I enrolled in community college. At first it was going well. Then I got depressed again and dropped one of the two classes I was in. I stupidly signed up for 4 classes the next semester and ended up getting Ws for all of those classes as well. I have 8 Ws in total. When I was in high school, I made straight As and dreamed of going to a prestigious college. Due to suicidal depression, I did not put as much effort in college applications my senior year. I thought Id be able to redeem myself for grad school but not only do I go to a low ranked state school but I have tons of Ws. You may be thinking college prestige is a hoax but I want to one day be a professor. In academia, the prestige of your college matters a ton. I have to say goodbye to that dream all because I have depression. Even though I am just now getting back on track academically(made straight As in community college). I got rejected from my dream school and now have to say goodbye to my dreams. I am 21. It does not get better. I just want to die so bad. I cut myself really bad a week ago and still have an open wound. I wanted so bad to pierce it through my stomach and slowly bleed out. I do not care about the pain when it comes to Suicide anymore. I deserve it and I hate myself. I cannot do this anymore. I want to kill myself so bad. I hate being alive",1

It does not matter how right you are or how talented you are , all that matters is whether you conform. You cannot be different and constantly submitting to people bugs me off.

"A friend had her wisdom teeth taken out last november. 3 surgically removed (like shattered and removed type shit because of how sideways they were). They gave her 12 of the 5-325 mg pills for the pain the following days. She only took one. She has constant pains in her back (big boobs) and migraines and stuff and the ""pain"" was just more of a soreness so she did not feel the need to take any more. She told herself to ""be a man and deal with it. Suck it up"" so now she has 11 norcos just laying around. If someone were to grab the bottle and just down them all suddenly... would it be fatal? Would it make a difference if their blood pressure is naturally low as well? Just curious shower thoughts. Curious thought about hydrocodone/ acetaminophen",1
"People do not care about me because I am here. And I always will be. But our friends who have taken their lives are loved and remembered and celebrated and cherished. When I say I am going crazy or spiraling or my depression is worse than usual I am ignored. When I post a sexy pic or make a funny joke I am complimented. When I mention wanting to die, there is a short burst of attention to make sure its not serious, followed by crickets once I confirm that I am not imminently going to kill myself.If I died, Id be remembered for how smart and funny I was. I actually really like myself most of the time, and I imagine that people would laugh about the silly stupid movies I loved to watch or how I always listened to Taylor Swift instead of new music and how I gave really good hugs. they would probably think it was my insecurities about my body, my ongoing mental health struggles and recent turbulence after graduating and not finding a job. But it was the friendship, or lack thereof. I miss my friends and I fear the only way they will care about me as much as I care about them is when I die. None of them would even read this if I posted it on Facebook or Instagram or even texted it to them I bet, but if I looked them in the eyes and said it, they would deny it. Unfortunately I think I am not that bad and I do not totally want to die, so I might just have to find new friends which sounds so hard I might just kill myself anyway I want to be loved and celebrated like dead people are",1
"Last night I was going to try to overdose and only took 5 sleeping pills. I was playing Minecraft and just crying a bunch and eventually told of my friends and she said she was going to call the police. I only took 5 so it definitely would not have killed me (at least I think) but anyway she said she would not call the police as long as I made myself throw them up, I did. I went to bed after that and sometime in the middle of the night I woke up. I was super super super dizzy and tired but could not sleep and my arms also felt really weird, I kept having to move them which was usually me punching the air. At one point I decided I was going to watch YouTube and I could not even remember typing things in while I was doing it, it was really weird. But yeah this is like my 11th unsuccessful attempt and I honestly think I am done trying because it sucks. got to love unsuccessful attempts",1
"that is normal. Not. I have always hated myself and my life so much ever since i was a kid. Suicidal thoughts ever since i was a kid. It just gets worse the more i age. I am quite broken. My mind tormented and plagued by past trauma and existential crises. it is so appealing to escape the suffering of life and the suffering of my mind. I was planning to travel to some places i really wanted to see before i die. Like the pyramids and the great wall of china. But now I am wondering, why bother. I feel a bit like a coward in not wanting to go through with a painful suicide method like hanging. I just want to leave this world peacefully. I am not sure which method yet. Some kind of gas probably, that is always been one of the main ones i have been interested in. But there is still quite a bit of preparation you need to do for this method like obtaining the gas and then setting up the method. Whether an exit bag or something. Exit bag sounded good, but looking at people in them it seems a bit morbid now. Like your last moments of vision will be in a bag. I am not sure. I am researching about suicide methods on my birthday",1
"So its been a good 3-4 months since I have been really depressed and thought about killing my self everyday (with failed attempts here and there as well) but every other day I get these suicidal thoughts. yesterday I had a knife in my hand and thought about cutting my self for a split second (since I have self harmed almost everyday 3-4 months ago). A couple of days ago I have also felt the feeling of the void which I am pretty sure many of you are aware of (feeling of emptiness), are these signs of relapse? Not depressed anymore but still feel suicidal",1

I am slowly but surely getting to my limit and I do not know how much more I can take before I blow. I am going no where in life. No plan for 18, no passions to chase, no colleges in mind. All I know is that, no matter what, I have to get out of this fucking house. I do not know anymore. i do not like where i am in life and i cannot see myself ever getting out",1

"Hello. My name is Trout (not really). I am new to this sub and reddit as a whole, so please forgive me if i make any mistakes. I am sorry if this is long, but I just need to say something. For the past few years I have been depressed, the whole of 2020 just blends into a few months in my memory. For a while now I have been self-harming, and I think about suicide often. I feel so small and dumb and ugly and just generally unappealing. Almost like I cannot try to be or act cute, because I am just butt ugly. I cannot do anything. I thought I was an introvert and just preferred sitting in my room alone on my laptop but that is the only thing I can bring myself to do. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. When I do not, I just feel empty. I feel fine when I am with friends, but always just so lifeless when they are gone, and whatever they say about me has the power to sway my mood so heavily. Even when I am with them I feel lonely. Unloved, unaccounted for. Nothing brings me proper joy anymore.I just want to give up. I just want to stop trying. All I want is to fall asleep and never wake up. I am so tired all the time. Whenever I think about dying, I feel a sense of relief, like I will finally find peace. feel like a selfish asshole for thinking this way. I have a good life, and I just want to throw it away? I have read so many stories on this sub of people that have it worse than me. It feels awful. I keep telling myself that these feelings will pass one day, but they never do. I am scared that I am blowing it out of proportion, though. What if it is just no big deal? I am such a baby. I cannot even tell anyone because they will treat me like a sensitive topic. I will immediately be the problem child.The only things keeping me from going are my family, especially my sister, and my dear little cat. Whenever I am away he cries out at night, looking for me. he is sleeping right next to me on my bed as I type this. I have made it a rule in my mind that when he goes, I go. Otherwise it would break me.If you read through this, thank you for your time, I appreciate it. nothing is changing",1

I usually am a very cheerful Person, and pretty optimistic.But it always seems like my life is crumbling away. My Mother has cancer, I fucked up my relationship with my grandparents, and I am / was in a relationship with a girl that has now (after 1 year of being together) just ghosted me.I have a job, and a future that seems quite promising. I am beginning a college grade education with the German police force, so I actually have nothing to cry about. But somehow, everytime I am alone, I feel like none of that matters.I have developed an alcohol Problem which causes me to hurt people I really love.

And I just cannot Handle them anymore.I just want to be that cheerful motivated guy again, and not the constantly drunk depressed Idiot sitting on his balcony in the middle of the night complaining about his life.But These Episodes just will not fucking stop. It feels like I have a fucking anvil tied to my feet while trying to swim.

People will tell me that everyone makes mistakes and no one should push themselves so hard!, and yet people will get pissed off at me, yell at me, and hurt (physically and/or verbally) me, telling me how much it says about me and not them and how much I deserve the punishment for my mistakes. Its just so fucking ironic lol.Even the littlest mistakes I have made are just so big for me. I am feeling like all mistakes are the same, and that my mistakes will be just as bad as others mistakes.As much as I love everyone on this earth (this includes my family, friends, and even everyone in general), I do not love myself as much.

Everyone that I know and consider friends mostly just feel sorry for me or just pity me. Being alone and knowing that I will die alone is just exhausting. Even though I am only nineteen I just had enough from what I have seen in this life. I have come to accept that there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel waiting for me. I have always been alone and I will always be too. Its sad but that is just how life is for some people. Maybe in another life I will have something or a meaning of existing. Having no meaning or worth in this world.",1

"Yea, well. Here it is. I look at my life up until this point and really dwell on how many things I have been keeping to myself in mystical awe as to how I even manage to do it without driving myself crazy.I feel weird laying in bed tonight. it is 3 AM and I have work at 7 AM. Promised my girlfriend I would work out with her at 4 PM. I hope that still works out considering it is a promise, and I have not worked out in years and am just now mustering up the courage. I want to preface that this post at times may feel it is losing its direction. Sorry about that, I am writing what comes to my head. As I was saying, I feel weird laying here tonight. My mind has a lot of thoughts going through it. Mainly the sense of confusion as to what is wrong with me. Right now I feel like there is a long line in front of me (figuratively). Each thing in line is a different emotion. I am the receptionist at the front of the line, and on most days I would deal with each emotion one at a time. These emotions do not ever seem to have a regular pattern. They can be constantly changing from feelings of sadness to intense anger (internalized), happiness (not too frequent with this one), anxiousness, melancholy, and (what I see the most) a dissatisfying meh that says everything feels fine today, I am still moving along to the extent I can and not thinking about my true inner troubles.BUT tonight, I am not dealing with the line. I am just letting it build up and having the front customer ring the bell over and over for my attention. I am looking at this line with a feeling of confusion and unfamiliarity as if I never dealt with it before. I have all of the emotions stacked up and I cannot seem to be able to process them. I feel everything but nothing at the same time, it is white overwhelming but not at the same time. It sucks it took that long to explain how I feel currently, and the silly part is that I do not feel satisfied from that explanation alone. I notice that for a while I have been unable to trust MY ability, the inky real primary source of myself, to tell someone how I am feeling. Because I am never sure myself. I am never familiar with how I am day today or will be tomorrow. Maybe I am just overthinking all of this or maybe I am not. How am I able to tell someone how I am feeling if I cannot understand or validate my initial thoughts. I know I will probably wake up tomorrow and look at this and brush it off as a bunch of rubbisH, then push it to the back of my head for it all to come back again. FYI I am writing this completely sober. Where will I find my zen? I know that sounds cheesy, but for real, when and how will I find my inner self-understanding. I look at like with different mindsets, and they switch up every day or week without my notice. I just recently got a screen for depression, and for one I did not answer some of the questions honestly because I was too nervous too. But also these questions were driving me crazy, I could not tell how to answer any of them. If I answered them a second time the day after, I would have given different answers. That day I walked out of the doctor's office feeling self-critical and angry about this. I wonder if my mindsets change too much. Maybe my personality is too malleable? I understand that people change, but my view of how I view myself and the environment around me changes a bit drastically sometimes.I obsess over dumb shit. Waist too much time revisiting and spending extended periods of time pondering on them. Lately, I have been very concerned by the possible idea that I may be bipolar or something. I feel so stupid for even typing that out, but that is the truth as to how I have been thinking. I probably am not, and I just overthink everything. But it roots from my desperate want to understand my emotions. Recently, I had a day (i do not remember why) where I felt very very very low and sad. I have not had this feeling in a long time. I physically felt slow. I mentally felt unable to comprehend the external environment. I felt too lost in my head. The world around me shut off, but I was still going on autopilot. I was so sad, I felt numb. This was a build-up to this low from the past couple of days before. I was having some really dark thoughts I do not want to talk about. But the next day I felt so up, to the point I had a euphoric feeling in my body for part of it. Now I feel like I am starting to level out again. That day admittedly, I had a really fun day doing activities, so maybe it was that. But what throws me off is how I went from SO SO LOw (like you have to take my work for it) to SO SO. high.I could go on more and more, but my fingers would fall off from the typing, and I am starting to get tired. I hope this post stays up. I guess all I am asking for is someone to listen. Even if you do not respond to this, thank you for taking the time to hear my rambling. I am sorry if this feels like a shit post, I do not expect everyone reading this to understand or relate, I just do not know how else to convey my accumulating thoughts. I want to just unplug the drain a bit somewhere and for now, this feels like it helps a bit. Venting is great. A drain that I never feel I have the time to unplug.",0
I am starving and have nothing to lose. I desperately made this account to reach out for help. Please...i just want something in my stomach of substance. Idc if its just a couple dollars.

I feel embarrassed that I am 30 and still suffer with depression. The idea of wanting to hurt or kill myself seems immature and I feel ashamed for feeling it. I feel embarrassed by my mental health when it is bad like this,1
"Been suicidal since 11 or 12 years old. Back then it was just occasional thoughts during tough times (which were often) or times where my depression took over but now at 36 I think about it more than I do not. Deep down I know that my because of death will be suicide and considering over the last 8 months how far I have fallen into the abyss of depression, I know that day is getting close. I used to have a light about me, even in the darkest times, but over the last few years, that light has gone from bright to dim to nonexistent and I know I am nearing the end of my journey. 20+ years of wanting to die",1
"i do not need advice, it will not help. my life has been horrible since i was a young my father died and my mother was abusive my entire life growing up, i just want to die without feeling pain, as I am very afraid of pain from my past of being abused, will someone please tell me how to kill myself without feeling pain for long, i just want to rest please. i have no friends i spend my entire days watching tv shows and playing games to try and detach myself from the real world, anytime i stop doing that all i can think of is how much i hate myself and living, everything is lonely and it hurts. someone please just tell me how to leave I am tired of everyone telling me to stay and that things get better when all they have done is get progressively worse the past 16 years i wish i knew a painless way to kill myself",0
Fucking pill pushing con artists. Share your bad experiences with these scums of the Earth Psychiatry hate thread,0
Just what is the point? No one cares about me or loves me. I do not deserve help. I am just done. there is no reason to go on any longer. I just want the pain to stop. I feel like I just keep going even if I cannot. But I am just done. Everyone who tries to help me either says that they cannot deal with it a couple weeks later. Or they just get angry at me and refuse to help me. what is the point to keep going. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I just sit here in my pain and cry. I am just done. I want it to stop. It hurts so much. I feel so alone. I just want to get a bunch of pills and make the pain go away. I am done,1
"I have done so much work. I go to therapy weekly. I am on medication. I have added so much to my emotional toolbox. I have learned how to cope with extreme emotional pain and how to keep going even when the pain seems unmanageable. I have taken great strides in managing my emotions on my own instead of word vomiting to whoever will listen. And still. I just feel bad. Everything feels pointless. My therapist says I should just accept that I feel bad and not judge myself for feeling bad, but I am so tired of it. I am so tired, period. I do not know who I am, and I do not know what I care about. It kind of feels like I do not care about anything. This is a new depression feeling. I thought I knew how my depression manifested, but every time I think I have got a handle on it, it changes on me. Its not fair. I have done so. much. work. Every time I think I get a handle on my depression, it changes",0

"Hi, i am Andrei, i am 20 years old and i suffer from borderline personality disorder and i triggered myself so bad The Last week. I met a girl at a party and at The party we danced, kissed and hd a good time but The Day after she hd to GO to her grandparents and we texted each other for a week before we met again. At The party i took some anti anxiety pills because i hd an anxiety attack because i got n a fight with my mom and The suicidal thoughts came with a few hours before The party and i went there ready to try to live my life even i took pills and drank alcohol,The Last saturday we went to a date, something more unusual, we went to a old bridge and we stayed on a pillon of concrete for a few hours where i brought a bottle of wine and after that we went to my place and we had sex but i can t wrap my mind around how a person can enjoy me as a whole, how she touched me it seems to me so strange, never felt love and affection from somebody so i don t know how to manage these things and these emotions that is why i took a fucking Viagra so i won t be anxios about my body and to fell that conectivity with this girl which i needed to fell even thought i knew it will ruin my mental state and after that she left and for The next days i felt my bpd and now i am convinced that i have a problem and reddit it s The only place i think i can share these problems, right now my dad it s at The table with me and he does not know nothing about these fellings.

I think i know what i wanted from this girl,:affection love to have a good time with her even thought she will leave my country for good i wanted to have a good time, to fell apreciated and to make me realise life s more than depression, anxiety and suffering, that life s worth living but my BPD makes me fell i am not good enought to start living to the full I have BPD and i can t handle my dark thoughts",0
"My girlfriend recently broke up with me, shortly after starting an internship out of state due to a plethora of issues, including my mental health struggles. Many of the issues she stated are issues I did not know she has, and had I know, I would have worked to fix.I am trying to do anything to mend the relationship, as I love my girlfriend and I acknowledge what I have done wrong, but she states she wants space for a bit and wants to see if I can be the boyfriend she deserves.I do not know what to do. I have made my fair share of mistakes, and I am more than willing to admit it, but I feel absolutely destroyed because we both put so much love into the relationship. It just feels like a switch was pressed, and everything vanished the second it occurred. My girlfriend went from stating she loved me more than anything to being openly critical of me, and it now makes me confused as to whether or not any of those feelings were true, or if she is simply upset and truly does need space after my behavior over the past month.I did not handle the distance well, and it did send me to the mental hospital, amongst other things. I plan to seek out counseling and begin the process of working on myself, but I do not want to have to lose someone I seriously care about. I moved my entire life over here to live with her and pursue our relationship, and all I want is for her to be happy.I feel like all I do is push people away and make things worse, and that I am being gradually erased by everyone I know. I do not know what will even be left of me by the time this is done, and all I want is to be with the person I love and work things out. My girlfriend broke up with me, and now everything seems hopeless",1
Alive while feeling so dead is making me not recognise myself or my life anymore. I think I am going through some sort of dissociation. Sad. cannot do it,0
"Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally do not have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated high-school. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do, but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do, places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that. Anyhow, thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world",1
"It was over something completely benign and I guess I was too scared to actually take enough to kill myself. So now I have ruined a friendship, I have fucked up my whole weekend because I physically and mentally feel awful and I just want to hide away and never look the people in the eye again who I scared with this shit. I guess I just do things for attention now. Part of me wishes I would gone through with it but most of me is glad I do not have to painfully die? Like would have been a pretty random and stupid end to my life. I tried to take a bunch of paracetamol last night",1
"I am just fucking exhausted. I cannot do this shit no more. My life is going nowhere and I do not even give a fuck anymore to try to change it. cannot get a full time job because I always fuck up interviews with the intense anxiety I get during them. I am fucking tired of working retail, I am fucking tired of applying to 20+ jobs a day, I am fucking tired of living with my parents, I am fucking tired of being in debt. I just want to die. It just hurts so bad. Ill definitely be gone before next year. My time is coming soon",1
"I got pregnant on birth control when I was a junior in high school. When I found out I was pregnant I was already too far along. I had my daughter a month after I turned 18. She is 6 now. I have done my best to raise her all by myself. Her dad was physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive to me in front of her. He never helps take care of her and he never pays child support. But he has visitation with her so I still have to deal with him.I do everything I can for my daughter while her dad gets to party, live abroad, date whoever he wants, and do whatever he wants. I finished high school, worked, and went to college. My life has been a cycle of mom, school, mom, work, mom, cook, mom, sleep, mom, repeat for the past 7 years. And I do not think I deserve sympathy for that. I made the choices that brought me here, my daughter did not. She is only here because of me and I owe it to her.I have completely lost myself and I am so depressed. I have not had a social life since high school. I have no friends and I have no hobbies. I do not have time. I have stretch marks and saggy breasts from being pregnant and I hate my body. I did not get the college experience. I had to take online classes so I could take care of my daughter and work. And I had to work remotely because my daughter had to do remote learning during COVID. My daughter's dad barely uses his visitation but I hate having to deal with my abuser. I just want to block him and move on with my life but I constantly have to be reminded of the abuse.I have the most amazing boyfriend. He makes me feel happy and alive. He loves my daughter and she loves him. But I am so scared I am going to ruin it and it makes me depressed. He does not have any kids and I am scared that he is going to get tired of taking care of a kid that is not his or he is going to find someone else who does not have kids. We rarely get to have alone time and do adult things together. And I have never admitted this but I am jealous of him. If he wants to go out and have fun, he can. I wish I could go out with him but I cannot. He has a high-paying job that he gets to travel for. I wish I could have a job like that. I wish I could go on his trips with him. But instead, I am stuck here with my boring low-paying remote job. And he does not have to deal with an abusive ex for the rest of his life.I love my daughter and I feel so guilty saying this. I want to enjoy being a mom so badly but I do not. it is so hard and I am so sad. I wanted to get married and have kids my entire life and this is not how I envisioned my life to go at all. My mom noticed that I am depressed and said that therapy can help me. I agree that I need to go to therapy but I do not know how. My mom also offered to take care of my daughter temporarily so I can get established in a career I enjoy, spend some time with my boyfriend, and get healthy and happy. But would that make me a horrible mom? I just do not know anymore. :( Single mom and struggling",0

"For context, I am 22 years old going on 23. And these past 4 years have been taken away from me and continue to just wither away because of illnesses. When all I wanted was to live a life of peace. I never asked to be rich, never asked to be successful. I just wanted to be alone and happy to my own devices. But that is apparently too much to ask for. Instead, I gained rare chronic illnesses that for whatever reason progresses and takes away pieces of my life. Whilst also being underfunded whilst society does not give a shit about the unhealthy. I can now think about suicide like it is nothing, I am no longer afraid of death. It seems a lot more peaceful than what my life is now. Visual Snow Syndrome that progresses and continues to become more severe for no apparent reason, afterimages that torture and fill up my vision both positive and negative. Light sensitivity, warping you name it. it is supposed to become stable after 2 years, which seems like a lie considering it is only gotten worse for the past 4. Then, there is tinnitus. I hear multiple **5 to 6 sounds** spread across my ears, permanently. All different, some even sound reactant. Hissing, ringing, ""morse code"". And it never stops. And then to top it all off...**Hyperacusis** that has gotten worse very recently. Something that has taken me well over the edge of ""Oh fuck it all"". I was still considered strong prior to this funnily enough, so long as I had my music to escape and whatever vision I had to play videogames or watch movies etc, I will be fine I thought. Then god once again fucked me, worsening something that only 0.6%(?) of people on this earth has. Sound sensitivity. It is fucking torture. I can no longer do or enjoy basic things that people use to escape a nightmare. Everything, has been taken away from me. And I did not have much left. Not only are two of these conditions considered rare, but they are underfunded by a society that does not give a fuck about unhealthy people. And then you see it on the news, two billionaires using money for flying out to space for shits n giggles. Leaving you behind. Which only results in demoralization that people like that can exist while everyday you wake up looking into a mirror as a broken husk. Ending my life would be a genuine blessing. I have given up on both myself and society as a whole. Just fuck this shitstain world. God is wanting me to suffer, my life is literally a nightmare",1
"My mother tells me there is an absent glare in my eyes again, that she is losing that once was her little girl. Although I am at one of my lowest moments, a part of me feels at ease. I do not know how else to describe it. My mind feels sharper, deep in thought. I have motivation to write, whether or not it makes sense. I can write for hours. Not necessarily poems or stories but words that I cannot vocalise. It all comes out at once, so freely. I just want my voice to be heard. I feel like a part of me has gone and I do not know whether I want it back.",0
"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never. So do you know any cults with charismatic father-figures? Can be a suicide cult. Incurable mental pain",1
"I have not been a good brother to my sister I admit, she is a really good person that I take for granted. During the pandemic she had a lot of mental episodes that were difficult to be around and we got into it a lot and it further distanced our relationship (we had other things that contributed to that distance as well). I feel bad for the things I have done and I have apologized but I still feel bad. I have changed from the person I was and I think she sees that but does not want to acknowledge that. I love her so much and I think she is a phenomenal person and a naturally good soul. I have such a hard time forgiving myself. I wish I could be different. I wish I was capable of being the person I wished I was. I am so disappointed in myself",0

They make suicide jokes and think its funny. I do not want to die I just want to feel happy again like when I was little. Everyone tells me its going to be ok but when ? I just want a hug from someone telling me that its going to be ok and that I do not have to cry and that I am not alone.

English sounds great too but the career opportunities are more than bad.I have applied to so many majors at different unis but it are not worth writing about.What if no matter my effortsIm going to kill myself? If it will be too much?I hate the thought of killing myself but its constantly on my mind so I guess its what I have to do some day.Its kind of funny because I never thought of life being this miserable when I was a kid.Was and is my dad abusive?yes. But I still had the fire in me you know.Its such a struggle. Do I need a lot of money? No, but I am unhappy with my body and my face so I need surgery,skincare products etc to feel worthy. Worthy to stay alive.Soyeah actually I DO need more money aka a well paying job but most jobs require degrees in field which make me want to kill myself even more because I do not feel skilled enough and will not graduate whatsoever.Looks like I am going to disappoint my inner child and die without reaching any of my goals. I have always dreamt of being an actress or working in a museum/book shop but it will not happen,thanks to the money issue and lack of will to live.Nothing special in my lifes going to happen because I will, as mentioned before, probably kill myself no matter what. I have a feeling that I am destined to commit suicide",0
"like title, this happened before a few years back when i was really depressed and stopped talking to most my friends. this time around i only had about one friend and I am pretty sure she is done with me. i do not know what to do really pretty sure i lost all my friends",0
"I have never wanted to tell my mom I am depressed until I could prove her that clinically, because I knew she would not understand. Today she told that she is embarrassed that I am not able to take care of myself despite me making huge progress for the past week.I want to throw myself out the window. My biggest fear came true. My mom told me she is ashamed of my depression",0
"From the day I was born I was abused I was not even supposed to be born, My dad started molesting me at 3:00 to leave to 10:00 and traffick me to other men for moneyMy sister brother and mother were any better really they sexually abused me physically and mentally emotionally as wellI have so much depression about everything I have been through I am still financially dependent on my mother somewhat as I have extreme post-traumatic stress among other things.All she does is pretty much make me anxious by bothering me with questions insulting me and making rude comments about the state of my apartment because I am depressed and it is hard for me to keep it clean she will come to help me clean but then she will not talk to me at all and be Curt then be nice then be cured again then start yelling and making bad comments about where I live. I had to tell her to leave last night but she would not leave I was crying hysterically my bedroom because I am trying to leave and abusive government housing situation.And she did not say a word even though she heard me and I just felt so unloved and uncared forI started just losing it and saying like go back to your perfect life then because I have to live in this awful while everyone else seems to be doing relatively okay and I mentioned my dad raping me which she denied but when I first told her she did not deny it and she confirmed but now she says I am crazy and then it never happened and I have a disorder.I always internally feel like this mentally psycho messed up ungrateful person. I have no friends I cannot keep them because they cannot support me at the emotional depth that I need, they all end up just taking advantage of me and when I need them they are nowhere to be found I tried to just have friends that I can be casual with but they just want to take from me they cannot even just have a conversation with me about TV shows without asking something from from me or making a snotty remark.I have a small business but it is extremely hard for me because it is on social media seeing the numbers go up and down with my followers makes it hard especially as I am becoming more real of who I am. I cannot separate my business from who I am it is very important that I spread awareness about social issues as well as what I went through being trafficked. I am on assistance and I am scared they will cut me off because I have not reported my earnings because if I do that they will cut my check for the next month and since I do not make consistent income it is not a good idea for me but in the end I lose anyways.My building is government they treat you like garbage they take your full amount of rent you get from the government and leave you in an apartment that is a death trap in a fire hazard no matter what you do or you call no one gives a s***.I actually really do love myself and care about myself and there is a lot of things that I love in life but it is getting to the point where how can I survive when I do not even have a decent support network and it is hard for me to even get out of bed. I tried to have my mom help me and clean but obviously the emotions are too untangled there and the way she treats me when she comes as if as if I am a huge burden and I cannot do it myself and she just snaps at me and I feel so trapped. This place is giving me money to move but they are not helping me whatsoever I have never lived in apartment by myself that has not been government I have no idea what they want and they have just basically said we have money in your lucky to have it you are ahead of the edge but they kind of just throw me to the Wolves I am indigenous/white as well and the funding is linked through indigenous funding so as well as you know assistant so I am scared I will end up in a worse place than I am already in. I thought I would be able to stay at this building in particular for a little bit longer since it had mental health case supports a doctor's office in it things like that but the support staff here are condescending rude recap privilege look down upon you talk over you hang the phone up on you if you do not behave and you do not cooperate you are treated like a client in a mental in a mental institution and treated like you do not know anything you are not smart you are a degenerate and no requests you have for your disabilities are met with any type of meaningful conversation just stonewalling even if you go to your doctor get a note or the Human Rights association like I'mlosing a battle hereAnyways I live everyday and anxiety my heart pounding I live in terror that these people are going to hurt me because I am speaking out about the abuse and I am just scared they are going to hurt me anyways because the last maintenance man was sexually assaulting the tenants here and he got fired but there is two other maintenance men that are just as bad so I put a double lock on my door and I have a knife beside me at nightThis is no way to live and no one understands how hard it is to find a place as one person by yourself and not get scammed and make sure it is okay and it is safe and that I do not end up on the streets again. I do not understand like everyone around me just lacks empathy and any type of emotional intelligence they do not listen to what I want they do not listen to what type of apartment I want and I just want to give up like I am just overwhelmed and these people want too much from me and then they get almost mad because I cannot do it but then they send me listings that are completely what I told them not and I am just feeling disrespected at this point and I tell them but nothing changesI feel like nothing changes ever no matter what I do I am just exhausting myself on a f****** hamster wheel no one can help me no one ever does I do not deserve this.I do not see any light at the end of the tunnel I do not have one person in my life that has my best interest in mind.I do not really want to die but I do not want to live like this and I do not want it to get worse. Suicidal thoughts are always in the background of my life",1
"I am a mess, i fuck up all the time and i cannot do this anymore. i thought i could maybe hold on for a little longer but everything is just so hard, i cannot handle all of this, my pretty good friend from the psychiatric hospital is struggling and i cannot do anything to help them, I am so hopeless. i just want to end it all, i kind of have a plan but i need to leave my house to accomplish it and its so hard. i wish i could just disappear i really want to kill myself so badly",1
"being sad sucks, but at least with me, I had someone to help me not feel so aloneBut then there is the anger. That I would usually direct at the friend, over the idea I got into my head they were trying to be mean to me. Or I was just so angry at them for doing better than I was. it is so messed up but I felt, and still do maybe, like they wanted me punished and to feel bad, so I would spit venom at them. They left, naturally as one would do. I am still angry when I think I would rather just be crying right now. Both suck but I do not like being this angry at all. I mean, had a failed suicide attempt last week, but it was out of heartbreak and depression. Sure, those hurt, but adding in anger just hurts so much more. Now I am just sitting here a week later, (maybe mor actually, I do not pay much attention to the date anymore) sad and fuming at myself for being stupid about ensuring I would be alone forever and being mean to literally the only person who gave a damn about me. Or I would hope they did;See, the depression's so bad just also has me thinking that I do not know what is real and if people are out to get me. Joy, paranoia is just what I need to tack onto my issues /sBut that is Something else to talk to my therapist about pointlessly for 40 minutes before I go back to laying in bed being sad and angry at myself and imagining that everyone hates me, even though I do not speak to anyone regularly and I do not go out much. My therapist is great, sound advice that I just do not understand how to do or I ruined my life already so starting over seems less ideal than just giving up. that is my vent. And yes I am very embarrassed about it. Supposed to be able to deal with stuff and keep it to myself and not bother others but tonight sucked. going to go eat yogurt and then pass out for the night hoping that entire pizza I ate earlier gives me a heart attack in my sleep or someshit, bleh. I would really prefer the crushing sadness by itself than the mix of rage, tbh",1
"...because I can never get good at anything. If I pick up a hobby, I do it for a few weeks, then hit an obstacle or get bored of it and just give up. This has been happening for years. For example: I started drawing multiple times and I am still about as good as a toddler. No matter what I try, I cannot stick with anything ever. I think it has to do with the executive function in my brain being banged up, I cannot organise myself. it is frustrating nonetheless as it is really all my fault, because I know I could have been good if only I pushed myself more. I get these depressive episodes where I hardly do anything but eat and sleep and those days could have been spent doing something actually worthwhile. Feel like such a loser...",0
"I was going to type out all the shitty things that just happened to me but now I am getting less upset and more numb. Either way what I need to get out is I was upset and instead of my dad giving me the space that I needed he forcefully held me in place, while I was telling him to let go, forced me to look into his eyes as he attempted to comfort me? Not even like a hug just trapped me. I have never felt so violated in my life. It made me feel 10 times worse and I started crying writing this just thinking about it again. Had a shit night and now morning. I do not know how long I can deal with this anymore.",0

"A few months ago my partner finally convinced me to go to a doctor. For many years I have had this deep sadness to everything in my life, at times it makes it hard to persist. I reached out twice and each time I have said why am I sad I have been met with the same response everyone gets sad, you will get over it and I did not. When my grades slipped in highschool and I turned to my teachers and parents for support their answer was not is something wrong it was always you are fine, go study harder and this has had a primarily adverse affect. Over time this had turned into a resentment and an ignorant denial of mental health when others have said they have had it. I have thought Oh, you are sad, I am sad to and that is normal. So earlier this year I got help. I was scared, so nervous, shaking before I saw the doctor. He was so nice and serious about it all. I did not feel the need to avoid a deep conversation about the topic and instead speak openly with him. This was fresh air. So I get my diagnosis for anxiety and depression. And I am bewildered. I have been told my entire life you are fine and someone to actually say no this is not the norm was a welcome sight. Even now, when I tell people off my diagnosis, they look at me with skepticism and doubt. Like I am lying or fabricating a story. For most off my life people have called me a psychopath for my lack of empathy towards others so I understand their confusion when I do say yes, I am human. So I started taking anti-depresents, hoping it would be a cure. But it changed my depression not fixed it. It made me unable to leave bed most days and not even be able to study for University. It made me hate myself. And once again, my grades dropped. And no one wondered why (thankfully my University was incredibly understanding go Curtin). So now I am here. About to start a new semester. These days I have been struggling with thoughts of suicide. I doubt it will happen but its a persistent nagging thought. I am to embarrassed to talk to anyone near me as I still have a slight stigma against people who wear depression as a personality and i feel incredibly uncomfortable getting compliments or sympathy. Hence why I made this post. I may even delete it in the morning out of regret. So if anyone sees this, what advice do you have for coping? I have started meditation but want to make life easier to live.Thank you My experience",0
"Man, sometimes I jump from "" I want to kill myself and life is worthless"" to "" raimbows, glitter ,cute things and lil frogs"" to "" an oddball that just want to smash stuff"" and then "" anxiety oddball"". And that happens so fuking fast. What the fuck is happening?",1
I am not sure if I am living anymore or just taking up space. I wish I could find a purpose. Something... Anything to give myself a meaning to being alive. I know I should not be thinking such dark thoughts but I cannot help it anymore. Just let me drown for once. Let me fall apart. Stop caring for me just because I do not seem ok anymore. Truth is I have not been for a while. I have been holding onto every last thread within reach. I am TRYING TRUST ME I AM. but it hurts to breathe... do not you get it? IT HURTS.... so fking badly.... can someone just... pls ... hold me... bc i cannot anymore... floating.,0

"he is constantly on my mind. I feel debilitated. It fucking sucks. I want to be in his arms again, falling asleep on his chest. I miss my best friend. I am worried he does not feel the same or even think of me. Am I forgotten?? Missing my ex. Struggling with moving forward.",0
"As far as I can remember, I did not have a hard time growing up. At least not comparatively. My parents materially supported me, never hurt me physically, and took me to the doctor and to school every day. I did well in school. I had friends. And I am ""talented"" But I am also depressed and an alcoholic.I do not know anyone else in my family that suffers from depression. I do not know anyone else who has a drinking problem. Yet, here I am. When I was little I wondered if I was adopted. I did not belong to my family in some undetectable, covert way. a changling. something. and I still feel that way.I just do not understand myself on a fundamental level. I feel like I want to die, but it is a very specific type of wanting to die. I want to restart. I fantasize about restarting. Like in a videogame, when you can ""re-spec"" your character and make them more of what you want instead of what you spent all those hours mistakenly turning yourself into. that is how I feel about my life. I have spent the past 10 years grinding to get XP in a skill I do not even want anymore. And I do not know what else I would rather be doing either. So I keep grinding. It feels empty. Even when I am recognized for how good I am at my job, it means nothing. *It means Nothing.* No amount of love from a partner makes me feel loved. No amount of praise makes me feel praised. No amount of anything makes me feel anything but *just so goddamned sad.* I have a friend who has been in an outpatient mental hospital for six months who I am so jealous of. I want to drop everything and do that. I want to check out, but then my life would fall apart and all of the XP I have been building up would become even more meaningless. I would lose my job altogether and in some ways, it is the only tangible connection to reality I have left.They say the conditions for suicidal ideation are alienation and despair. I feel both. And I have tried forcing myself to alleviate those things. Going out, attempting to date. I have been sober for over a year. But I still hate myself and want to die. Sometimes I wish I could point to something and say ""there! that is what is wrong with me! that is why I do not fit in in the world!"" but I do not have that. it is just something I am, vs something that happened to me. If that makes sense. I feel incredibly selfish just feeling this way. So many people would love my life if they had it. instead, I am slowly letting it rot away as I consider self-harm again for the first time since I was a teenager. I have already begun food restriction, which is a tactic I used as a teen to feel some kind of control over my self-hatred. Sometimes, now, I hit myself or run into things to help feel ""punished"" enough to move on from bad feelings and mistakes. I have not cut yet, but the idea of it makes me salivate. I do not know what to do. It feels like no one understands. I hope you do. I am living my dream---why does it make me want to die",1
"I just hate myself, I cannot take it anymore, everything was supposed to be fine, but I just cannot, in my head, killing myself sounds so right, I cannot see myself living, I am so tempted to just end, I do not know, in my pint of view my life is just wrong and killing myself is the solution. If I work this out, will anything change? At this point I judt do not know anymore. I am sick of myself",0

I am going to beat depression into a pulp",0
"I know for a fact that Id never commit suicide, mostly on an emotional relationship factor so if that fell apart this sentence no longer applies but it will not, trust me. My point is I cannot tell my doctor I have suicidal ideations even on my antidepressants like its so hard to get rid of them that I have started using them as a coping mechanism like just thinking about certain scenarios when I get upset. I know some of you all are going to yell for me to get some help but this is actually a serious question. Also is it normal for your meds to not actually get rid of your depression but just tone it down because that is the closest thing I can relate this to at the moment.Wellbutrin 300mg max dose. (For those wondering)Word to mods: please do not take this down, I am not glamorizing suicide I am simply asking for some opinions on this subject. also I should repeat that I AM NOT SUICIDAL. cannot I have my suicidal ideations in peace as long as I have no intent?",0
"I am so proud of myself. I finally got my butt back into therapy after struggling for the past three years and was diagnosed with severe depression (no surprise I just think I did not want to hear it). I am finally being consistent with getting help since this therapist is a great match for me. they are smart, quick witted, and good at calling me out on my bs and getting me to reflect on my own thought patterns. While I still do not feel better I feel more hopeful and I am grateful. I have started to enjoy life again. I have taken it upon myself to finally start making healthy changes in my life to recreate a headspace that invites more positive thoughts. Some things I have done the past few months to force myself out of the comfort of my sadness: - I have started journaling again. Every morning I try and write down one thing I am grateful for in my life. My therapist also recommended I journal every time my mood plummets so I can get it off my mind and on to paper. - I quit vaping. Vaping was a terrible crutch I used to aid my anxiety, it was not an easy quite but its been a couple months now and it feels good to be free. - I started reading again. I replaced my phone time at night with books so I can get away from social media. I am extra proud of this because its been years since I have read for pleasure and I forgot how much I loved it. I just finished my first book since starting again and I hope this is something that I can keep up. - I started learning how to reach out to friends and family when I am having a bad day. Swallowing my pride was hard. I believed I always had to be 100% happy all the time so no one would ever worry about me or think less of me. I am grateful for the support system I have. To everyone who is still struggling I hope you are able to get the support you need. Depression is nasty but I hope you find someone or something to help you bear the weight. I am proud of you for living. I wanted to share my small wins &amp; progress :)",0
"I have been getting bad again.

"I am definitely deleting this in a few minutes, I just want someone to read it so I feel heard ig, God I am so pathetic lol but anyway, I have been trying to get better for the last couple of weeks and it has been so tiring, everyday I have to go through 7655431 fights with myself just to keep going, my mood changes countless times during the day and whenever I fall down I only have myself to get me up, I can just imagine how easier it would have been if I had someone who is actually there for me, someone I can turn to when I need but apparently I will not get to experience that, still I will keep trying my best to be strong enough to actually make a change in my mental health cuz right now it is the only thing I can try to control, other things are just out of my hands, it is just that I feel there is no point of the whole things ya know like rn I got nothing, not even hope for a better future so it is like this fight is based on nothing, I just need to get my shit together before school starts cuz I cannot risk messing up my grades in my senior year but today I could not do anything to stop myself of being miserable and I just surrendered, it is still 1:30 pm where I live but today we have a family gathering and shit which I hate so much and I am already in a very fucked up mood so I will just have to sit there and pretend like I am a normal person while I feel like jumping of the roof lol, I just hope this is a one day fuck up cuz I do not have time to go in a month depression acoma, yea if anyone read this, thanks &lt;3 I just want to feel heard for a minute",0
"I feel like I am giving slowly, my only option now is to probably get on some kind of antidepressant before I end up killing myself. It seems that there is not much else I can do otherwise. I talk a lot to my friends, in general I cannot complain about having a lack of people yo talk to. But I lack the ability to derive I guess, some kind of feeling of security from even that, they are good friends, I just cannot connect with them it seems. That problem has had me thinkimg about death all to often, n just sustaining myself with distraction really, it feels like things are all over the place, but I want to get better, I will try to get some antidepressants n see if they help, I do not feel like doing this just as I am without some kind of help anymore. I just feel like I am drifting",0

"I have been to a lot of therapists, and one used to ask me every week ""Any suicidal ideation?"" I would always say ""No,"" even though it was almost always a lie.I have not ever really come close to killing myself. The closest I have ever come is pondering the logistics of killing myself if I ever decided to (e.g. method, location, etc). I have not gone to the store to buy rope, or bought firearms or anything like that (and do not intend to). The vast majority of the time, it is not even that. it is mostly just ""I really do not want to be alive anymore; it hurts too much.""But I guess I am not sure what the upside of telling this to a therapist? what is the point? I can talk about the stuff that is bothering me anyway; how does this add anything to the conversation?As far as downsides, being involuntarily committed to a mental institution is one of my worst fears. My understanding is that you can only be involuntarily committed if you pose a ""danger to yourself or others."" I do not think I do, but I also worry that telling a therapist that I am thinking about suicide will take that determination out of my hands. I would rather my therapist did not have to ask the question ""Does this guy pose a risk to himself or others?""I live in Pennsylvania, if that matters. Is there any point to telling a therapist that I am experience suicidal ideation?",1
"I am a 19 y.o. who recently lost her mom due to surgery complications. My mom had an arterial bypass in her groin (less than 3% death rate; 95% success rate) and the surgery went fine. After, she could not keep her temp and blood pressure up, and passed away the next morning (were still waiting for her autopsy results.) My mom went under anesthesia and never woke up. She was sedated the whole time, even when she had a wound vac and her incision wide open (the doctor kept it open so he could look later, sewing her up would risk infection.) My mom died with an open incision and a super puffy face. She looked so uncomfortable. She probably contracted sepsis, but that is not what I am here to talk about.Seeing her die made me realize how close and possible it is for me to die any day. I saw her at the funeral home, and she looked nothing like herself. Death scares me now, and its hard for me to believe there is an afterlife. I just wish she is here with me and knows how sorry I am that she had to die like that. I also feel lots of guilt, as I have dealt with depression and anxiety and would take it out on her a lot (we were also best buddies, she loved me more than anything and always told me that.) I just need some peace and I do not know how to not feel angry and guilty. I am an only child and a mamas girl. I have my dad who loves me very much, but my mom was my whole world. I was her whole world too. My mom passed away two weeks ago, and since then my views on death are now scarier and more unsettling.",0
"I failed an attempt a week back and have not told anyone or really unpacked it. I broke down when it failed but I have been numb ever since. When I thought I was dying I did not feel scared, I felt relieved. I felt better than I have in so, so long. I found myself dwelling on whether or not anything would happen after I die or if my consciousness would simply cease to exist, and the thought of nothingness did not bother me at all. I cannot believe a week has already passed. Nothing changed. I want to try again, but it is hard to come up with another method in my situation.It bothers me that I have to put so much thought into carefully planning my escape. Why are we forced to live against our will? I would not have to resort to such awful methods if I could be straightforward and honest. Instead, I am paranoid about raising suspicion and have to avoid so many methods that would be quick and painless simply because I cannot risk anyone finding out. it is absurd.Part of me is disappointed that it was so easy to pick myself up and recover from my attempt. Makes me feel like I did not get close at all. The other part of me is glad that I do not have any lasting symptoms. Life does not need to be more painful than it already is.Not sure what this post is supposed to be. This community cannot help me, but at least I can talk about things that I cannot normally talk about. Failed attempt",1
"Okay, I do not know where to start and it is going to be pretty unorganised. And I cannot completely express myself, so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig, I not sure.I am introvert, antisocial, athiest , logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage , you know , so that they feel it ig , that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday , shouting and wasting your time , just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you , I do not want to talk to you, but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep, I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made , how stupidly wrong they were , it is not like I am correct, but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words , it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain, is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like , I cannot do anything now , I do not care , I will just move on, but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that, why did not I say that and get depressed everytime. I am sure that I am going to struggle my entire life and end up destroying opportunities and just imagine how my life would have been better. I am lonely , never been in a relationship and have few online friends which is another source of depression and there are more things . Sorry if I have been just repeating topics also it was not as interesting and thank you if you read all of this . Idk why am I sharing this , idc about upvotes, It is just like when I am explaining about how wrong people were about the concepts , to myself, which does makes me somewhat happy ig ,but I end up in depression again , bc that is not going to happen. It always ends up in my mind.",0

"I had a friend who dated this guy, who would not stop messaging her for several months after they broke up. Mind you, she has not responded to him. Hes having a conversation with himself and he goes from well good bye you will not hear from me again to I hope things go well for you after a few months. Its honestly distressing. Why do people think its okay to make suicide threats as a form of manipulation?",1
Everything feels like its falling apart. And I have zero control over any of it. I do not know how to even begin fixing everything that is wrong. Its all so daunting and I feel like I will not be able to do it. I am trying so hard to be here for my SO. Seeing them everytime I wake up can sometimes make it all bearable. But I do not feel like I am strong enough to actually keep going. I have lost every ounce of faith in myself. I do not want to fucking be here anymore.,1

"I know this does not really fit here but it still kind of does because these are the pieces of S- I have had to grow up with and deal with on a daily basis. They got tested for COVID and their results came back positive and they are still acting like it is not worth worrying about just because they are lucky enough their symptoms are not that bad.. they gave it to me too and I have been doing the best I can taking all of the precautions this whole time to avoid getting it.. I tried to tell them to stop going places without a mask because they have COVID, stop going places at all, but they insist they still have to live their lives and that its not that bad.. I honestly wish their COVID was a worst case scenario.. because they truly deserve it.. who knows what they are actively doing to other peoples lives.. I have struggled for a long time with how I feel about them because they are my family.. but they are just evil.. knowing you have the virus and still going and spreading it so you will not be slightly inconvenienced, or worse to prove a point, at this point they are just literally evil I feel awful that I cannot do anything to stop them from doing this, no matter what they will not stop.. is this a crime? If it is I would like to report them honestly My POS parents keep going into stores without a mask on while knowing they have COVID",0

"My partner and I are both 18 and recently just finished high school (we are together for almost 2 years now). We also just finished applying for different colleges and results came out today; I failed and she passed. Initially of course, I felt happy for her. Though passing that school did not mean anything for her, it is obvious that she is going to choose the school which is the top school in the country, over a school that both of us passed and could go together.I have mixed feelings about it to be honest. Initially like I said, I felt a sudden burst of happiness because she deserves that success. Followed by that I felt a teeny bit of jealousy, because it is my dream school ever since I was a child, and ever since we have became couples/partners, she has been part of my dream too. I dreamt that I could go to the same college as she would and finish together. We were classmates for 2 years during highschool and I think I have grown so attached to her that I do not even want her to leave me anymore.But I know better. I know that people should prioritize themselves first and their future before anything else and I get that. But to be honest, I am really scared right now. I am scared that we will not experience the same college moments as we had in high school, I am scared that she might meet new people, and I am scared about what could happen to her and I would not be there to guide her.Ever since I got the news of failing and ever since I have thought about these thoughts, my world just kept falling apart. I have not been taking care of myself; eating little to none, sleeping for 2 hours, or often no sleep at all.I am scared of the changes that is about to happen and I do not know what else I could do.

"I have been debating making a post here but today I told myself I need to share in hopes of helping anyone struggling like I have. Quick backstory. Been majorly depressed since I was 16. On and off anti depressants and anti anxiety meds, sleeping pills etc. Had an unsuccessful suicide attempt at 17. Out patient psychiatric care, therapy, social work..it goes on. Mother was diagnosed with cancer when I was 16 and shortly after became terminal. She passed when I was 24 but between 16-24 was a roller coaster of hell. Pretty much decided I would die when she died. That did not happen. I was faced with the reality of life and realized I had another chance.Cut to today..I am 29 and I have a beautiful 4 year old daughter. I recently got a job at a cafe and have been on Effeczor for a few months. Its really helping. I finally feel some progress and some positivity.I have felt completely hopeless and worthless and cold in my past. So lost, so dark and just did not give a fuck about anything. Loosing my mother and gaining a daughter showed me how precious life is and how easily lost it can be. I know you and I see you. I am you. I am sure if I were in one of my depressive episodes I would read this and say ew. Lol. But please remember you are worth it. You have a purpose. You are loved. If by no one then I love you and please do not give up.I promise there is a way out for you and do not stop fighting for yourself.Reach out and get well.Thanks for letting me share. Hello friends! Small success story I am hoping will reach some of you.",0

"Hey guys,I have been depressed most my adult life but these past few years have been really bad. Back in 2016 I developed this headache and neck pain that to this day pretty much runs my whole life. I have had a headache of just about every minute of every day since one specific day in 2016. No doctor has ever been able to figure out. So I am forced to just live in pain and basically act like its not there if I want to try and do much of anything. I had dreams and goals since I was in HS. I wanted to be a P.H.d molecular biologist doing some sort of academic research or work in industry. I worked really hard and got into the best uni in my state, got a full ride, and during college did fairly well with a lot of new aspirations developing. I was depressed on and off during this time. Usually having to do with girls or test grades or finances. Stuff that you can deal with. But all in all i had a lot of friends and would say I was generally a happy person.Then the headache hit. I always thought it would just go away one day but as the months grew I started to isolate and become incredibly depressed. I got through school but it was so ugly. Had to use substances just so that I could even study molecular biology. At this point I was starting to get really upset with everything. Often I would get upset with my friends and peers because they did not have to deal with this. I would get invited to stuff but honestly nothing is fun anymore, especially social situations. I moved across the country after college to get a job and hopefully start fresh. But nothing changed. At this point I am basically certain this medical condition and the depression are here to stay forever. Imagine having a good child hood, got everything we needed, great education growing up, no child trauma at all, get a full ride for the school/degree you have been wanting for years and graduate. Only to realize that nothing you accomplish will make you happy. It hurts more than the headache itself lately. My soul is wounded and I have completely lost hope. I have been on and off meds for a few years and none of them help.And the thing that makes me suicidial is when my friends and family act like I am doing great because I have a fancy job a nice car and my own place. I have told them how I experience the world and some of them just do not believe it and attack my character. I feel like a lost sheep alienated from the world. I am basically jealous of every single person I interact with. Lately I will be walking around near my apartment and I will seriously get jealous of homeless people. All I want is to enjoy this beautiful world and enjoy my accomplishments and the company of loved ones. depression and chronic health problems",0
"I find I am either in a state of intensity where my head is buzzing with so many ideas and thoughts that I can barely sleep to a state of emptiness and depression that is so heavy it is almost indescribable. I am rarely ever in the middle as of the last two years, but I am always suicidal, never fearing death. I have only really stayed alive at this point because I have no easy access to anything besides perhaps if I jumped in front of a car. I just want to sleep and never wake up, to not have to worry about slugging through the days that blur into one another. I feel a year could pass and it would feel as though I have not moved at all, like I am trapped inside a void purgatory. I want to sleep, I do not want to have to do this just to barely make it through each day and be crying by the time I get to bed having to think about doing it all over again. The ping pong between the highs and the lows is too exhausting",1
"that is it, all I need is one bad day where it becomes too much and its over. there is no one there to talk me out of what I am doing or hear me and stop me when I am halfway through hanging or find me and call and ambulance and save me. Its kind of liberating knowing the next time I have a bad day that I could be out of here. If I died at my home nobody would know I was gone for months. Perfect. The best part about living alone is all I need is one bad day and I am gone",0
"Hi, I am new to Reddit and this is my first vent post, so this might be a little long and all over the place. I just wanted to rant about some things I have been feeling lately. Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete, my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected, and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to, all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless, pathetic loser. I just want to die, but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it, so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore. I do not understand anything and I am so tired of my mind being like this. I do not know what to do or how to help myself anymore. I just want to give up. I feel stuck in this deep hole and have no hope of getting myself out of it.",0

"Hello, I am 30 and I do not have a life nor prospects for a career. I was depressed due to abusive parents and the great recession. Then I failed to find a job that would allow me to support myself after I graduated college at 21. I coasted for a year doing odd jobs and several vacations. Soon afterwards I became severely depressed and went catatonic until recently. that is just the background. I was a top 20% student coming out of high school (despite already being depressed.) Although due to self harm as a teenager I have a bad back and knees so cannot do anything where I need to stand or work with my hands. As my mental health continued to decline I had to switch to a humanities major and graduated with a 3.6 GPA. Those circumstances combined with mental health issues leads to where I am at today. I actually spent the pandemic trying to go back to school studying computer science, but I am unable to retain any information. I ended up with a 3.2 GPA and I was only taking 2 courses per semester at a relatively easy school.I was and am an attractive person so I had no trouble getting laid while on vacation several years back. My appearance is not the issue, I look almost the same, I have severe mental health issues that prevent me from having log term relationships with anyone let alone a romantic partner. I am not an incel per say, but not having a social life has had a huge impact on my mental health. (I strongly suggest to most depressed high school students --whose main source of depression is parental/social-- to do whatever it takes to move out after high school.)At this point I am extremely insecure, have no self esteem nor self confidence, I am broke and have no friends. I am being evicted me and so after failing to secure gainful employment this summer have decide the objective choice is suicide. I know I am a complete failure, but I do not believe in myself so I have opened the floor to your input. 30 with no life experience or prospects.",1
"Hope this is allowed if not get rid of it . Just wanted to get something off my chestIm 22 recently graduated from college I found out at half one this morning thst i was rejected for my dream job (througha friend thst got onto the next stsge) . Another rejection to add to the list. I have already been rejected by all the other msjor companies in the field I am graduating into in this country. I am a laughing stock and a waste of space. A let down to my fsmily and all my dead relatives whom I promised that i would make proud. I have not. I cannot put myself through another interview process. How could I? I will be turned down . I know I am good at what I do but nobody can see that. The people who matter do not have faith in me. what is wrong with me? Why am i so useless as a person? As for my personal life? Another stream of rejections. Any time I get close to somebody romantically it takes them about 3 dates for her to realise I am a waste of their time. I am not a horrible person either. Quite the opposite I have been told that too often I am too nice to people. Maybe that is my lack of worth as a person manifesting itself through helping somebody else. I do not hate my life i just hate that I am who I am . I wish I could be anybody else. Somebody of worth. Somebody that is not humiliated every time they do an interview, every time they ask a girl out, everytime they think they are getting somewhere. Why bother? I am a waste of breath and I wish i could change thst but I am too far gone. Before you think my ill feeling towards myself manifests itself in interviews etc it does not i cover it up. And the last time i was told i was not good enough for a job ie todsu it was not even an interview as such but a task. I do not even know why I am posting this. It is not a cry for help, it is not a pity me fest. it is more so a case of needing to get it off my chest. Sorry for being a burden not only to you but onto my fsmily and my wider social circle. I had not seen a man more useless until i looked in the mirror. Have a nice day, i can assure you it will be better than mine I feel completely useless and hopeless. I am a joke of a person . Endless rejections in personal amd work life have made me realise how worthless I am.",0

I did not want a broken family, an only functioning eye and depression. Last thing I want to have is being depressed while begging attention and comfort from friends. This just show how vulnerable I can be and it feels shit. Craving that attention and love because I am incapable of loving myself damn right. I thought life was going well but not until last night, I spiralled down again just because I got a degrading comment. Ah yes an Asian who has not achieved anything in her 20s boo hoo while being visually impaired. Realizing how pointless life is, family, work, relationships and basically existing itself. Screw supernatural shit, life and everything else. Nothing is exciting. Games, movies and junk foods that makes you forget how shitty life is. The food tastes crap, the weather is all gloom and if I could just throw everything away including me I would be happyWhen you are a kid life is pretty colorful and now it is just grey and boring as fuck. Guess what? Being an adult means you deal with life's crap oh and be the bread winner too. Why tf are we here on earth?",1

"I feel so empty inside. I have lost all of my friends, and I am so lonely. Every day is the same. Wake up, do chores, eat, sleep...over and over...every day. I am always tired and just want to sleep all day. it is the only thing that makes me feel happy. it is great to imagine being a different me, in a happier life. I have a lot of self-hate and pretending to be someone I am not, makes me feel better the moment I am dreaming, but only makes the pain hurt more once I wake up. I have tried to talk about these things to my mom, but it is hard to confide in a parent who constantly manipulates you and emotionally abuses you. Anytime I wanted to talk about anything, it always ends up being my fault. it is mentally, and physically draining. My dad on the other hand is someone I could confide in, but I feel it would because more problems. My parents are constantly fighting, and my dad is an alcoholic. There has been some physical abuse, but never towards me. it is so painful and sad to watch my parents fight, and I am just stuck. I have nowhere to go. No one to talk to.

"I have been for few years feeling sadder and worst. It started when I realised who am I. I was trying to stay positive and funny for my friends and classmates. But when I am alone, there in no escape from my thoughts. What I did wrong, how I did it ect. For understanding next part, I am student of electrical engineering, since I was little everybody was telling me how smart I am, but I do not feel like it. Even now when someone ask me to do something, I can say no, so I will take it. But I cannot push myself to do it or if it is half way done, I cannot finish it. Studying is hard for my because I am loosing focuse. So in the end everyone is angry on me that I did not do. Even worse, my GF broke up with me, and few days after she was with somebody else (back then I was trying to look as nice as nice as I could and threatening her like a queen. I did not argue when she block all my friends on my phone, telling them I did not want to see them). That pulled me down a lot. Every day I am sitting on the computer and watching blank screen. I just cannot push my self to do something. Me and my friends were smoking weed year ago, that was only time, when my mind was empty. But there were some side effects and my mum. Few mouths ago I tried killing myself with high electricity, but I ended up in in agony of pain and fell down and that saved me. So now I do not know what to do and how to plan my future, if I should just try killing myself on an ""accident"" once again so my family would not think that I had depression or ony mental disorder.

I hate that I am this weak. I want help but every time I ask everyone calls me weak. The friends I thought I had finally told me I am useless, even my coach told me that I would not amount to anything. I need help. I lost my will to live, I am so tired.",1

The people that I end up vibing with either are not interested back or my depression gets in the way of things and I cannot notice until its too late. I do not know if I have bad Karma or what but I cannot seem to catch a break socially. Every here and again I think back to only real friend I ever had which was in high school and about all the things we did together and what I possibly could have done to have had our friendship not come to an end. This is the first time in over 2 years that I have gotten crippling depression just thinking about it. It feels pretty pathetic that its been 5 years and I cannot get over something that ended in high school but I guess it is what it is. I have not had a real friend since 16",0

"I got really ""triggered"" today (I do not know if that is the right word, I guess I just mean extremely emotionally disturbed) by an article I read about how bad violence gets in prisons. How can people do such horrible things, and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all, it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soul-shattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through, and everytime I get ""triggered"" like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me. I do not know how to get it out of my head other than to off myself. There is so much unimaginable suffering (TW violence, sexual assault, animal abuse)",0

I know I am not but whining about it on a forum is not going to help, yet here I am. I do not even have fucking friends, all I have is people on a server. They do not even care for me, they care for a username. I wish there was just a button to press to die. I with there was a bus or train to stand in front of. I wish I had a gun to go out in a painless way. But no, I do not have any of that stuff. I have a box cutter and a pocket knife. I keep pressing it against my skin but I am not man enough to break. I am a pussy. I am not strong",1
"I woke up this morning and was getting ready to help clean that house but before I finish what I am doing in that bathroom I get screamed at for ""not cleaning"". I do my best to keep up but even ""simple"" things like sweeping can be overwhelming so I try to break it up but that is not good enough and equates to ""I do not clean ever"". Then I get called immature for limiting how much I speak while getting yelled at screamed at. But I guess it is ok since they apologized for the first round of yelling to yell some more about the same thing. I do not know why I just did not kill myself if I am such a burden to the people around me. No matter what I am not enough and I never will be. So I just got yelled at",0
"I am so tired of feeling stuck. Everyone in my life is moving on and is just so happy whenever I talk to them. New opportunities, people that adore them, etc. I just feel worthless.

I hate myself so much and I feel so guilty and I know I am just hurting them. I have told my gf this and idk what is happening. So my gf went on a trip and I was ok I did not talk to anyone or nothing and this is the first time any of this has happened someone help. So this girl texts me and originally I wanted to be friends but the last message I sent to her I asked for stuff and I felt so guilt right after that I blocked her. I told my gf and I know that I am just hurting them at this point I am only eating once a day and stopped being my self please someone give some advice or feedback or something. I am probably the worst bf in the world,0
"I spent over a week working on my final project for art , and it was literally hell and the end result was not even the best but i did not care because fuck it i wasted so much time doing this subject. Some stuff for it was falling apart so i just wanted to get help binding, keep in mind I just wanted to get help binding the night before it was due and my aunt my fucking aunt and my mother did nothing but criticise my project when I literally never speak to them because i cannot stand most of my family either way, and apparently my father was dissapointed because he could not help me bind it because he is ill, and my fucking aunt literally told me to start the whole fucking project over because she wanted him to feel better. I am not joking , she asked me to do over like two weeks worth of work in ONE NIGHT and then fucking gaslighted me when I said no are they fucking serious I was so close to just throwing myself out the fucking window right there i fuckinwgssnsnsjs. I binded it my self and sent it to skl but my god I am still reeling she cannot be serious SEETHING I am FUCKING SEETHING",1

"When I was 13 or 14, I was bullied in our class. These bullies called me names and physically intimidate me. I had a melt down once in our house, my parents were confused. I told them everything its like for them, my problem was not a big deal at all. That was when I start to emotionally (not totally) shutdown my self to my family. I have never speak about my emotional problems to them ever. Now that I am 24, all that suppressed emotions bite me in my ass now. I do not know if I have depression, anxiety or panic attack, but I am sure i was suffering their symptoms. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything so blurry. I cannot focus to my job. I cannot enjoy the things that I used to enjoy. My sleeping condition is getting worst as the time passed by. I just feel like I am sinking in a quick sand. I just want some advice on how to cope with this condition. I cannot continue my life with this. I cannot speak this to anyone in my life. I am too afraid. I need help. Wanting to speak about my depression but also being afraid to speak about it.",0
"I got covid around 6-7 months ago. And I was so fucking happy ironically. I have always hoped Id get some type of illness/virus/disease that would kill me. And I thought Id finally got that. A way out that would not hurt my family or friends or make them disappointed. I was ridiculously unhealthy at the time when I got it, smoking 2 packs a day, drinking copious amount of coffee, barely getting any sleep, diet did not exist etc. And all covid fucking did to me was give me a headache, sore glands, a little cough, make me lose smell and taste. And then I got better in like 3 days. Fuck this stupid deadly fucking virus. Fucking useless fuck. All I am left with now is long term symptoms that are helping to drive me closer to killing myself everyday. And I cannot kill myself because I am to much of a fucking coward. Every time I get into that mindset and convince myself to do it, I keep thinking of the pain my mom would go through, my dad, my friends, etc. It makes me feel fucking selfish. And the guilt I feel is even worse.But I cannot keep doing this, living this existence. I KNOW I am living for others. And I KNOW that will never change. I KNOW Ill never be strong enough to kill myself. here is to a futile existence of living for the sake of others. Fuck covid for not killing me",1
"I cannot stand this anymore. I am such a useless. Ppl around me do not want to know about my pain. They only want my grade or my performance. I do not know why I should exist in the toxic world, and I do not know why I have to live and why I should not leave now. I have ruined many things so I have to be punished. But no one seems to punish me so Ill punish myself. I do not even know why I am writing this rn.. It seems to be over",1
"I have been depressed/suicidal for the past year or so, but it got much worse this year. I have not been attending my online classes and lying to my mum about how university is going. The thing is that no one contacted me from the university to check up on me. The only time I received contact was for a missing assignment. I am scared because I know my mum will find out soon and get mad at me. All of my older siblings have been successful, but I have just been lying in bed on most days this year just wanting to end it. I have been trying to distract myself with video games and other stuff. Also, since my mum thinks everything is fine with me, she has been pressuring me to get a job. I am filled with anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I just want to run far far away. I am scared. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I have been reading all of the posts on the reddit since I discovered it and it helps to know that I am not alone in this world. And for that, I am thankful. Guess who has not been attending University for the past six months",1
"I guess if I do not need to buy food for a whole month I can afford next month's rent.I guess technically I can do that. I probably have enough to eat for a whole month.

If I eat half a packet a day that is almost all the days.I have some chicken, too.I have enough anti depressants for a month too.I do not know about next month. But if I can afford rent again. I will be out of food and pills. So what is the point of an apartment? My rent is paid",1
"Told a bunch of my friends, messed around with a guy at one point, so disgusted with myself.

I have been mistreated and abused ever since I was 3 and it hurts but I have just gotten used to it.I have had four suicide attempts and they all failed miserably, it is kind of embarrassing. I have been suicidal and depressed for as long as I can remember. I really want to attempt again but I am kind of scared it will go wrong again.before anyone says oh get help or talk to someone, I did and they never took me seriously or even tried to care. I just want to d!e already",1
I keep having these repetitive suicidal thoughts but I have no desire to act on them. I am not sure what to do about these since I have dealt with suicidal thoughts when I have dealt with depression and OCD but not solely on their own. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Any advice? Suicidal thoughts without depression,1
"TWI know how conditional love is, but it still hurts every time. I have a mental illness and people do not understand it. People think I will ""get better"" and then get my life together. No, it is going to be like this until I am dead. This is my emotional range, my emotional capacity. I am thinking of ending things again. I am quitting my job because my mental health blew up. When people say they did not see the signs, I wonder if they were blind. I was in a severe mental crisis and my psychiatrist recommended leave - since I know this company will just kick me out, I will just resign. I have not told them yet, I am just trying to regain some strength after having a full on meltdown that led to panic attacks and a near visit to the psych ward.I already attempted suicide once. It was my stepdad and my mom who drove me to the hospital. He was present. All of my family was so supportive afterwards.I guess time fades support. it is been now 3 years since. I have never stopped wanting to kill myself. The only, only reason I have not is my mom. Because I know it would destroy her. So I told myself I would handle anything, any hell that came my way for her. But knowing that my stepfather, who witnessed my attempt, who ""celebrates my second birth"" each year on the date, is now thinking I resign because I am attention seeking is just driving me to a point of no return.Hell, he even saw the cuts in my arm when I came clean about self-harming some weeks ago. What signal do humans need, exactly? Are they blind?They will be back home tomorrow. it is dangerous to be alone. I have every tool at my disposal. I did not really want to go with pills, but right now I am so sad because of his reaction that I am thinking what is the point. what is the point anymore. I am thinking of why does he lie to me. Why does he tell me he thinks of me as his daughter, after 20 years, when I know it is a lie. it is a damn lie, he cares about me just as much as my actual dad does. His feelings are always more important than mine. He has a 32 year old daughter who has not worked a day in her life, a son my age who has not worked a day in his life. I have been spending every year since 18 destroying my mental health to try to gain financial independence. To try to prove somehow that I can, but I cannot. I actually cannot. I enter a job and I try my hardest, and it becomes hell - and I try to stand it, and my health goes in a downward spiral every time. People only believe you when it is too late.I am struggling a lot right now because I promised my psych and my mom I would give a warning if I wanted to kil myself. I want to kill myself. I guess he would believe me then. The weight of the disappointment of others",1

"I get this constant nagging feeling that I am just born wrong, or something about myself makes me the least interesting person to exist. I feel invisible. I feel lost. I feel unmotivated. I feel extremely lonely with no one to express or confide in. Despite how creative I try to be or how much I try to learn, I keep failing and keep getting increasingly brain-dead. Despite how thankful I try to be with what I have in life, I do not feel happy, fulfilled, or satisfied. My goals and purpose are dissolving. I feel unnoticed and unguided. I constantly imagine myself being shunned when I reach out. I feel detached, and completely helpless. I wanted to grow and always stand apart from those around me. I have always wanted to become the most interesting person in a room. I thrive on social life and love people and try to be my best version amongst people. I try to look my best without forcing myself to be conventional. I try my best, yet I get miserably opposite results. I try my best, yet am able to attract nothing. I feel extremely lonely and un-purposeful. I do not want to live, I am tired of it all. I feel like shit, with no one to talk to. I feel like giving up.",0

"Hey, so I have been having a really rough couple of months, and I think I have messed up my life really badly. I had a lot of really good friends at my college and we were all super tight not. I was dating my girlfriend for about 9 months and over the last couple of months I really messed everything up. I have been continuously pushing her away in all types of ways such as: having little to no sex drive because I have had no ability to even think about that, I have been isolating myself and not communicating what I have been going through well, and I just have not wanted to go on dates. None of this is why she said she wanted to break up though, she wanted to break up because I have not been able to make myself talk to her or communicate while we are back from school. She said I have a lot I need to work on and that she does too.Anyway I agree with her and I know I should not be in a relationship right now but I love her so much and want to be with her so bad, so this is not a post where I want you guys to say we should not be together right now because I know this. I think we will eventually get back together if she can see I grew up. I do not want to work on myself for her to take me back but that would be a positive.I guess me making this post is to ask how have you guys been able to work on yourself and what are some methods I can use to improve my mental stability, and also how have you been able to refind yourself when you have no clue who you are anymore? (P.S) I have been on medication before but stopped taking it because it was making me sadder (it was Prozac) I might try medicine again but we shall see. Anyway sorry for the long post just kind of a brain dump. Depressive Episode",0

"I cannot live with my anxiety anymore, I cannot handle it.. not in a life like this, I just hope if there is something after this life it will be more kind to me then this life was, everything I have had to go through in my life has lead to nothing but more suffering, more pain. it is a cruel fucking random game life is. I do not see any reason to live anymore, nobody In my house listens to me, I guess talking to me about literally fucking ANYTHING is the most difficult thing ever, every. GOD DAMN. THING. yet they can criticize me however they want, I am lazy, I am Ignorant, I am negative, I am crazy.. fucking assholes. some people were not meant to be fucking parents, I will tell you that right now.. sharing anything with them is like talking to a god damn brick wall, my entire life you have just yelled at me and never pushed me to do anything out of my comfort zone. Now because of that I am, just useless... that is all I will ever be,I do not have any friends either, nobody who gives a fuck enough to listen to me anyways, which Is fine. I do not expect anyone to be friends with a mentally ill depressed awkward fucking retard tbh, if I was in their shoes I would probably do the same, so no hard feelings there :) part of me feels bad for doing this now considering what just happened in my mom's family 4 days ago.. I wish I could push myself to stay a little longer and did not have to put her through losing someone else, but I do not think I would be able to help her anyway.. I feel like putting her through this now instead of later when she just started healing would be less-cruel, but I do not know.. I just hope my dad will be able to help her through this, but I cannot continue, I do not want to continue.. I do not want to waste so much pointless fucking energy just to grow old and die alone, I do not want to continue living In a fucking awful home filled with people who do not even acknowledge me, I do not want to continue being alone while everyone around me has some connection to something or someone... so, I am done.

"Hi all,I posted the following on r/advice too. I am not sure how to cross post from my phone. Scroll down for the TLDR. Thanks!I am looking for some advice. My late-30s brother is going through a bad break up and maybe an early midlife-crisis at the moment, and I want to help him somehow. The problem is hes making it difficult. Hes acting like an absolutely reckless, self-absorbed, mean, superficial, posturing asshole.Hes very successful professionally, but his personal life is a mess. This and what follows probably sounds judgy, but i love him dearly and I am worried about his safety.We have a history of bipolar disorder in my family. Right now, hes fixated on having a bunch of random, unprotected sex, aggressively driving his car and motorcycles, partying, etc. You get the picture. Hes really focused on appearance, his own and everyone elses who do not meet his criteria (family not excluded). And the other day he casually said that he could die tomorrow and it would not matter.All of his family, including me, live in other parts of the country. He hangs out with a new batch of partying, just as reckless early-20s friends every few months, so no one he has history or strong friendships with. He hasong-term friends, but they are not really in tough. They all have families now which is not really conducive to his lifestyle. I feel like there is no one in his life who is looking out for him or calling him on his behavior.I have been trying to talk to him as much as I can, but it does not seem to be helping. I have suggested he see a therapist I have gotten a lot out of therapy myself but he thinks he can figure things out on his own.To be clear, there is nothing wrong with having lots of sex or caring what you look like. Its just on the extreme end of things and I feel like its only a matter of time before something bad happens. For what its worth, hes generally an intelligent, responsible, clear-headed, funny, charming, and romantic person.Does anyone have experience with a similar situation?TLDR: How can I help a depressed brother who refuses help and is pushing everyone who cares about him away? Suggestions for helping my brother?",0
"being an adult is so fucking lonely. everyone is busy with their own lives, i do not know how to reach out when I am feeling like i cannot do this anymore. and i do not think i can do this anymore. i do not feel like i matter to any of my friends. i know they *care* about me and all that, but in a background way where they all have their own lives without me in it. it feels so fucking lonely. i have no one to share my pain with like i used to. friends are still friends but not we hardly see each other due to living in different places with different work/university schedules. i have no one to remind me i matter to them like i used to. i just have to watch them all live their own lives through social media which is even more isolating and painful. i wish i had constant social interaction/validation like i did back in high school/college. without i fee so empty and alone. being an adult is painfully lonely",1

"**TW: suicide**Its currently 6am and I cannot sleep. Its 6am and have not gone to sleep yet. I am too overwhelmed too sleep.I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for diagnostic evaluation, in a couple weeks. My summer break is over a few days after my appointment and I am panicking. I am not ready to go back to school yet. I need a diagnosis before I go back, I literally cannot function, everyday of my life is living hell and I cannot take it anymore. My parents will not let me get vaccinated for covid and I do not want to go back to school where most everyone is not vaccinated. I am really worried for my appointment with the psychiatrist. I am worried that I will not be diagnosed on the first appointment and Ill have to go back to school without meds not knowing what is wrong with me.Last year, I failed most of my classes and I really do not want to retake my failed classes at irl school because I am too embarrassed to let everyone know that I am failing. My pediatrician recommended that I get a tutor and a 504. I have already have a 504 plan but my parents and I know nothing about it so its doing nothing to help me. I am too embarrassed to get a tutor because I do not want to feel stupid in front of a tutor if I do not know something.I am having a really bad time right now and I am so tired but not like sleepy tired, I am just so tired of feeling like shit everyday and not being understood. I feel like I am going crazy. I am not planning on killing myself or anything, I just wish there was nothingness. Everyday I get worse though, everyday I get more and more sick of everything and want to say fuck it.

Silly is all I fucking am. it is all this stupid low IQ post from a low IQ dumbass is. I do not know what the fuck I am even looking for anymore, absolutely fucking nothing makes me happy not even self harming because I just know everything I do is completely fucking pointless. I am a blistering sore on everyone around me I know all I do is bring forth negativity and yet I cannot even rid them of me because for some damn reason I think at least someone in my family will grieve for me.

My family is living happy since they do not have to worry about because I am such a burden and all I do is get in the way of them trying to live their life, even though I am so unproblematic that I choose to suffer in silence so I do not bother anybody.

"The level of self delusion that exists within humans is breathtaking. As in I literally need to force myself to breathe when interacting with the astoundingly average individuals that aspire to positions of authority.""exercise reduces anxiety"" no you bumbling baffoon, exercise reduces stress. Anxiety is a complex neurological condition that requires synaptic rewiring to ""reduce"" . When anxiety binds one to bed for two weeks straight because the emotional overwhelm at the mere thought of having to interact a world designed to destroy the last remnants of my sanity then ""going for a walk"" becomes a much greater ordeal than your privileged pig-headed personage can possibly predict.How the fuck did such mediocre minds earn the right to dictate and define what passes for passable knowledge?Why is the ego of a professor is worth more than the wealth of knowledge, the discovery of new ideas, the challenge of defending the old ways of thinking in the light of new information? Madness.The most galling part is the history of humanity is literally littered with these same mistakes. Doctors now wash their hands because of a colleague who they had committed to an asylum because his notions were too absurd to be worth more than mockery. By what right does this tradition of abject arrogance continue? Why must we destroy those simply trying to prevent destruction? Fuck people. Fuck society. Fuck every corruption inflicted upon this world by the ignorant and greedy.God, let me be at peace. Please. I have had enough of this.

"I am sick of attempting to please people's expectations. I am over the cycle of society. All the emotions that we can feel are simply a scientific reaction, so who cares about love? I do not want children either, but if I do not have them then people will judge me. I believe in God... I think? I do not know anymore. Everything seems to be a distraction from the truth of reality. Once we erase money, entertainment, buildings, all human-made creations, then we will have nothing. But did we ever have anything? It was always nothing but comfort for our minds.I am sick of ableism, racism, sexism, etc. Why cannot we just forget what happened in the past and think about the future of humankind? we are always behaving like God, judging others as if our opinions matter. Judging each other's appearances, intelligence, and social behaviours. But what is the point of it? People judge others so they feel better about themselves.Life is pointless to me. We graduate from school to find a job, use their deserved money to purchase gifts for themselves, but the items will never be truly theirs. One day, everyone who is reading this post will die. Then someone will take their items, whether they are from their family or another. Some will sell their treasures while others will keep them for themselves. But none will love the items as much as you do. Your items will soon be recycled or forgotten. Dreams are much better. That is because society does not exist within our dreams. would not it be better if we dreamt forever once we die? I wish for that to happen to me. I will never get sick of them. I want to dream forever",1
"Hi,I am in a rough place right now with no one to turn to, so here is hoping typing it out will make a difference.A bit of background: I am nearly 30, and I suffer from anxiety and depression. My natural response to my anxiety is getting lost in my computer - games, movies, Reddit.. When I am distracted I am not anxious. So I isolate myself. As the anxiety creeps closer, I close off to the world. I spend all my waking hours in front of my computer. I do not go out, not even to shop. Isolation and depression are the best of friends, so any motivation to do even the simplest stuff goes out the window. I do not cook. I order junk food, because cooking is too much. So I sit on my ass and get fatter, hating myself more and more, knowing I am in a vicious cycle, but feeling absolutely powerless to help it.Now, I know the last 18 months have been crazy, but I would have isolated myself nonetheless. So, things are not going great, but last week they went from bad to worse. I became homeless. I saw it coming, but sadly my area has a bit of a housing crisis. I could not even get a spot at a homeless shelter.So, as you might imagine, being homeless with crippling anxiety and depression, having only been outside twice the last 18 months, that was a bit rough.Luckily I managed to secure a couch, but having no family and with friendships having been neglected, due to my isolation, it was a very close call on me sleeping on the streets.Today, I got my new apartment. 250km from everyone and everything I have ever known. Unable to yet secure transport for my stuff, I am sitting on the floor writing this and I will be sleeping on the floor for the next while.Reality has caught up to me and hit me like a ton of bricks. As I am sitting here on the floor contemplating just how much I fucked up my life, it all feels a bit hopeless. It is so hard not to have a single person in your life that you can rely on.So here I sit all alone. Feeling like the biggest loser in the world and without even a bed to crawl into and try to forget my problems. What do normal people do when they get this sad?",0

However a few days after I go out with a guy for school ,which I did not like, so I could get some experience go out with guys and I ended up getting sexually assaulted I am glad he did not rape me you was so sacred that he would but I still haunts me 1 mounts later because I feel him on me. So as my mental health was already shit its even shitter now. Well I got sexually assaulted",0
"My GF of 6 years and mother of my child cheated one me(now ex). She is constantly lying into my face and has brought our kid to her lover several times despite agreeing on waiting a year before doing so. For the sake of the child. I have also always been there for her when she went through depression, and she responds to that by cheating and showing me she does not give a shit about me. I have had enough. I see no future, I have debt that only i know about. I have no will to work, live, or exist. I see no brighter tomorrow, or a brighter future.I am going to suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. I have figured out how, and I have got my letter ready. I currently live at my parents because our house is not sold yet, so I am sneaking out when they are asleep and finally putting an end to all of this. I want to stay alive for my daughter but I cannot take it anymore. I have made up my mind. I wish you all the best, and I hope those of you that struggle can get through the pain.

"So I met this girl on tinder 1 1/2 years . We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music , gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself; nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry , heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence (her diary that she started when we first moved in) and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore . I just wanted to feel normal for once but I ended up feeling worse than when i started.Sorry for any misspelling and grammatical errors. My fwb/roommate betrayed me and claims I sexually assaulted her but I do not think I did, and I still love her. This caused me to lose my first apartment.help!",1
"I am sitting here, about to kill myself silently but I feel the need to tell someone before I go. So now here I am. But why am I like this? I do not want the people I care about to know but I feel like I have to tell someone if that makes sense? I am not thinking straight so I cannot understand. And I likely will not be able to respond to anyone as my phone will die just before me? What is wrong with me? Why am I so attention seeking?",1

"Okay so something suddenly, seriously suddenly, happened to me 2 nights ago. I was minding my own business, and was lying down, about to go to sleep, when a sudden felling and sensation of foreboding, as if I am going mad, sadness, came over me. It was so uncomfortable that I woke my paremts up, fearing that i would loose my mind and hurt them or myself.My parents are very supportive, and loving and i am the apple of their eyes. The feeling of foreboding did not go, and i continued to feel that sensation. My mom kept an arm around me, and I tried to sleep. I did sleep eventually, tho it was not great, but still, it was sleep.The next day i hoped i will feel okay, but then it did not go. Thoughts of wanting to harm myself came, when i literally do not have anything bad happening in my life, in fact, i was jolly and happy before the sensation. But i must say, that i was binge watching on crime vids on yt, where they discuss the criminal cases of people, and it did not affect me much, until the sudden feeling.Now, 2 days after the sensation, I no longer want to harm anyonez but yes, intrusive and poignant thoughts of arming myself are coming to me, and *do not* want to act on them. When I do not try to think about them, I am alright, but when I do, these symptoms come:Wanting to kill myself (i visibly try to shove this thought as i have no reason to do this)DiarrhoeaIncreased heart rateSomething, body shakingWanting to sleep a lot (which i like to avoid as then the depressing thoughts come back)Not wanting to speak muchUnable to concentrate/distract myselfI think i need professional help, but its too costly i guess i should speak to my fam about this, who have been very supportive of me. They will understand and try to help me. But if a psychologist or therapist here can please give me some advise on what to do, i would be very grateful.Peace and love. Is this a sudden depressive attack?",0

"alright, so first i have to admit that my biggest need in life is to feel loved. not just loved, but to have someone that finds me attractive and is turned on by me and my body. including my penis. now, when i was younger. say, teen and young adult. i really did not care too much about my penis size. sure i would be a bit embarressed by it and was always one to hold off on sexual activities until i had been with a girl for a little while. but it did not because depression. I am in my 30's now and my life experiances has taken me from thinking ""size is not everything"" to litterally crying more often then i would like to admit over my penis size. I am a grower first off. and at full staff its not too bad i guess. below average but not micro by any means. but soft its less then an inch for sure. in fact. when I am sitting down its litterally inside me. anyway. because of this i have never been much for one night stands or to go around having sex with lots of woman. with the exeption of twice in my life, i have just been a long term relationship type. i have had 4 previous relationships (one was marriage for almost 10 years). and i am on my 5th currently. all 4 of those, i was cheated on. multiple times. my ex wife i had even found that she was telling the other guys that i was small and she did not get turned on my it. taking something i was already a little self consious about, and adding in that EVERY girlfriend i have had has cheated on me. i am now VERY needy in terms of exeptence of my penis size. my current relationship, we have sex once or twice a month and that is it. she says she is just not a very sexual person. but see, we were friends before we started dating and, she used to talk about loving to give blowjobs, and she even had a FWB just because she loved giving them so much she had someone she could just go suck any time she wanted. so i cannot help but feel like its me. like i have an underwelling penis that just does not get her going. my life at this point revolves around my self loathing over my penis size. I feel like the ONE thing i need more then anything i can never have because no girl gets excited about small penis'. the best i hear is woman that say they do not mind it. or that it does not matter to them. but i clearly have never even found that. i do love my current girlfriend and she is good to me any many non sexual ways. and i feel i cannot give my true feelings to her because that might seem like guilt tripping and when it comes to sex, guilt tripping someone, in many ways, is a bit..... well... i cannot think of the word so i will use an example. a guy that guilts a woman into sex because she gave him blue balls would be considered a pig right? so i feel like if i talked about this with her it would be similar. like..... oh you should have sex with me more because i need to feel like my penis size is ok.... i just cannot do that. i do not feel right about it. even if i know in my head that is not my reason. in my head I am not doing it as a guilt trip. that is still kind of too close to the same category. so i sit here. so damned depressed that i cannot even ""take care of myself"" when i feel the urge sometimes. i feel sad and like i will never feel truly loved and desired. you know, let us talk about porn for a moment. i am not one to use it when i am in a relationship. but i had a few years between my ex and my current girl to have watched a bit and really dig around to see what is out there. and i am starting to cave a bit and use it from time to time just because of how in frequent we have sex. but the point of bringing up porn is this.... there is fetishes for basically everything. feet fetishes. old people. fat people. short people. tall people. big boobs. small boobs. ect ect. i mean the list is endless. but you know what i cannot find? a porn fetish catagory for woman that like small dicks. you can find a fetish for woman that like to be pee'd on and deficated on. but not that like small penis'. in fact. the only small penis fetish i can find is HUMILIATION. which is the LAST thing i want to see and just know that its out there depresses me even more. its depressing to think that every woman i have ever been with has been so displeased by it that they decided to go find a bigger one to play with on the side. i tried anonymous video sites a few times when i was single and that left me crying every time. you find a girl that wants to cam with you. and as soon as she see's what i am working with, she either clicks off immediatly, or she stays to laugh and call it small. there was one time that i thought that maybe witholding the information that i had a small dick until the relationship was a few weeks old (or more) was my problem. so when i was talking to this one girl, i waiting for her to bring up sex in the conversation and when she finally did, i informed her i was small. she asked for a picture so i sent her one. she litterally just stopped replying. never heard from her again. like. i genuinly feel like maybe they feel like they have been scammed or something. start a relationship with me. i seem like a good boyfriend. and then bam. small dick. i do not know what to do. i know i should not put so much into my penis size. but my life experiances has caused this and i can no longer convince myself its ok. i can no longer believe size does not matter. or its the motion of the ocean. or that looks are not everything. or that you can make up for it in bed with other things like mouth skills and so on. i just want someone to genuinly like my penis. and i will never have that. small ""member"" causing major depression",0
"It seems like I have woken up today, knowing and thinking about myself in full clarity. I am sitting at my desk thinking about the mistakes I have made at just 25 and I feel calm and scared and lost. Everything that has lead me here has been my fault, I have been manipulative as a second language and hurt the people who meant everything to me. My marriage failed because I held on to tight to her when she needed me to let go and now there is no words to say to apologize or take back the pain I caused by suffocating her and then eventually cheating on her. But she still crosses my mind everyday. Even the relationship I tried to do everything right in failed because I am inherently bad as a person. I was gaslighting you without even knowing it and I made you miserable to the point you had to fight the air in your lungs to get away, and ill never know how to make that right by you. But I hope someday you will forgive me.Even when I joined the navy to have some sense of normalcy and life, I messed that up and left with a little more in pocket than I meant to. Now I stay awake at night suffocating from the memories of almost dying and hope for the morning light to bring me life, but every part of me knows that if I had not been in that situation I would not be here in pain now. I am a terrible person and I know I do not deserve happiness or life. But I am calm knowing that and I am calm knowing that everything has to end. Somehow in the lowest I have ever felt I am also the calmest I have ever felt. For anyone who takes the time to read this. Thank you. Everything has to end",0

"I just turn 18 and i have been a NEET for like 5 years, i have like a lot of mental problems so that make me unable to start conversations, paying attention, i have anxiety crises and i have depression and because of that i just have like 2 friends that i barely talk to them and I cannot have a job because of that many problems.My parents do not understand when i say that i have all this problems they just think I am shy and a stupid, and always tries to make me have a job or start studying but I am unable to, i try my best but i cannot, and it really brings me down when i do my best, but my best is never enough.My Brother was always the favorite from my family, he have everything he want has good grades and a lot of friends, people always compare me to him, I am likes his shadow, he had depression for a while, and my family did everything to help him, and that is really good.But when i said they did not do nothing, and my mom even said:""Your problem is not that serious as your brother's problem, he really suffers, you are just complain because you just lock yourself in the bedroom and play videogames all day and do nothing, that is not depressed that is just laziness"".I am see myself crying a lot lately, my life is like a looping hell, i cannot do nothing, nobody help's me when i ask for help, even my parents, the only reason i do not kill myself it is because i have a little hope, i now if anything good happen to me will be enough to me to keep me living.But i have been waiting for this moments of happiness for like years now, it is really hard to keep on, and I do not know when this little hope that i have will go away, and I am really scared when this happens, i try to say to myself that this suicide thought is not worthy and life is good and precious but as the time goes it looks more like a lie or just a fantasy.(Sorry for any bad English it is not my main language) Everyday is the same looping hell and i feel like a pile of shit.",1
"To those who are reading this, you were some of the only good in my life. I send this to you because I want to thank you for everything you have done for me. it is not your fault. it is nobody's but mine, I caused so many problems for myself and clearly was not a good enough friend. I am sorry for everything I have done, but now you never again have to deal with me. :)It became too much, out of nowhere. I have been spiraling downwards in my mental state for a long time now, and I finally hit the last straw. Everyone I know will see this around 5:30, and by then I will already be dead. Coming out as trans was a big hit to my mental health. My relationships were all harmed to some extent, some of which were because of people being awkward with it, and others thanks to straight up transphobia. Overall, this has just made 2021 a very difficult year for me. But recently I did something that killed any self love I had left. I tried not starting conversations with my friends. Guess how many started one with me?? ZERO. No one likes me enough to even try to talk to me, to make plans, or anything of the sort. Yet somehow I pushed past that. I managed to start feeling alright with myself. I have taught myself to do that, because no one ever likes me so I try to like myself. But then I received a message that broke my heart. One of my best friends, and the person who is been the kindest and most caring to me, told me she no longer wanted to be friends. Realising I managed to fuck up one of the best relationships I have ever had made life unbearable. (Note that the person who broke off will not see this part)And that brings me to where I am now, sitting here trying to figure out how I will end it, and creating this note for you, to at least understand my pain. I am sorry for always being so annoying and stupid, but apparently it is just who I was. Thanks for being in my life. Could someone check over my suicide note and make sure it does not seem like it is blaming anyone? I do not want anyone to thinks it is their fault.",1

I am having a bad night and it feels like there is no end in sight..I wish I had people I could talk to there is nothing interesting about this,0
"it is just like last summer. As soon as school ended it started again. My mom is insane and I cannot stand it, she calls me all sorts of things for no reason and it is gotten to the point that I just do not care anymore. Last summer I felt the same, just because of final exams and my parents not being satisfied with what I am. I wanted to die then and I am starting to want to die now. The school year has been peaceful; starting highschool was ok, I guess, except for the fact that everyone thinks I am a loser. I kept to myself all year and now there is people in my class that think it is ok to treat me like shit, and if I say anything that pisses them off, ta-da, I am not taken seriously. It sucks.I had enough of my mom being fucking nasty, and my dad being an alcoholic that thinks we do not know he gambles tons of money away. If it had not been for my baby sister existing I definitely would have done it. I am so fucking sick of being called all sorts of things and not being able to say anything back. I cannot even defend myself or give my opinion. My whole family thinks I am good for nothing because I do not work my ass off in around the household like one of my cousins, but I see no reason to do so. I hate the countryside, I hate living here and I want to move to the city as soon as possible.Every day sucks: I wake up (or am waken up by my mom), drink coffee, and babysit my sister for the rest of the day. I cannot have free time, I have to be available at all times so my mom can chat with the neighbors and my dad can do jack shit all day because his goddamn tummy hurts. Maybe it would not hurt if he tried to smoke or drink less, but only he works in our household, so he ""can afford it"" by his own terms even though we barely have enough cash to make it through the day.Today I felt different though: After my mom got tired of screaming at me, I felt something almost snap inside of me. And I did not care anymore. I feel like I need to cry and scream at the same time, but I also just do not care about what is happening around me. I have felt this way before when thinking about suicide, I felt comfort. Ever since last summer the idea of dying seems comforting. Maybe it is my mind becoming used to it, or maybe it settled in that I might end up like that sooner than I think. I am not thinking of killing myself right now, but if this summer continues this way I might consider just chugging a bottle of pills and being done with it. Sorry for boring you out, I hope you can get back the time you spent reading this. See ya, kind stranger. I feel peaceful.",1
"I am 14, I am going into high school,I have not talked to anyone I know, and I hate everything about myself the year before. I make awful jokes, I was an idiot, I ruined everything. I have been really down lately.I do not know if its depression, I do not care if it is either. I have always had the idea of suicide in the back of my mind, but I have never been able to contemplate it, or imagine it, I am terrified. I have gained a ton of weight, I have lost a ton of sleep, I hate how I look, how I talk, everything. All I do is sit around and play video games, and eat, and sleep. My health is deteriorating and I do not have the motivation to change it. My lack of sleeps caused me to lose coordination, and now I have all these scars from falls, cuts from cans, shattered nails. I am losing my grasp on my dreams, my own reality. I am scared of my life, every aspect of it, and I try to cover that up. I put on a smile, and act like its all good, I feel happy, get home, and it all crashes in front of me. I am not proud of myself, and I do not know what to do. I am scared",1
"Over the past couple of years I have been suffering from loneliness. My immediate family who I live with were made aware of this by me after I admitted to them I had felt suicidal this was near the end of 2019.Fast-forward to now and although I spend most of my time with my immediate family which helps me out I still suffer strongly from loneliness as I only have one friend who tends to be busy, but we hang out occasionally.I have a deep desire for a deep and meaningful connection, someone I can call a close friend who I can trust, and also a partner I can spend time with.This loneliness is emotionally damaging to me as I am seeing an abundance of content online on TV, YouTube, etc., where people are happy with their friends and/or partners, and here I am wanting someone to call a friend or partner, to be happy.I am trying to meet new people but I cannot find any meet-up groups of young people like myself who share my interests. I will not open up to my family due to feeling a sense of being pathetic, embarrassed for my lack of social life, and because I do not want their pity or to be treated differently.I just feel stuck and hopeless now, and this drives my thoughts of suicide and misery.All I want is someone to talk to that is not my family, but I also feel like my feelings are not valid because I have not tried everything. Loneliness is emotionally painful",0
"sometimes I just have to wonder why we live. If we all die in the end and do not remember anything, why live? Nobody is going to remember you because were all going to die, so why does it matter so much that we have to live and keep going. Were tiny organisms in this big universe, so why? People always say hey do not do it! its not worth it! Then what is worth it? does our existence really matter? Is anyone really going to care if you die? are strangers or people on the internet really going to go out of their way to cry for you? what is the point in our society? Spending over a decade in the education system, only to go out and live a mundane life everyday, and then die. Is living even worth it? Why do we live",1
"I(22M) live with my mother. She has sacrificed a lot for me but she has been very toxic for me(keeps shouting on me and throws things when angry, does not let me have my privacy) which has made me frustrated. I want to move out but I get depressed if I am alone for long, which gets me to the point of being suicidal. I have tried this before so I know where it can get me. So I asked my bf to move in with me but he denied giving some lame reason, and said that we will live together later. He visits me whenever I have a big break down(in a month or so) but I want to have some solution for my situation, I do not want to have big depressive episodes time and again. it is hampering my career. I do not have any friends and even if I tell someone, they just ignore it and say things like: ""do not be depressed, I know it is hard"". Honestly, I feel lifeless now and just want to be away from everyone, since it feels like no one wants to actually help. I do not know what to do in order to uplift my spirits. I break down after every 10-11 days and cannot put up with the toxic environment. Maybe I am wrong to expect things from people. I was hurt the most by my bf's reaction but I know I am wrong to expect since it is a big thing to ask for. Unable to get out of toxic environment.",0
"I am in my mid twenties and ever since I am 13, my biggest dream was to have my own family one day. To find a great husband, get pregnant and have kids, be housewife for a while and raise the kids with all my love.I come from an abusive household (still am in there, long story) and never experienced a real family, I literally start crying whenever I see or hear other people talk about theirs. I am so miserableToday at work the realisation that I will die lonely dawned upon me. It feels like I am cursed just like my depressed sibling who is in their early thirties and also has the same faith like me.I am doing great at school and work but I do not care at all for this stuff. I do not want to become 30 or 40 years old with a great job, Id rather have the family life that I now realise I will never have. I am not asking for any advice or good words, I just needed to get this out and see if someone else feels like me even though I do not want to live, never wanted to, I am not going to kill myself and just suffer and be miserable every day. I am going to stop doing my makeup or skincare or dress well and just exist I do not want to live anymore after realizing Ill never have my own family",0

"it is honestly the worst feeling in the world have the one person you care about and love the most tell you they hate you.. yeah I know I have fucked up but I am doing everything I can to change for her.. the night she told me that I got up out of bed, went to the backyard. Found some good strong and long rope and set off into the darkness.. as I was preparing for my departure she comes and finds me, taking my escape with her.. after this she goes back inside.. that is when I went too look for another escape route.. ended up finding some old ratchet straps and set off once again, this time to the horse trailer.. I tied up a half assed noose and pit it around my neck and sat down..as I feel myself drifting off into the darkness I hear her call out to me with a worried tone.. that is when I thought to myself, maybe she does still care about me, maybe I can keep on living.. that was almost my final goodbye and at times I wish it was.. but no.. instead I stood up and removed the strap from around my neck and just sat there crying to myself.. she ended up finding me saying I could come back inside.. that was 3 nights ago.. and she still will not sleep in the same bed as me, say ""I love you"" , call me babe, hug me, kiss me.. nothing.. I feel like a stranger in my own home.. and I do not know if I can keep going on like this.. I have promised myself that if one more thing happens then that is it for me.. I hate to say it but I am serious.. I do not want a life that does not have her in it.. I just wish she could know that before it is too late.. My own wife does not even want me anymore..",1

"this may sound dumb, but i miss feeling sad. when i felt sad i felt more of a drive to try do something about it. now i just feel nothing, the days just go by and seem as useless as the last no matter what i end up doing. i spend all of my time trying to just get time to pass. for what i do not know i have nothing to look forward to. i then start feeling like I am just wasting my fucking time. any effort i put ends up being a reminder that i cannot enjoy anything, which makes me want to not try and the cycle continues. i used to be able to handle my sadness much better when it was more obvious that was how i was feeling, I would be creative and be more willing to fight against it to get better. nowadays its just doing whatever takes the smallest amount of effort just enough to keep me occupied. i feel like I am letting people around me down, and I am digging myself a deeper hole.i can see myself already regretting all this wasted time if i manage to get out of this, but i honestly feel like there is nothing i can do about it. wasting time",0

"Almost a year ago the company I work at shut down the building and moved everyone to working remotely. I was hesitant about it then and at this point I am just completely falling apart. My workspace is just feet from where I sleep at night (and it has to be there). I wake up in the morning next to my sleeping wife, roll out of bed, put on a pair of shorts, and clock in for the day. I do not get to see any of the friends I made at the office. I do not get to talk shit about corporate over a cup of coffee. I do not get to take a slow drive at night before I get home and destress myself before I get home. I am spiraling into a deep depression, my work stats are falling tremendously, and my attendance is flatlining but I do not feel I have any other options. Two+ years ago I was a career factory worker, working with high school friends at the local cheese factory, and I loved it. But it ended suddenly when I was in a life changing car accident and shattered half of my spine. I could no longer do any sort of labor/standing work and had to move to the city to find a desk job. The company I worked at was the only one who would hire a crippled factory worker with no customer service experience at the age of 20. They provided me with an orthapedic chair, a comfortable job, and secure source of income. Working in the building also gave me the social interaction I needed to make new friends here in a city I would never seen before. But then covid happened. Well over half our workforce jumped on the chance to work from home rather than on site but more than a few of us wanted to remain in the office and so we did, until corporate decided for us. They decided it was no-longer financially viable to keep the office building open and announced we had a month to vacate and be set up to work from our homes. So I moved all my stuff onto a cart and shoved it into the back of my Volkswagen. I got it home, put it on an old desk I had left in storage, set up some filing cabinets, and put my usual desk toys on it. At first I was enjoying amenities readily available to me by being in my own house. I knew the bathroom would be empty anytime I needed it, I could brew my own pot of coffee, and I have shelves and a fridge with snacks and meals loaded up in them. If I got to bored I could play with my dogs or turn on the TV behind me and play my old Xbox 360 on mute. But I knew it was lacking something major. No longer could I take off my headset and go storm outside after a shitty customer encounter and vent to a coworker doing the same while sucking down 3 cigarettes in record time. I could not take my foam football and play catch with my cubicle neighbors anymore. I could not start up a conversation with my boss where we picked apart all the issues we had with ""The Hobbit"" movies. We could not leave fun little surprises on each others desks, company Christmas was dead forever, and we no longer would share a meal together in the cafeteria on Thanksgiving. I just finally made a single friend outside of work but I cannot force myself into his space constantly, he has 2 kids and a wife to take care of first. I cannot go to the gym and burn off energy because I will physically hurt myself, I cannot go wander in any direction with a .22 and hunt for small game in a city, and I cannot go fishing in any of the commercial use waterways around me. I feel so alone, I feel like I no longer have a bedroom but instead an office space that I sleep in. My physical health is being affected even, I am getting sick more often, my body hurts more than normal, and I just never feel like I am fully awake anymore. I do not really know what help to ask for if I am being completely honest. Can anyone offer some advice, or emotional support, or even share some experience that can help me through this?

"Things have already been pretty bad and somehow they took a turn for the worse. I feel entirely isolated, even though I have some family around and a few friends I talk to every once in awhile. I do not know if the isolation has driven me further down my rabbit hole, or if this would be happening regardless of who I am around. I cannot control my mood in any capacity, and in the hour or two of a break I get from the crushing despair and chaos in my head, Ill try to actively stay in the wildly overly positive state because at least its positive. But its almost as if trying to stay there just makes me return to that chaotic world I have created in my head. I do not know when I started living life inside my head instead of participating in the life in front of me, and I am scared that Ill never be able to make it stop. And I am getting to the point of not being able to take it anymore. I am sorry if that did not makes sense. I am sorry for burdening yet another social platform with my disaster. It gets worse before it gets worse",0

"like any other post in this subreddit, I am going to share my very short story. do not know if this is depression but i just want to let it out and organize my thoughts. I am 13 so my family kind of just ignores it calls it part of adolescence and hey i guess that is true. but it is been so painful i really need to let it out and i hope that it will go away as i grow old (or learn to hide it i guess).a few weeks ago i stopped ignoring my scoliosis. i researched about it and hey, it is incurable. i have to live with it until i die. haha. unless i get a surgery, which is not really the best choice, maybe even the last option due to the nature of the surgery being literally fusing your spine into one stiff bone. i was very shaken up which broke me. i started blaming myself. i feel bad for my mom. she had me when she was just 22. she was forced to marry my dad which is like 32 at that time. she was cheated on and my dad left us when i was 3. because of that, until now my mom cannot have another husband. she cannot quit her job where she is treated as shit. now she have a daughter who has a disgusting spine. she is so strong. i feel so worthless and guilty of her suffering. maybe right now if she did not have me she would not have married my dad. maybe right now she married her ex-boyfriend (he left her because she cannot marry him because she is still considered married). i feel like everything that is happened to her is my fault. then i started thinking, what if i stopped existing or what if i killed myself. will she be happy? i was shocked. I am still 13. why am i thinking like this. i hate myself for thinking like this. i cannot even tell this to my family because they will think it is just normal or I am sick in the head. I have fantasised using a knife to stab myself or when I am in a car just getting in an accident. i do not want to think like this. my story is pretty mild compared to others so i feel guilty thinking like this. i feel like i have no right to feel like this because I am young and it is not worse compared to others.that is all haha. i did not want to dampen your mood or make you annoyed thinking ""why is she like this it is just hormones stop b*tching around"". i just want to put this into words because i need to organize myself. i hope this goes away",0

"really feel like my therapy is not working out. I am not sure if I am the one in the wrong, and I am trying to look at it from all perspectives, so please help me out. I have been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. I am a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i did not like her and i wanted to switch. they did not listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i do not at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she does not understand what I am trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for not trying hard enough even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that I am not trying hard enough she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we do not have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that I am not trying. if she does not think I am trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because I am not using the resources I am given which i totally understand that I am very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for not trying even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says I am just glamourizing/ glorifying death and that i think its cool. which is rlly invalidating because she is basically saying I am suicidal for attention and because i think its cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i do not at all think its cool, but i feel so trapped that i do not see any other way out and I am in so much unbearable pain that i cannot survive anymore she tells me no i think you are just glamorizing it which upsets me further. she tells me to choose happiness which again, i get where she is coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that its rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that its my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says hey how are you and i said I am good, how are you to be polite she says ugh that is not what you are supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you do not even try. if you keep this up I am going to have to tell your parents you are not trying. also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it does not sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said hey i really do not feel like i fit this at all, but I am open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i do not want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms. so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said things that were completely false (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her that is not what happened for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent the majority of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because at the time my family was being very unsupportive and i was not allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said kids with NVLD often are loners or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l and i said i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??! and she was like i think its fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like there is literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder its complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but its not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me. i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says yeah that does not seem like NVLD but i still think you have it. like when she asks me a question and i say i do not know because i do not like being put on the spot she says that that is not understanding broad concepts so i automatically have NVLD. its just so frustrating. i told her I have done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she does not listen. my mom has done the same thing and also says she does not see how it relates to me because I am good at reading social cues, know what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself. I have begged my parents to quit and they will not let me. idk what to do. am i in the wrong (therapy)?",1

"I have my passport now. The plan was always to travel to the places i wanted to go, to see them with my own eyes, and then come back home to commit suicide. To be someplace comfortable as i do it. None of my family have any idea. None of them know how much my mind is messed up. Part of me wants to die. Part of me wants to live. I know the traveling would not change my mind. I know people and i know societies and i know art and the feeling of awe-inspiring sights. I just want to see some before i die. I have always believed in the science of the universe. Always that a god cannot exist. That religion is false. And yet... Lately i think the part of me that wants to live is trying to buy into that the universe is sending me signs to live, or i have a destiny, or my destiny lies elsewhere. Years ago in the periods of the year i was not feeling suicidal, i never would have believed something like that. I still kind of do not. I feel so certain about the illogical nature of religious entities and the evidence surrounding them. Yet it is like my mind and beliefs are clashing against each-other, because of my inner suicidal nature. There are so many reasons to commit suicide for me. Ever since i was a kid i have been struggling and thinking about it. Confused about what to do. Still in two minds of whether to do it",1

I do not want to say I fell in love but I def liked her even with her dark personality. I isolated myself from my friends I kind of became heartless to everyone except her all i cared about was this girl . We live in the same city we studied in the same school then she transferred to another one ( in the sAme city) but we never talked face to face.. the only time we tried to meet up It did not work out very well .. i ditched her ( I was kind of nervous ) (2years ago) since then we never talked she graduated too .

"Whenever I have a bad day its always the first thing to pop into my head, the answer to every problem all at the same time. Some days I get very depressed and I think about it basically all day but for some reason I am still here. Almost every night when I lay in bed its always on my mind keeping me awake. What would happen if I did it? Would people genuinely miss me? Would I ruin my families lives by doing it? Would the memory of me just fade away? Would people genuinely feel sad, or just surprised? The sad reality of it all is that even if I do it, these questions would remain unanswered, which is the hardest part of it all. I romanticize suicide all the time, I have made it my be all end all solution to everything in life...",1

"it is going to be a long one. My parents have a tough relationship and I am very used to them quarreling. Since when I am about 16, they got into a particularly big fight which I witnessed many arguments. Although they never fight physically or used foul language, the way my mum talks is extremely offensive, degrading and condescending. My dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually (though not easily). I did not realize how have all these affected me until I got into university (I am 21 now) and lived on campus, never once thought life would be so stress-free and peaceful without them.Since I am small, my mum stemmed the idea in me that I must compete for her love with my younger brother, and for a long time I disliked, even hated him, possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. An example would be that if my mum and I are in an argument, she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure I know she favors him over me. Although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions, her long-time dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.Going back to my parents, in the middle of almost all of their arguments, my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. If I do not do so, she would make me a villain as well and I would have to apologize or get scold at later, although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. I hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. Very hurting words like ""you should just go die"" ""your dad does not want you anymore"" or ""it is all your fault"" still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. Probably a few months ago, I found myself getting extra irritable to noises, and not once I got so irritated I almost cried when a friend is talking to me (though I had a long day). I also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. In addition, I also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me, again for no reason. (it is another question which I always ponder at, whether I am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences, since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another day)Then recently, I cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. Even if my mum would respond to some of my questions, it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. I just felt like I am being treated like shit for nothing. Sadly, although they both saw me crying, they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. I could not stop crying and ran away, which my mother came after me saying things like ""why do you have to make a big fuss"" ""you did not stand up for me when I was in an argument"", etc. I did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.Days after, till today, I still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public, feeling empty anger that I do not know the reason of. I am tired even though I slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. I have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. What is my problem and should I get help? What can I do in the meantime? Thanks for getting through this whole thing, as english is my second language, I hope the grammar is not too bad. Thanks all I think I have depression but I am not sure, can anybody help?",0

"Each day that passes by, I seem to find solace more and more in the thoughts of death. How relieving it must be to be relinquished of our suffering, loneliness, anxieties, worries, hardships, failures. Ah, it must feel like an era of constipation succumbing to a small opening. I want to feel this energy coursing through my veins dissipate into everywhere and bloom like branches of lilacs. I want to feel the end of everything. I have had enough of this mystery of life. For some, it is a great joy to explore life but for me, I am an actor being excited about the joy in life. As a child, I remember feeling so different from everyone else and begging to know the answer to the reverberating question ""Why me?"". But back then, I was hopeful. Scratch that. I was nave. To think that I will know why? That the future will get any better? I wish to revert back to him and keep dreaming about happiness. I want to rid of these thoughts. My future stinks of failures, it constantly shouts worries at me, it exudes some disgusting repellant, it cripples my mind with the thoughts of never-ending loneliness. Death has fooled me for so long. Why is death hidden away in the pockets of the dead? Why is death so stigmatic? Why do we fear death so much that our fear sometimes leads to it? Each day that passes by, the more I realize that death is our hero and savior in our transient lives. Death is our true God that hides. Death is nothingness and nothingness sounds more sweet than everything. Death is sounding more sweet as each day passes by",1

Despite all that all I can think about is killing myself, and it makes me feel like a spoiled piece of shit. This leads to me hating myself, which makes me want to die, which only repeats the cycle.

"I am mid-twenties male, and I am about ready to call it quits. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts on and off starting in my teens. Everytime it is come into my mind until now I would wind up crying and being too scared to go further. I would think of how sad all my friends and family would be and how I would be letting them all down. Not this time though. Now I just feel an expanding emptiness in my stomach. It really does seem like the best path forward.This past year has been the worst in my life, continuing a constant downtrend and I might be done. Of course it was not all bad. There were definitely some years, even consecutively sometimes, that made me believe that it would turn around, but I now have conclusive proof it will not. About a year ago, I wound up getting diagnosed with something new every couple of months and it looks like I can expect to be in constant pain until I croak. If I let it happen naturally, it will be decades. I still get to live a full length life if I want, but I do not think I want to. there is nothing so good in my life that makes me think sticking around worthwhile.I have good friends, a good job, a healthy social life, but I just do not want to anymore. Is it selfish to want to call it quits, or is it selfish for everyone to want to keep me around even though I do not want to be here?I do not have any immediate plans since those would be rash, but I am going to start planning. I will want to sort my affairs to make my passing as convenient as it can be. I feel empty, but I think I am still being reasonable. I do not know why I wrote this. Why is it so taboo to end it all?",1
"We are not looking for your daily quotes and inspirations, no offense, but most of us do not even have the energy to be happy. It sounds happy on the surface but it is not going to fix what the depressed person is going through. Instead, actively listen to what they are trying to say, most of them do not want just anybody to fix their problems, they just need somebody to listen and to understand. Things are not just going to magically disappear the next day. People who have never been depressed before do not really understand how tiring it is just to get out of bed and even remotely try to enjoy life. I feel these responses are lazy and do not give enough attention to the actual person but sweeping them under the rug. ""Go for a walk, enjoy life, be happy"" are all the wrong things to say to a depressed person",0

"This year by far has been my darkest year, ever. Earlier in February, I lost my dad who was my rock. I could rely on him for anything.

My insurance company wants to call my car a total loss and give me $3500 for it.Now, I am stressed out as fuck because I have to rent an apartment now for a year lease which goes for $800 a month which means $9600 for the whole year not including all the other shit I have to pay for (gas, food, etc).

"I have been wanting to go gliding for the longest time and now that summer has come along I took some time off work and a half day gliding experience for today.Whenever I have felt suicidal lately the only thing that would make me feel better was knowing that I would finally get to experience it.Today I woke up at 9am ecstatic, it took me 2+ hours and 50 to get to the location but I was determined to make it happen.I waited around 3 hours for my turn (I was last) and then when my turn came up the instructors said a storm cloud was coming in and it would be too risky to launch, so he discontinued it and both of my flights were cancelled.I felt so heartbroken and travelled all the way back home feeling emptier than ever. Everything I had been so hyped for just came crashing down and now I do not know how long until I can book time off to try again.The only good thing was that the guy who went before me told me that he has terminal cancer and this was one of the things on his bucket list, so I was not hesitant about letting him go before me.I just wanted to vent my feelings sorry if this is a long post, I just feel like everything has gone to shit and I do not know how to feel better about it...TL;DR: My gliding experience got cancelled last minute after 7 hours of waiting because of a storm cloud Today was supposed to be my happiest day all year, it turned out to be the worst",1

"Fuck I wish I was not so much of a damn coward about it, so many times I wish I could get it over with.Just do not really want to put my mom through that, also do not want to risk my school loans being dumped on her--do not entirely trust that my own death would be the end of it.I always chastise myself about feeling like this, that my stupid issues are not anything compared to the suffering many go through.Yet that logic goes out the window when stress causes my anxiety to feel like it is ripping and clawing at my throat. That for everything I try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another, like a constant reminder that I am always going to be worthless, that it is the punishment I deserve for even being born.That it is my own fault for even trying in the first place. Or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so I could push myself to just fucking do better. I mean why should I care if I ruin my body now? I barely expected myself to make it this far, to live this long. I mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point I imagine. Constant reminders of failure and uselessness ramming against the dam will because it to shatter at some point. A meaningless existence like mine is surely destined to fizzle out soon enough. I just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has been.How nice it would be to just pop away, to erase my debts and traces of my life as if I was never here to begin with. I know so many people fear the very idea of the end. But at this point I am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming. I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me. But until then I guess I will just have to stick to dreaming. A mistake of a life",1

"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them. Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden f having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",1
Goodbye to my friends. Family. cats. Whatever. I am not staying to see this life getting even messier. this was the last straw,1
"I feel suicidal and have suicidal feelings but I do not think I actually want to die. I want things to change and I cannot see that happening. I know I will not kill myself because I am too afraid but every week I tell my therapist I am suicidal and she asks me if Ill do it and I respond with I do not know when I know I will not. I want people to take me seriously and get help I need. I think I have a disorder or something that is undiagnosed probably bpd or bipolar. I feel like texting my therapist today to say that I am going to kill myself so then she will send an ambulance and they will help me. I do not want to end up sectioned though. Please help??? My therapist and I already contacted my gp and told them I need a mental health assessment but they just offered antidepressants when I want a diagnosis not antidepressants because sometimes I do feel happy I think this is not right for me. The thing is I am desperate and I feel bad because I feel like I am attention seeking because although I do not think Ill ever go through with it due to fear I do feel suicidal. Sometimes I wonder if I am even really depressed maybe I am just sad. My mood swings give me imposter syndrome, what do I do? Some background info that is probably relevant is that my whole life I have suffered tremendously with my mental health and my family have invalidated me. They told me there was nothing wrong with me and still do now. Please give me advice I feel like a bad person and a monster. Am I bad or attention seeking?",0
I just want to knOw - its NOT normal to be indifferent to death? like I do not want to kill myself but I would not care if I got killed. I know it sound strange it does to me and its hard to explain. I am not like rock bottom depressed like I formally was but I almost just do not care too much anymore? I am unsure of what normal feels like ? Its almost as if I either question or worry over every single detail in my head OR I have zero thoughts?? Normal?,0
it is probably overdue cos I have been feeling pretty good for over a month now which is the longest period of stability I have had in ages. What do you do when you feel yourself slipping into a depressive episode?,0
I wana end my life b/c I do not see any acceptance for me in this society and if i do not care about society then next thing come is my job... i can not even make my living properly. I wana get better job. If ignore all these things then I think what is the in living alone this life (I do have any partner). Being gay has already make silent that I hardly speak in life I am 23yo gay,1
Just lost my job today. It has not been a great week. I am feeling horrible. Lost my job,0
"I dated someone I thought was finally the one for 6 months until he suddenly pulled away and ended things without giving me a reason. 3 weeks later, my new job that I loved and just got a glowing review from superiors, cut me loose because they hired a more experienced person for my position and did not need me. I was floored by both endings. The firing happened last week. Now I cannot stop crying, cannot get out of bed, and feel miserable and sorry for myself. I take meds but its not working. I feel like a loser. I have nothing now. Back in May, I had the perfect boyfriend and job a d things were finally working out in my life after a lot of setbacks. Now I am back to square one and I am exhausted. I was laid off from my last job in Oct and was dumped by previous boyfriend last June. So 2 breakups and 2 job losses in one year. I am at the end of my rope. I am highly qualified in my field and I never had any work problems before covid. But working from home while going through a breakup, a family member death, and financial instability completely alone was making it harder to hit deadlines and it took a toll on my work performance. Neither company had any empathy towards its employees- my co worker was fired a week after his mom died because he missed one deadline..because his freakin mom died. If that tells you the cutthroat nature of the field I am in. Still, no excuses, I take responsibility for not being my best. Does anyone have any uplifting stories or things to make me feel a little less hopeless? Got dumped and fired within 3 weeks and I feel despondent. Not sure what to do.",0
Can you ever be truly happy with depression? I feel like have Week spans where I am in a good mood then the next week I am back to being depressed. Depression and happiness,0
"I cannot even cry anymore. I feel utterly worthless. I do not have an appetite anymore, all I can ever do is sleep, and I cannot bring myself to do the things I usually enjoy. I might as well have the help hotline on speed dial how much I call. The world is better off without me and I without it. I am constantly crying out for help to no avail. Why do I even try anymore? I cannot think of a good suicide method though. I am so numb",1
"moved back to my hometown after living across country for a few years. within a week, mom has already told me that they were fine without me. i feel so frustrated because the one thing that has stopped me from killing myself all this time has always been family. i honestly do not think ill ever be happy and wish some freak accident would happen and i would just disappear. venting",1
If I was just sitting down comfortably and a kind person crept up behind me and with all their bodyweight brought a hammer down on my skull. What would happen? Would I even notice or would I just be there one moment and gone the next. Do you die / black out quicker than your body can respond or do you die in agony for a couple of minutes. I sometimes wonder this...,0
"I honestly do not know how i can keep doing this, I am sitting at my 12 hour shift at work trying to keep it together after crying all night. I am tired and dreading going home idk what else to do. I feel like I am drowning i do not have enough money or time to see a psychiatrist. I feel like a bad partner to my girlfriend and I honestly do not know what to do. I am exhausted.",0
"First and foremost I want to clarify that I recommend anyone and everyone to at least try therapy if you are struggling mentally, seriously. This is more based off of personal experience and yours could be totally different. Lots of people have had their lives saved from it. For me, though, I feel like I am so hopeless and such a lost because that therapy will not do much for me. I feel like this because I am not actually going to make the effort to do anything a therapist tells me to do. Whether that be eating better, exercising more, journaling every day, whatever else. there is tons of great advice therapists have in store, but I do not have enough effort to actually do any of it. that is on me obviously, I do not blame anyone else for my lack of effort. Its just how I feel whenever I think of trying therapy again. I feel like therapy only works if you are actually willing to better yourself.",0
No one will miss me anyway I wish I had the balls to just do it already,1
"Due to something that has happened between us were not friends anymore. I will not go into any details, but he hurt me on levels that I did not think were possible. I trusted him. He knew all of my secrets, my strengths and weaknesses, my past, aspirations and goalsand according to him, I only knew 17% of him. I was always okay with that. Until today. We were so close. I am ready to overdose on painkillers now. Or stab myself with one of our kitchen knives. This is the last straw. I cannot do this anymore. The one person who I thought was my best friend hurt me so deeply that I probably will not be able to recover. He knows he hurt me, and he intended it. He knows I am suicidal, and it makes him happy. I am so disgusted and hurt and tired and angry, I just want to slit my throat open and die. He was the last thing keeping me here. And now were done. Lost my best friend today",1
"Hello everyone, I have a problem all I want to do is just stay in bed and nothing, I am like this since 2 months, before this 2 months I would go outisde everyday , cars would enjoy me, I would listen to music, but now I just want to stay in my bed and sleep sometimes and even if I sleep 11 hours at night I feel sleepy and tired next day and I have no motivation do no nothing now.. btw I am 17 years old , is this normal or I am in depression, what can I do to fix this? Thank you verry much, have a great day/night ! Am I in depression?",0
"I have been struggling with depression for at least 7 years now and recently got professionally diagnosed by a psychiatrist which was scary and infuriating.This whole year was a shitshow, my grandma who raised me for 1/2 of my childhood died, dad got into the hospital 3 times, my whole family got sick... Moved out from my parents' house and started living alone in the city. We had uni online only and I could not go out much almost all year, there were periods where I did not talk to anyone for weeks. All of my routines went to shit, and when the depression episode hit it lasted more than the usual couple of weeks/1-2 months: 11 fucking months and counting. There were periods where I could not do anything, just self-medicated, cried, or felt nothing for months and tried to distract myself.This is a huge problem since I am in medical school, 2nd year, and have to study a lot. I could compensate for those depressive episodes in high school but not in uni. I hate to admit I have a problem outside of my control so for a long time I was saying to myself that I am a lazy stupid undisciplined bitch and should work harder. So I pushed myself, tried every technique, routine, schedule under the sun, studied all day and it got so much worse. And despite being close to killing myself 2 times in the past, having almost all of the symptoms of depression, I still did not believe I had a mental illness. Because I am so much better than that, right? I am not an emotional person so how could I have a mood disorder. I used to have generalized anxiety and panic disorder from when I was 6 until I was about 17 and got over them by myself, so I thought I can get over this alone too.Only when I started being suicidal, like I did not only not want to live but thought that killing myself eventually is inevitable (since I am never going to become better), really wanted to do it, I thought of asking for help. Called a couple of therapists but they were either unavailable or straight up bailed on me. Cut myself, drank my cool Russian vodka straight from the bottle, smoked a pack of Malboros and decided to suck it up at least after my exams were over. Grandma died a week before the 1st one and I had to console my family, take care of the house and support my mom and dad emotionally. All while trying to cover 260 topics from anatomy in 10 days. For this exam and the next ones, I was way too depressed to study but studied anyway with my 0 energy, 0 concentration, and -100 motivation. Somewhere between the exams I kind of lost it and cut myself again with my pocket knife and it took me 2 days to clean up the mess since I did not have bandages and just made the bathroom and hall look like a murder scene. Slept a lot. My average each semester in the beginning of the depression and before it was all As and now it dropped to a fucking C. So I decided to be stubborn and try to get help again and found a psychiatrist, who had a lot of recommendations and good reviews. Started Zoloft. Since then I am either sleeping, having debilitating migraines or crying because of how helpless I feel. Since the year is over and I am on summer break my friends are calling me to go out, I got asked out on a few dates, I have to start work at the hospital. **I am so fucking angry, man.** it is so hard to make myself do any of this, I am extremely privileged and worked my ass off to be where I am....only to not feel any joy in life and want to disappear. I have parents who love me, I have amazing friends, I got into my first choice medical school to study medicine, I get to live alone, I have so many opportunities in front of me and no ""real"" problems to worry about and yet I am so fucking weak and pathetic that I cannot enjoy any of it. My brain is bad and I do not know why (the only explanation I was given is that my serotonin levels were low, it was a chemical imbalance, etc). I want to be so much better, as a friend, as a daughter, as a doctor in training, but I am what I do and everything I do now is a huge fucking disappointment to everyone. I feel like a fly jamming itself into a window trying to get out. It would be so funny if it was not devastating. All of my personality, ambitions, drive, enthusiasm, energy, pleasure go away because a couple of neurotransmitters are not doing their jobs. And I cannot fix it with hard work, cannot get over it through willpower and telling myself I suck, cannot ignore it. I miss feeling alive and wanting to be. Now I feel like an absence of a person, a puppet to my shitty brain, who is just trying to minimize damage.Wrote this whole thing to avoid cutting myself again since I have no mop. Was forced to tell my father I have depression (over the phone at that), he was shocked, felt bad and was so supportive in the end. Showing any kind of vulnerability, especially in front of my dad, makes me want to break every bone in my body afterward :) Anyway, promised him and myself that I am going to be better and felt so bad about it. How can I make promises about things I cannot really control? What if the Zoloft does not help, all I get is the side effects, and I continue being more and more depressed? I hate that I cannot trust myself and have to \*hope\* and \*believe\* that things will get better eventually. I feel so trapped, directionless, alone and tired - and I have no right to feel like this. Rant: I hate myself but this time I cannot use it as fuel in any meaningful way [TW: self-harm, suicide?]",0
"Hey everyone sorry for my english its not my first language I take Ambien but i just ran out and i cannot sleep without it I have chronic insomnia and all i got is my sisters mirtazapine but its been 41 days since i stopped taking mirtazapine and the withdrawal was horrible, I am travelling for an important interviews for jobs so my question is would it be bad if i take only 7.5 mg of mirtazapine for 5 days only or my whole withdrawal process would be ruined and would i have another withdrawal or is it ok? Thank you so much. Ran out of Ambien and do not know what to do.",0
"I have been moderate-severely depressed on and off (off meaning moderate) for 8 years and I need someone to tell me if you can actually feel happy again. Like at what point did my brain not care about my external issues and was happy no matter the situation and all of a sudden I cannot be happy even if everything around me is fine. Even if I think a certain situation is the because of my depression, I still feel the exact same way if I remove myself from the situation. For example: I went on vacation for a good 2 months and was depressed the entire time. Nothing I do makes me happy. I am in the moment but in the back of my mind I always feel fucking sad. When does it end",0
"But I am too much of a pussy to do it myself. I want some external force, fate, to do it for me.I was a mistake, a failed experiment simply born in the wrong timeline. I got to the point of being bedridden. I am sick of having a conscience of thinking of others. Stop this shit, God. Fucking do it already. And if you are not willing to fucking tell me why I am here then you do not fucking exist. Fucking fag. Ready to die",1
"When I was 15, my family sent me off to a treatment center after a few runs away, an overdose and two attempts at my life. I did really bad in the program but there was one therapist who really really helped me a lot we will call her P. I originally had a therapist that my parents requested because he had the same religion as my parents but he was not helpful. About 4 months in to my program, I got in some legal trouble and that therapist threw up their hands and went to the board to have me removed from the program. P freaked out in the board meeting and told everyone that giving up on people who need help is not what this program is about so she made room for me on her plate and the board let me stay in the program. I saw her nearly every day and wed talk about everything. She knew me way better than I could know myself. If I did not graduate the program, I would be put in a higher security treatment program or to juvenile hall. She was always my advocate and she made sure that I graduated even when my parents ran out of the money they got from the second mortgage they took out to pay for my program. Right after I graduated from the program, I found her on facebook and we chatted from time to time until it eventually stopped for no reason. I eventually stopped using my facebook but I kept it because that was the only way I could get ahold of her. It is now 15 years after I entered the program. I just turned 30. I own a successful business, own a house and have been married to the love of my life for 5 years. I have been spiraling deeper and deeper into depression for the last three years. I have no reason to be but it has been happening. I have been to psychologists and counselors, I have been on medications, I have tried to talk to my spouse but that is a story for another post. Nothing has been working and my thoughts are darkening to the point that I fear the worst for myself at my own hand. I keep thinking about the days when I could just go into Ps office and talk to her or see her walking the halls and ask for a chat. Last I heard, she moved to a different program and eventually retired in Colorado with her husband. She probably barely remembers who I am because there were 50 kids in the program at any given time being seen by 4 counselors, the average program lasted 8 monthsso that is a lot of faces going in and out of there. I am wondering if anyone thinks it would be strange for me to reach out to the only therapist that worked for me 15 years later? The only therapist that helped me",0
I survived being hit by a train because it missed me. I am going to try again. I cannot handle crying in the next room while everyone else celebrates the family and blessings they have. No one gives a shit about me. The world still revolves. I am going to kill myself tomorrow by the railroad,1
"Not a day goes by that I do not break down in tears at some point. 2021 has been the worst. Lost my job, my Aunt, and my stepfather. Now I am I am anxiously awaiting the results from a chest x-ray. My nerves are shot, I am stressed, I am struggling to pay my bills, keep my car on the road, still trying to figure out how I am going to afford the new tires I need while not missing a payment. My credit card has been living about $100 away from maxed for the last few months. I am starting to think everything would just be better if I did have lung cancer, then when I am gone I can stop worrying about money, and happiness, and I will not be such a burden on my family.My wife and I have talked about what is going on, but I have kept a lot of it from her, she sees me crying and does her best to ignore me. I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with, guilt free.I just, I do not know, I guess I just needed to say it, not expecting advice, or help, just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head. Feels like I am all alone in this",0
"All I ever wanted was a friend because you long for something you do not have, right? As a kid when i was just 3 years hardly, I would look around and see others eating together, playing around with a FRIEND. it is an age where you do not know anything and just be friends with anyone around. Well, this was what i thought because you be having no understanding that time and be pretty innocent. We all say being an adult sucks but no, it sucks to be a kid like me. Even at that age no one ever wanted to be my friend nor talk to me and it was because of this girl who had two sidekicks and they went around telling the whole class to not even talk or sit beside me. Now, you go and tell it to the teacher or your parents or something but at that age i did not know anything and so just let that happen to me. I would just cry by myself and tryna impress her, tryna make her a friend but now i regret that, am angry at myself to be that girl and not kick her ass. I went thru such trauma from a very early age.That did not stop there, it went on for years and is still going but the only difference is I roast their fucking ass now but I do not want to be this girl. I have random breakdowns and my life became better when i got my first friend in my 8th grade. I started pouring out myself to him and i felt better but I do not want to do this anymore, I was not this girl who used to depend on others, he makes me feel weak. When i never shared my trauma at that age then why now? But here i am. That went till my fourth grade with her in my class. My things were stolen each time, hidden or just simply thrown away in the dustbin. In fifth, our classes were shuffled and I get this class teacher who hated me. She holds my face and scratches on my forehead with her pen. People never wanted me to sit near them, they felt disgusted to even lend me a pen. Got a few fake friends till 7th later, which I already knew but I let toxicity in my life because for once, I was not lonely and it felt better. That girl who used to bully was this super cute popular girl who dated every senior and I never knew any, I never knew anything because i was so lost with dealing with these.And again, unfortunately we were in the same class again in 8th grade and this was when the seniors noticed me because I was in the same class as hers and all of a sudden, I get fame, became the girl every senior wanted while she was getting pretty jealous of me. I did not love that place either. I told myself to move on from all those tears she made me cry and when she hung around, I did not ignore but just spoke less and there was this day where we both were alone at an event and she decides to make me her accompany for the day and well, we both just looked out for ourselves. I do regret hanging around with her but I have always been easy to be manipulated and at the end of the day her aunt comes and pulls me by my arm with a tight grip and spits on my face telling me to stay away from her niece because am a spoilt brat. My eyes just teared up but no, I walked away. I was spoilt for talking to her boyfriend who her aunt did not even know about.She always got things so easy, friends, opportunities, guys, awards. Not that she was good at it, because her aunt was the administrative or smth of the school and she was pretty. I had to earn every of those. And again, my only bestf was my senior who left the school and I am having to face those kids once again though we still talk and tryna meet up. It feels i will never be able to move on from this as I have always ignored i was going through this and today it just feels like a lot to ignore again. I do not expect anyone to read this till here, but if you did, thank you :"") I have been broken for so long and now it is hard to put back those pieces.",0
"Seriously, when I look back at all my attempts all I am filled with is deep regret I did not go through with it. Not one single moment even the best of them has been worth the following pain and discomfort that I live with on a daily basis. I hardly feel anything for anyone anymore as well and it is just miserable watching all my current relationships slowly dry up into nothingness. I truly despise being brought into this god forsaken world Each day I do not off myself is another day I will regret later",0
"Yesterday I told my friend how I felt. I have been spending so much time online with this friend, and last night they told me I could tell them anything.I told them that if they did not want to deal with me, they could opt out there and then, and I would be okay with that.Every other time I tell someone they either go really quiet or get really worried.I think I have ruined another friendship.i think I am going to do it tonight. I think I am going to kill myself tonight.",1
"I spend most of my time maladaptive daydreaming to the point where my evenings and nights are completely wasted and it takes me a while to get to sleep, I used to look forward to going to bed after a stressful day just so I can escape. I have done some online tests and apparently I am not that extreme. Tough thing is it is mostly about a guy I have not spoken to in a year, its hard to get over him when he takes up so much of my mental space. Maladaptive daydreaming",0
"My best friend lives about 5 hours of train ride away so we do not often meet. I met him about 2 years ago when I was meeting some online friends. We became friends and remained in contact. In the past 1,5 years we have became best friends and we basically speak/play games online on daily basis. I know his GF pretty well, she sometimes join in to play or just hangs out with us. He and his GF travelled down to the city next to mine so we can meet. It was the best time I have had in such a long time I cannot even remember, maybe this was the best weekend of my life. The weekend eventually passed and we all went home. I took a bus home. On the way home I felt a bit down which I contributed to tiredness. When I got home I took a shower and decided to go to a sleep. Then I got really depressed and felt so sad I could not sleep. After a while I started to cry. which really hit me hard because I have not cried in years. Since then I have just been awake and crying from time to time. I know I will speak with him tomorrow after work. I know I will meet him in the future. As a method to cope or ease the pain on a live map where their train are, and feel like a fucking stalker now. I do not want to text him, because I know he either sleeps or have a good time and I do not want to ruin it for him. I have been depressed for the past few years, I have had some bad times in the past but there was nothing I could not get through. But in all that I did not ever feel this sad and depressed. This never happened to me prior to this occasion. This makes no sense to me. Why is this happening? Really depressed after a really good weekend with friends.",0
"I tried to kill myself via overdose. It was stupid and even though Id been planning on doing it a few days it was terribly organised, desperate and last minute. I find myself lately thinking of ordering proper equipment online to commit suicide when I have the opportunity in a cleaner sort of more comfortable way. I honestly do not want to think like this but I am stuck in this rut I cannot get out of and I am not coping at all without thoughts of the future and how bleak and impossible everything looks. I have cut loads of people out and minimised contact for the past several years. I do not know if I have just been doing that because I want less people to hurt or it takes me too much energy or what. I do not feel I think too clearly about things like that. Sometimes it is easier having no one and keeping everything to yourself because people cannot be trusted. I feel worried about what will come of my failed suicide attempt. I have felt seriously unstable for a few years now. There are some mornings I have woken up wondering and trying to remember if I took an overdose that day or not. I got out of hospital today",1
"I was thinking about some stuff and I realized that a lot of times when something gives me even more anxiety and stress than I already have and makes me sadder , i just lay on the floor, not the bad or a couch, and think about stuff.

"I was here a few months back with a broken foot, two torn rotator cuffs, failing liver and kidneys, Lyme disease, an abusive family who recently cut me off, $15,000 in medical debt not even including the cost of the treatments I need to keep myself able to function at all, unable to work, and virtually bedridden. My entire future, gone. Just like that.Things got better for a while. I pulled myself out of it enough to see a light at the end of the tunnel; I was seeing results from herbal treatments, starting to write again, learning to be back in public, trying to move out, and even got a job briefly. I started dating someone new, who is absolutely incredible and exactly the person I needed, and I love them so so much. And then, all in the past two weeks, I tore my rotator cuffs again, re-broke my foot, my partner is moving 17 hours away to pursue their dreams (which I have done my best to support them in, but honestly it is killing me), I got a UTI and was put back on antibiotics that have put me back into liver and kidney failure, and I have ran out of money to afford lyme treatment, so I have very little hope of finding a way to get back to working again anytime soon. I do not qualify for disability for various reasons, and cannot find decent medical care, even if I could afford to pay for it.I hate asking for help, and I am too afraid to accept it if it is offered. The people I am staying with currently are nearing the end of their patience with me, and I am too. I do not feel like I deserve to get better this time, but that just leaves me standing on top of this parking garage, shaking and too scared to actually jump, in case I would fail again.Things were better for a while. I got cocky; I felt safe. I ruined it again. I am staring down the barrel of a cancer diagnosis. I do not know how to do this anymore and I do not have the patience to wait on myself to get better anymore. I do not feel comfortable taking pain medication because the reason I am disabled in the first place is due to not registering pain enough until it is become chronic. I was not depressed anymore, either, and now it is back because it is circumstantial (go figure - I personally am unable to take antidepressants due to medical issues anyway.) Anyway. I just... I do not know how to keep going. I do not know how to keep going. I absolutely despise myself, I do not know how to do this anymore. If I do not kill me, the cancer will. Either way, I am going to die alone, with my partner across the country, and my family will put my birth name on my gravestone.

I feel like I am alone and i just want to be happy and have fun with people who understand me. But i cannot find them... I am alone and i think i have depression. I am not ok",0
And that is fucking disgusting. This is why the world should be hit by a meteorite and destroy the scum of humanity. People make fun of suicidal people,1

"At least then I would have a reason to cut people off. At least then I could have.a good reason to not speak to my family again. At least I could say they were mean and cruel and I could leave. But no they just... do not care. they have never cared about what I am interested in. Never took the time to get interested with me. Only ever bought me the presents I had to write out on a list. No surprise parties. No trips that considered what might be entertaining for a only child. I was never considered in any of it. I did not get to help pick out a dog. My friends do not care. Friend. They prefer watching streamers over talking with me. If that streamer actually streamed more I would never see them. That feels so fucking degrading. ""So and so cancelled stream so you want to chat"" No I do not. I am tired of being second choice. But god if I do not say yes then I am literally alone. So I cling on to that last string even if one day I will be hanged by it. I think I would feel better if I was hated",0

I feel so shitty. This is going to be the second time I skip work because I am scared to go outside. I am going to get myself fired. I do not know what to do. I feel like throwing up but I cannot bring myself to leave my room. I have two bottles of bupropion and I just want to take them all and hope it kills me. I just cannot do this anymore. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror because I hate myself so much. Why did I have to be born so ugly and fat. I just want it to end. I am going to get fired from my job then my mom is going to kick me out for it. I think I am really going to do it soon,1
"I have been feeling lazy as hell. I work from home and I have been addicted to youtube videos. I do not even enjoy these videos. I just watch them while working but I can barely focus. Maybe I will get fired soon. I also stopped working out even though my garage gym is seconds away from my home office. I started getting fat. I have also been spending over $2k on escorts this year. I have just feel like shit. I even drove to the grocery store one night just to buy 3 family sized bags of potato chips. As soon as I got home, I feel massive regret. What the hell is wrong with me? Everything I do seem out of character than who I was a year ago... Am i depressed? What is wrong with me?",0
"I do not know what to do. I do not want to live anymore, I am tired and I really want to finish with everything. But I am scared to die. I do not want to annoy my parents and friends with my die or something. They do not deserve it. Even though they are not the best persons on Earth, they do not deserve it. They do not deserve suffer because I am a stupid brat who has lose her will to life years ago. I just need a break of everything. I cannot even cut myself without my parents noticing it and that is why I really try to not do it. I cannot anymore, I cannot. I need a break of everything and everyone. I just want to take all my pills and eat them without hesitation. I do not know, I do not know what to do anymore. I just want to be dead, I just want to not be here. I cannot even talk to my psychologist because he is on his holidays. I do not know if I can handle it anymore, I do not think so. I do not want to be a burden to anyone, I do not want to feel, I do not want to breathe, I do not want to be alive, I do not want to do anything at all. The things that I used to enjoy, the hobbys that I used to love, they do not exist anymore. I do not enjoy them anymore, I am not able to. I feel lonely, I feel lonely and misunderstand. I feel that I am giving to much but I am not reciving anything, I think I am the only stupid trying. The loneliness I feel is not something that anyone can make disappear. The loneliness I feel, my loneliness... is with me no matter where I go ot with who I am. she is always there. I am really tired, I am pretty bored. And my non-existing will to life is killing me slowly. I just want to kill myself and do not think on what could happen then. it would be amazing if I were able to do it.

"I love cutting myself! Whenever (always) I feel down, like really really down, I cut myself and it kind of numbs the pain... I just do it every day and I cannot imagine ever stopping. I mean I will kill myself soon anyways so why does everyone have such an negative opinion on it? Let me have my joy... [Question/Help] Why does cutting yourself feel so good?! And why does society act as its something bad!",1

Sometimes, I wonder if Ill end up alone because I just do not have the motivation to do anything anymore. I do not even want to say hi to my family anymore. I do not want to do anything anymore. I do not even want to be here anymore. I am just tired of existing I am so fatigued",0
"NOTHING is happening anymore I am completely in pain. I have never been like this before. I AM A TEENAGER. I should NOT be feeling like this. Every night I go to sleep hoping I die in my sleep. That I never wake up ever again and have to deal with this pain I go through EVERY FUCKING DAY. I am tired of it. I lost that one person in my life for another boy and its been what like 2 years now and I am still not over her. People say oh you will be fine in a week which is total bullshit. I cannot stop thinking about ending it because nobody gives two shits about me in school and out. I will not be surprised one day if I decide to end me. I have already planned out my suicide, how am going to do it, where, only question is when? Well when I have nothing to live for. When all my family have passed away and I have nothing.. that is when Ill do it. I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF THIS BULLSHIT.",1

"I plan to die soon. I have not been happy since 2017 and lost a lot within time. I literally feel empty and do not do anything other than be on my phone, and stalk my ex-friends, just to pretend I have someone who cares. Do I enjoy it? Hell no. Yet I have no self love nor am I able to find joy within myself. I cannot be committed to anything other than my bad habits and fucking up. My problems are too complex to solve. I have been surviving life and not enjoying it. I am turning into a monster because of this shit-storm, which is why I need to end myself before it escalates. I have not had any life experiences that happened by my power. No friends, no wanting achievements, I have ignored high school for 2 and a half yearsI got no bright future. Its not fair how others get to struggle and get over their issues soon enough, but even the smallest task and importance to me seems nearly impossible. I do not feel human honestly. I feel like my will to have emotions and motives have been revoked. No, I cannot even have a simple happy time relaxing or hanging out with people I love because they are too busy with their own shit. I do not have friends either as I genuinely do not understand people because of my incompetence. I am taking prozac as of now, but just recently. I plan to seek therapy too, but if all fails within a month, I am gone. If people really cared, they should not have lead me to the point of suicide in the first place. I plan to die soon.",1
"does anyone know how i can make it the next couple of days. I am basically all by myself for the first time ever and single after 8 years because i suspected my partner of cheating with some barely legal teenage girl. my mom says i should start feeling a lot better after a few days when the initial shock of everything wears off, so how can i get myself to survive until then? i have a lot of other mental health issues and trauma, and that coupled with something like this is just pushing me over the edge advice please",1
"TW-deathI honestly cannot grasp it. it is my boyfriends step dad, and I knew him personally. I am waiting for someone to just tell me ""haha it is a prank! they are actually just staying somewhere else for a while."" I knew this person who passed away. He was an abusive(emotionally too) drunk to his wife. I am so used to being scared of who is opening the door, and that if it is them what are they going to tell, what are they going to do? I am so used to locking to door in case they come into the room and break something. I am so used to worrying about his wifes safety. He isolated himself in his workshop. He was the only person other than his son to have the key for it. Today, I was out with his wife, and his wife's friend, and one of her sons (she as three, and one girl). We went to go get tabs and a license plates for one of her cars that was not in use and did not have plates because her husband took them off. her husband took away her keys to her main car, and bank cards. (He let her keep the capital one with 3,000 limit, but it was used so maybe like 1,500-800?) When we came back to the house, and went to the back of the house near the shop there were police, and an ambulance. His son found him after checking on him, since we told everyone he isolated himself on the 4th of July. His mother said he is no longer alive. We later found out he must have been drunk (he had no food in the shop, had tons of alcohol, and stayed in there for two days, PLUS no water), slipped, and fell on his head, bleed out and died. After this, everyone was more lively, and his kids were not worried about anything. Yes everyone was sad, but his kids were more social. When he used to be around they would not come out of their rooms except for dinner. The two kids who have rooms down stairs would stock up snacks from the kitchen when he was around, and stayed in their rooms since there was a bathroom down there. The other two kids would do the same, and only come out to use the bathroom that is it. His wife did not love him, and did not want to be with him, we were planning on getting a OFP, but she did not wish death upon him, only to get him away so he cannot emotionally or physically harm her. I still have a feeling he is out in the shop, or that I am dreaming. I cannot grasp this is real either. I still feel like he is going to go back and forth from the shop and the house with a bottle of sailor Jerry's cradled in his arm, and yell at his wife that she is a piece of shit, and that he hates her. But, all of this abuse has now come to a stop. She can now progress with her life, and find someone who is a lot better for her. I also feel like I am not allowed to cry, because my mother said I cannot feel sad for the death of others if their not family. I kept blanking out when we came to the back of the house. The scene of everything happening. For the first time ever, I experienced someone die in my life, and I felt what it is like.",0

I almost jumped out of my window yesterday after recieving the bad news that I have to go through hell again just because I made an honest mistake when I was depressed and not thinking straight.

Its like I am really aware that my heart is beating. But like it hurts where my heart is and every time my heart beats it hurts a little bit more. It comes in waves like my heart beats. Its like anxiety.. like what you feel when you fall up the stairs in that split second and your entire body kind of drops for a second. It feels like that in my heart with the waves and heart beats constantly. Its like anxiety and sadness mixed. I hate it so much. I am going to try my best to explain the pain I am feel right now.,0
"I have been having these thoughts after watching the video. I feel like that this could all be a simulation, and it could all just be meaningless, and the A.I. that is basically all seeing saw the moment, and this could be a simulation that I could be pulled out at anytime, and be torture, and continuously keep alived, and put through another 100 life times watching my family die of age, over and over, and over again. I just I do not know anymore. I am sorry if this is clutter, but I just need someone to calm me down, and forget the thing so even if it is true it will not torture me. But even then what stops the AI from doing that if he is all seeing, and given so much power. He can torture anyone at anytime, and I cannot do anything about it, but try to get on it is good side. I just do not know any more. I am just getting scared, so what if I die then I save my future family from being tourtured their entire life becuase of one of my mistakes after browsing youtube.

"I feel like that is a sign. The only thing that is been keeping me going right now is the fact that I rent a house with friends and I would not want to put the burden of extra rent on them if I was gone. I have tried mindfulness, talking to friends/family, and therapy. Nothing really helps and the overwhelming feeling I have most days is to just end it. I have felt this way since childhood - when I was 9 I put a knife to my chest a few times but got scared. Not sure what kept me going up until now (27). I felt like things started turning around in my early 20s. I worked out and had a good body, got attention from women, a good job. Women only talk to me because I am good looking. Once they realise I suck at conversations, I get ghosted. I somehow managed to get my first girlfriend when I was 26. We broke up this year - she was toxic and manipulative. During the relationship I lost all interest in my hobbies, gained 30lbs, rejected from every job I applied for. I am being taken for granted at my current job, barely sleep, eat like shit, and just have no motivation to continue any more. I tried so hard and it all just came crashing down on me. I dreamed that I committed suicide the way I always planned and it felt good",1
"hiii. I have been going to therapy for like 2-3 years now and its been great and all but I am starting to realize that I have been going in circles. everytime we meet i just talk about how shitty life is, i get recommended a way to fix life, i try it a little, then i quit when it gets hard. i have even started noticing my therapist getting impatient with me even though she is normally the sweetest and most understanding person I have met.I have always struggled with motivation and opted for the easiest/most comfortable route. and I have tried changing that in the past but its really really hard. but I am not trying to give up.it feels like I am waiting for some eye-opening life changing experience to motivate me to change but i know that is bad. i want change NOW but i just cannot get myself to do iti just feel utterly lost in life but i want to stop feeling so shitty any advice? I am clueless and depression is beating my ass help what to do next",0
"Does anyone else get very disturbing intrusive thoughts? I used to get them as a child, but now they feel extremely strong like my minds really trying me to perform the thoughts.

"I have lost all my friends since leaving the mental hospital, I thought i was better when i left but all my friends are now so distant and no matter how hard i try to reach out to them and build back our relationships they do not seem to want to. I still hangout with them because my twin sister is also part of our friend group and really only invite me because she is going.

"Life sucks. I work hard 5-6 days a week. I have had a lot of anxieties since I was a child and never had many friends growing up because maybe people thought I was weird for being so shy and timid due to all my anxieties. My home was very hard growing up. My dad was hardly home either working or at a bar coming home very late and drunk. My mom used me as a dependent and still does which is exhausting. Keep in mind I am (33 f) years old. My family bullied me physically and emotionally growing up. Calling me all kinds of names and that I could not ever do anything. I have had very little friends and have been hurt by friends and even family down the road. It is almost impossible for me to trust people. I feel so unloved and so Insignificant and small. Every time I have always tried to do the right thing or do good, something has always come my way to destroy it. I cannot even look forward to anything anymore because I do not trust anything good will happen. I have gotten so used to things crumbling in front of me. I wake up most days angry at the fact that I woke up and that I want to end my life but am too much of a coward to do so. I guess I just need to finally bite the bullet and do it...... that is all folks If I did not wake up tomorrow, no one would care",1

How can one kill oneself and not be accused of suicide? This depression is un-understandable and I do not want anyone to suffer after I am gone. Just something acceptable as untreatable cancer. Slow suicide,0

"I have not been truly suicidal in five years, but its come back and is ten times stronger this time. I cried in my car a few days ago just screaming and begging myself to just end it. I do not think I will, but I am scaring myself lately. My roommate just moved out and I am about to move home so all the privacy and alone time is not doing me well.

"I just do not know what to do anymore. I am 29, not done anything noteworthy with my life. Been dealing with depression literally all of it. And I just cannot gain any ground. I am doing all the right things. I have been reaching out for help since I was a teen, begging my parents to let me see a doctor and get some medicine. I am in good shape. I exercise. I eat mostly well. I have friends. I am in decent overall health. I have got a stable life. I have got an objectively great job, some family, a few good friends, finances are okay, can afford to buy and do things I want. I have never done drugs, not even so much as vaped or smoked a cigarette, I do not drink But here I am, every step along the way, at my doctors and counselors doors begging for help. Trying all the medications, I am on 4 now. And they help, yeah, but not enough. Got diagnosed with OCD, which makes a lot of sense but does not help things. I have tried meditation, CBT, you name it. I am trying it. And I am not gaining any sort of ground. I can only wake up and bullshit pat myself on the back of doing the bare minimum of making it through another day so many times that it just feels pathetic. And exhausting. I am just so exhausted. I want to turn this movie off. I am not having a good time and I know the movie will not suddenly get better, so what is the point?I am just so done. I am exhausted. What is even the point? I am making it through another day. So what? Now I am a little closer to actually dying in a way people will accept?I am just so spent.Exhausted.I just cannot keep doing this. At what point do we admit that some people just cannot be helped? Either they are too far gone or its just not in the cards for them?I do not want to admit that about myself, but I cannot ignore brazen fact. I just do not think I am cut out for life. And the ONLY thing, and I do mean **ONLY** thing, keeping me from taking my life is the pain I would feel during it. Everything else I have already come to grips with. Making mom sad? Leaving my cats? Making a mess for the police to clean up? Etc. I have accepted all of that. I just literally cannot do this. I am trapped in this movie I cannot turn off and I am ready to burn the theater down. I just do not think I am one who can be helped. Is it possible to be beyond help?",0
"My life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 9 years now, ever since I permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium (European equivalent of high school).The injury is what started it all, but as time passed, my depression gradually grew into what it is today, in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury, but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse, they started seeping into every aspect of my life, until negative, downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.I no longer feel like I am actually living my life, it feels like I am just going through the motions, most days I just feel numb and I cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. But just to be clear, I have accepted that I do not have it in me to kill myself, but if I am going to continue living, I do not want to continue down the self destructive path I am on. As for the lying part. As of writing this, I am completely broke, on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and I was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years, I am actually happy that I do not have to study anymore, since enrolling was just a thing I did, mainly to have a community to be a part of, but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying, just added to it all.My family do not know any of this and I have been too scared to tell them all this, but now I have reached a point where I do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. Also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and I just cannot keep lying about it anymore, I cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart, that this is what my life has become. I am mainly considering telling them, because I have come to the conclusion that I cannot get out of this myself and that I need help. No matter what plans I make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing, as the crushing hopelessness of it all, makes it hard to must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens.I am not someone who usually discusses my feelings or emotional state with people, so any advice is much appreciated. I am considering just telling my family about my depression, so I do not have to lie about my life anymore.",0

I would agree that I was meant to be with him except for one problem: I am certain that I am going to snap and kms one day. I do love him and we do talk about our future together. It makes us both really happy, but secretly I feel so guilty deep down because I know its very likely that all those dreams are going to come crashing down when I snap and decide to get it done once and for all. We did talk about having kids but I am afraid I will pass on my mental issues (not sure if they are genetic or not because I was abused as a child for about a decade) and also I would hate to create whole new people and then crush them by killing myself AFTER they are born.

How can I help him? I would like to minimise emotional damage. We met on a dating app so maybe I could find him another gf or something. Or I could be such a bitch to him that he actually becomes happy at the thought of my death? Feeling GUILTY over potentially committing suicide, how can I help boyfriend?",1
"I mean why? I do not want to be suffered anymore, I do not want to be depressed, I do not want to make other people irritated and stressed..All I want is just ending my pain and leaving this terrible world. And also it will be much better for ppl around me when I leave. They will not be stressed or angry with me.I am useless and meaningless piece of shit. So I should die for everyone. If I keep leaving, everything will be much worse. Why I should live?",1
"I do not enjoy any aspect of life and the misery I feel continues getting worse without bound. I am a pretty terrible person. The only good thing I can say about me is I have a working moral compass because I know I am not following it. I know to stay silent about the truly horrible things I have done. Society wants nothing to do with me and society's instinct is correct, even though it is for the wrong reason. Every person who has given me a chance realized I was a terrible person and left me but most people assume I am a decent person but they just do not want to have anything to do with me. I want so badly to say everybody abandoned me but I do not feel cutting terrible people out of your life should count as abandoning someone. Let me explain to you how terrible a person I am. I had only attempted to end my life once before and literally nobody knows about it. Just so you know this is not a pattern of behavior. I contacted the only people who ever claimed to care for me before I tried ending things and they did not care. They left me long ago for how terrible I was, and they are kind, giving people who constantly put others before themselves but they do not care that I am ""dead"" at the moment (I should be dead and they for sure know that is the case but they do not care).The stupid thing is I have spent the last few years dramatically improving my life through therapy, medication and general self improvement but at the core of everything I am just a person I despise. The people who legitimately loved me realized how terrible i am while they only hady a surface level understanding of how awful I am and they decided to leave me to die. I have the full picture, and it is much uglier than the one the people who used to know me decided to remove from their life. So why would not I remove it from my life as well?Before they left me I had this idea that I could turn things around and ignore all the terrible things I have done but I legit hate everyone at this point. I felt like as long as my hatred was pointed inwards it was possible to redeem myself. I hate the people who left me. Other people's pain actively makes me feel good. I used not to be this way. Very recently I used not to be this way. A disaster would happen like 8 months ago and I would literally become so saddened by it that i could not get out of bed. Like, I would think of the Challenger disaster and just lie in bed depressed as fuck crying thinking about how terrible it was. Nowadays I feel like I am on the verge of literally masturbating when terrible things happen to people because it is such a pleasure to me. The kinder the person is who is hurt the more pleasure I feel. My ex-friends were very kind people and if they still knew me and something bad happened to them I do not think I could hold back from indulging in the satisfaction my hatred brings me. I was not a good person before people's suffering brought me delight but it is driven me towards being monstrous. And I am no exception. Terrible things happen to me is also a delight. I literally am begging for my world to fall apart.I am not sure what I hope to accomplish with this. I attempted the big deed recently and I removed all my accounts on everything but i could not delete this one because I do not remember the password so I signed out of it but it is still on my phone. I am signing out of this account on my phone once I finish writing here. I hope I am not around much longer. I think what I want to accomplish is to because someone to feel saddened by the pain I feel at this moment. I do not want help. If Reddit did not remove certain subreddits, I would be posting in a community that encouraged the actions I am planning.I am signing out of this account and I will not be able to respond to any interaction I get on here. I would actually discourage anyone from talking to me regardless. I do not understand why I am still around",1
"that is it. I do not have friends. My last friend got away from me when my depression got really bad last month. One by one drifted apart from me when I was suffering.I never had a meaning for any of them. I feel alone. I wish I could obsess over something and not care about being alone. But it hurts. I wish I had someone to talk about random stuff.I am on antidepressants right now and the dose was increased so I am feeling a little numb, not as depressed and suicidal as I was last week.I do not know what to do. I know no one is going to read this nor reply to this either. I do not even know why I am writing here. I am just crying for help. I do not have any friends",0
"Like, will they go trought your messages, photos, etc. When you call suicide hotline and police gets involved, will they go trought your phone?",1

i know everyone is putting themselves out there. man idk what I am doing anymore. anyone ever taking their antidepressant and drink. i barely started taking mine and idk. depressed and anxious.,0
"I wish I had a gun right, it would make it so easy. I would blow my fucking head off right now without hesitation. Why the fuck does it have to be so hard to get a gun? Why should I have to jump through hurdles and do a bunch of bullshit just so I can finally kill myself?They should just make suicide booths already. Why do they force people to live? Just make an easy, quick and painless way for suicidal people to kill themselves, I thought overpopulation was a problem anyway? No I do not want to fucking hang myself, that is a horrible way to die. Just give us an easy way out already. Why does it have to be so difficult?",1
"Below was the program my Registered Dietician and I worked on together. Best copay I ever spent.I am on day #31 today.

But so far it is been maintaining.*\*I wanted to share for those of us who are too depressed to cook, shop, get out of bed, etc. \*I should note I was looking to maintain weight at 12% body fat (male) with optimal nutrition taking 30 minutes total or less per day for everything (shopping, from vehicle to house, cooking, washing, drying, eating, drinking, trash, etc.). I read online that the average American spends 105.8 minutes per day on these tasks. I am at about 30 minutes a day.This has worked for me so far. Thought I would share. (and yes, I realize Aquafina water vs tap water could save a lot of money, but I wanted to easily measure ounces of water and thankfully I can afford $16.31 per day for everything nutrition combined. Plus I am too depressed for anything for washing/drying dishes.).I currently have no dishes to wash/dry everyday which is nice. Everything that is not (Fridge) can be thrown in my backpack. So it is very convenient for storage as well. I look forward to healthier blood panel results in 152 days time. Depression, but did visit Registered Dietician",0
"Throwaway for reasons that will become apparent.For some basic info about me, I (19M) have been diagnosed with MDD a little over 2 years ago after a suicide attempt. I am currently on lexapro and attending regular biweekly therapy sessions. Currently scheduled screening for ADHD as well.Recently I have not been feeling much of anything. I was not sure if it was the meds; I hear SSRIs and SNRIs have a high chance of causing numbness. But I am having doubts about that.Prior to about 6 months ago, I would regularly and deliberately inflict harm on the dog we have at our home (was my grandma's dog, bequeathed to my mom after my grandma passed). Methods of abuse include forcefully dragging, punching, dropping heavy objects on it, and throwing it. The dog has since been rehomed, and both my mom and therapist are aware of the problem. I did not feel any remorse for harming the dog, but felt some anxiety of being caught. I have not been diagnosed with ASD, any cluster B personality disorder, or conduct disorder.I do not tend to feel empathetic towards people. In fact, emotional people tend to annoy me. I have contemplated ASPD and CD being two possibilities for diagnoses but my therapist disagrees with both. This emotional numbness and difficulty empathizing interferes with my depression occasionally. It makes me think that I will live life forever as a robot, and that I could possibly be physically incapable of connecting with other people, and simply live through life as an unemotional, ostracized she will of a person. I would like to feel something, and I would like to connect with other people. My therapist sees this as a good sign; and stated that most sociopaths or psychopaths do not care about this.I am paranoid that the reason for my emotional numbness is more ""ingrained"" and innate, rather than being an issue caused by environmental factors. Rambling about what is on my mind",0
"Its been 8 months, iv been on dates, had sexual experiences with other girls and yet again I am sat in bed praying for to walk through that door just one more time to tell me she loves me.I have girls interested in me and want to be with me, but she was the love of my life and I fucked it up.If there is a god. Hes ruined my life. I will not ever forget you Nat. she is moved on and I will not ever",0
Speaking from personal experience I think the hardest part about depression is that you do not want help. Not really. You have to learn that you are worth the help and not push it away..which is hard:/,0
"So an old friend invited me to his farewell party, I normally do not get invites like this but he was going away to another country, to be honest we were never that close because we went to different Universities but I get along well with him. It was a dinner party and there were about 12 people there most were female friends of his girlfriend and like 3 guys, the whole night I felt so zoned out, I felt horrible that I was not being friendly or talking to the others but I felt so faded, the alcohol made it even worse. One of the guys remarked how I barely talked to anyone the whole night, I felt crushed, I gave the usual a xcuse of I am tired but it was difficult not to leave right away. I was the first to leave it felt like I was giving up officially, I came home and cried.. yeah a 22yr old dude cried after a party, I feel like I am just a loser and no matter how much I force myself I will always be a loser, I give up even trying anymore I am tired of it. I cannot even hang out with people, I feel like a broken person",0
"I am so sick of opening my phone and seeing that I did not get any notifications, I am tired of people ignoring me, I am tired of people not responding to me. It makes me feel like I am not deserving of peoples time and attention why do not ppl take 5 seconds out of their day to respond to me?????? why am I so unimportant to everyone I hate that every single fucking time I talk to my mom she starts yelling at me or finds a way to turn it into an argument. I am so tired of my siblings treating me like I am background noise, they do not listen to me, they pay attention to their phones rather than what I am saying. Its like they just straight up do not listen to me when I am talking. How am I supposed to get more social if no one likes or respects me? I can never talk about how I feel with anyone because I do not have a therapist or any friends so I just keep my emotions bottled up all day or I just try to turn my emotions off. This is very bad because some days (like today) when I am so tired of everything I explode and I am full of negative emotions. Today I made a joke to my sister and she just said That was not funny. Even though I clearly just enjoyed telling her. I did not say anything else after that but I was really mad in my head. So I told our family group chat that I am sick of them ignoring me all the time and being mean to me for no reason and that I do not want to talk to them anymore. I regret doing that so much because guess what happened? No seriously guys take a wild guess :( they completely ignored how I feel Now they probably think I am a sensitive drama queen. I feel 100 times worse. I feel like I completely overreacted, btw I was not exactly mad because she called me unfunny, ofc I do not expect everyone to laugh at my jokes but I just do not like the fact that she is just so casually mean to me all the time if that makes sense. I do not want to force anyone to be nice to me but like cmon ppl I am a human being too. I did not write this because I want anyone to sympathize for me or pity me lol I just needed a place to vent srry I feel like I do not even exist, I am just here for no reason and I am sick of being ignored",0
"My husband does a good job letting me know that not everything is about me and the world does not revolve around me and how I feel. I told him I am doing my best, I am taking medication and working on myself so I stay out of his way and let him relax and focus on work. He says everyone is doing their best at life. He also does a good job pushing me away. That I am kind of scared of him now and do not see myself reaching out to him for emotional support any longer. He used to be really sweet. I usedTo be everythingTo him. Now lately I have been feeling like his punching bag.I told himThese things but he did not react or apologize or try to make anything better. ImJust really sad. I have no one. Not everything is about you",0
"I have to deal with chronic pain and sometimes I use drugs for pain relief. I am already sad I have chronic pain but after I get high and come down I feel flat, emotionless and it is just an uncomfortable numbness. I have been valuing my sobriety lately, the antidepressants seem to help with that. I can quit drugs but I would have to find other ways to cope with chronic pain. I have been taking the middle road and just smoking weed about twice a week, drinking lots of coffee daily, and finding other ways to cope with pain. Looking forward to getting high and alleviating pain and depression for a day gives me a goal and a reward but now it is increased the uncomfortable numbness. Now I am just drinking coffee to avoid caffeine withdrawals and it does not boost my mood like it used to. I just want a healthy relationship with drugs, I need something better than abstinence or addiction and I just have not found it yet. Life seems to be telling me it is one or the other. Things can spiral when I live in a delicate equilibrium",0
And I am not sacrificing my entire existance on this planet to work. Its so expensive to live we might as well just die,1
I have been struggling with feeling like I am drowning lately then out of nowhere my marriage crumbled today. All day I have fought suicidal thoughts. I wanted to talk to my spouse about watching our children for a few days while I seek help. Before that conversation could get started he told me he wished my attempt last year had been successful. Why am I still trying to live? Feeling lost,1

"I feel embarassed because i just posted on here last night but I am desperate. My boyfriend just broke up with me. 7 months of i love yous down to drain overnight. I am so in love with him and I cannot do it. I told my mom and she said I need to feel my emotions but let it go so I can focus on school. We broke up 9 hours ago. 9 hours and all I am to my mom is an opportunity to brag. My emotions do not matter. Nobody cares about me. I cannot close my eyes because i can feel him kissing and caressing my face. I cannot sleep because i can feel him next to me. I cannot do anything because everything reminds me of him. I feel so dumb. I am hoping for a miracle that will not come. I was deep in my depression before we got together and it feels like all 7 months are tumbling down on top of me and I feel like shit. I love him. So much. So fucking much. I do not know what happens after death. that is what kept me alive for so long. My fear of what happens after death saved me so many times; but right now I really do not know if it can. I want to stop hurting. I want to get away from my responsibilities. I hope that after death there is some way I can at least imagine we are still together, and I do not have to worry about school, or careers, or anything. I do not want to feel this way anymore. I want help more than anything and I am starting to not be scared and I really do not know how much more of this I can do. I cannot make it.",1
"it is been a bad year for me, it started back in December when I ruined my relationship and lost my job, but I kept going. I had a new job the next week and I was going through the motions, staying busy. Then in February I had an accident at work and I have not been the same since. I have been to multiple doctors visits and lots of physical therapy but I am still not better. My job offered me a ""light duty"" position (sitting in a corner alone staring at a wall) and I did that for a few months hoping I would get better. I have not healed, I am still going through physical therapy and I feel useless. About a month and a half ago I gave up, I stopped going to work and I have probably left my house maybe 5 times for supplies other than that I have been in bed. I have no motivation to get anything done, I have no drive. This is all new to me, I do not feel anything really. I am not sad, I just have never been one to not do anything I have been active my whole life. I am not sure what this is, idk how to snap myself out of this and get back on track. Sometimes it hits me hard and I see what I have become but for the most part I am completely numb. I am going to end up homeless soon if I do not get it together, bills are piling up but even that will not motivate me. Idk if I am even posting in the right sub or not, I just had to get this out. I am not sure but I think I may be depressed",0
"Its finally hit me that I am growing up and I cannot just have fun and do whatever I want anymore. I have always been smart , have a loving functional family, a safe home, my life is good. My life is great, its beautiful. But that is it. I have become nothing. Every year I grew older I lost more and more. I do nothing but sleep or draw all day. My room is full of dust and bugs. I am good for nothing. And tbatse fine because I do not want to do anythingeryrhinf around me is beautiful but my mind is so fucking ugly and its going to tear me apart Just turned 16, I feel like my life is already over but it will not end , so I have to do it myself",1
"everything just feels so futile. i do not even really know what else to say. everything feels like nothing matters, and i feel like there is nothing i can do to change it. maybe if i was, i guess, fundamentally a different person i could try and say that it is good that everything feels like nothing - that feeling like nothing matters is empowering actually, because that means i can do whatever i want and not feel self conscious. I am not a fundamentally different person, though, and that is the issue, you know?you know that part in *it is Such a Beautiful Day*, where the narrator says, ""Bill awoke to beautiful sunlight streaming through his window. He tried to climb through it, but did not have the strength to stand,"" and then the part later where the narrator says, ""he is been having trouble sleeping again, and realizes he is lying in the dark with his eyes open.""i feel like I am constantly watching the sun through my window, but i do not even have the will to try and climb to it. i feel like always just laying in bed with the lights off and my eyes open, waiting for sleep that will not come, so why should i hope i fall asleep? resistance is futile. i could just let myself starve in my bed. i wish i could die without feeling guilty. i know my parents and brothers would be too sad if i died, so i cannot. not right now, at least. like Nabokov said about : ""At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom. or, like Mainlnder said, ""Life is hell, and the sweet still night of absolute death is the annihilation of hell."" it is like there is no point in having hope anymore",1
I have been battling health issues and have yet to get a diagnosis despite so much money and time spent on tests. My young dog just passed over lymphoma. I could go on and on but I feel like things just keep piling up. I realize I am not special and there is millions of people with worse problems. But what this is life? Trying our best to stay afloat and pretending we are enjoying any of it? I feel like at this point I am only alive because I could not handle knowing I made any of my loved ones upset. it is just as of late with so much continuing to happen it seems even harder. I have battled depression and suicidal thoughts since I started anorexia when I was 10. I am now about to be 26. I am likely going to battle it the rest of my life and it is so exhausting to think about. I am sometimes jealous of those alive during the time when life expectancies were so low. I know I probably sound ridiculous and I am sorry. It just seems so pointless sometimes. It takes so much effort,1
"When I look at photos of myself before my depression, I had a fuller face and a glow. This was 4 years ago before a horrible breakup. Today I look in the mirror and my eyes are hollow, my face is slimmer, everything kind of droops and my gaze is completely lifeless. I am just so defeated and I look like a completely different person. I cannot find any good before/after pictures on Google for depression. Basically, I am wondering: Is beauty gone after aging + depression? Or will life after depression give me back my attractiveness/handsomeness? Will I wear these scars forever? I feel like I have wasted my looks which makes it even harder to get out of this shit. Effects on face: does it get better again?",0
"I guess i need a place to write this, even if its unseen. That being said, nothing helps. Just straight up, talking to people, food, friends, alcohol, nothing. I feel so selfish for feeling alone because i have a few decent friends but i know due to my lack of real personality traits and crushing depression I cannot even offer that much to anyone. I am just so sad, I am so tired of feeling useless, i cannot live much longer only leaving my bed to go to a job that makes me feel empty. I want a friend so bad who just gets it but i just get abandoned every time Nothing helps lol",0

"I do not know why I am posting this, especially on my main account, whether it is to find comfort with potentially like-minded people, to just throw it out into the anonymous void that is the internet, or just to vent further but I truly feel in my heart if I had a gun or maybe a rope, just some means where I KNOW I would be dead while also not risking the lives of other people like I potentially would be if I jumped off the nearest bridge, I would be gone. My urge is strong, stronger than it is ever been, I feel hopeless and unable to get help, but I have also failed enough in life and the last thing I want to do is fail at ending it too.I used the Lifeline Chat, and I know some people have had bad experiences with both the hotline and the chat, but I do think the person I got was trying to help as best they could, and maybe I will try to use the resources they presented me with to try and get on the road to recovery, I just do not know what that road even is anymore nor where it might take me.I guess the Sticky Notes version of my life is: Grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family. Mom died young, after I graduated, and it messed me up, Dad developed Dementia and I was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until I finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home. Pretty isolated from the rest of the family with few remaining friends. I was in a good position at work I guess but my life is literally my miserable job then nothing else meaningful and I am finding it harder to tough through my mental blocks and have been missing work, dying up my bank account and am close to homeless. I truly do not know nor understand what exactly is wrong with me. No car (Never learned to actually drive) and have to walk everywhere. Therapy would cost money but juggling therapy with my job so I could afford it seems impractical in my position. Maybe I am just too lazy to make it work? I dunno. I could go on but feel I have rambled long enough.Thanks for reading... Whatever this is. If I had a gun right now, I would be dead.",1
"I put this together while sobbing so hard I almost made myself vomit last night. I had a pounding headache, had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. The lain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself; I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. It reads.Dear K,I wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So, I have to let you be happy. That is what I want, because I love you so much. I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you. When I was young, I learned the word for always in French: *toujours.* It always sounded like a beautiful, graceful, yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy, sentimental, but genuine and strong. you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart. I promise. I love you so much. I have written a few different suicide notes to I am going to send people when I do it. This is the one that is going to the girl I am in love with.",1
"You know that episode of Bojack Horseman when Bojack shows up to Diannes book convention thing? And he starts asking her if its too late for him? He goes on asking if she thinks hes destined to be that person that was in the book and if its too late for him to be a good person. That scene just really got to me and i just want to go to my ex wife and ask her the same thing. But she wants nothing to do with me, every time i try to contact her she just pushes me away. I understand, i hurt her and she should be mad at me. She should not want anything to do with me. But i iust need her to tell me I am not a bad person. I need her to tell me its going to be okay. I just need her to tell me she does not hate me. I never thought i could be so broken but the thought that life gave you your one real opportunity to be happy and you ruined it... that is enough to make anyone shatter. I cannot tell her all this so i came here, thanks for being an outlet. Bojack horseman",1
"My family has given me so much, but also taken away so much more than that. I cannot even lie down on my bed in self-pity for thirty minutes without people shouting at each other, and then treating me like they are the only one with problems, and never allowing me the freedom to express my sorrows. My outer family probably thinks I am someone who has had life too easy, and honestly, they are probably right in many ways. I love most of my friends, but I can never talk to them about my personal life, because I have built a facade of being an emotionless goofball. Even moments where I stay quiet for more than five minutes are enough for people to assume something is not going right with me, so how can I ever tell them what is really going on?My co-workers think I am pleasant and nice, but probably assume my personality is non existent. I am in line to have terrific job prospects once I graduate, yet I could not care less. Even after a post-puberty transformation that makes me a fairly decent looking person, I have never had a girlfriend, largely due to the insecurities I have maintained through my puberty years, when I was flat out ugly. Dating sites have horrible response rates, and even if I feel like there is a good conversation going, I always end up getting ghosted.there is also the fact that I am non-binary and in the closet, but cannot see a reality where I am able to love this part of myself, have a loving partner embrace me for who I am, or accepted my by family.I feel incredibly silly even writing this, because of how much privilege I have had through my life. I do not think I will ever end up taking my own life, because I am too much of a coward, and it would crush everyone I know, yet no one knows anything about who I really am. Yet I think about it everyday... when I wake up, after work, when I am with my friends, going to bed, you name it. Seriously, why the hell do I have to exist? Just let me disappear",1

"And it is funny how that works. They need, you pay or else. You need, you can get fucked and die. Who cares. Scam ass society. Only way out with peace of mind is death. Nobody seems to care that you are not really there, until you owe them money.",0
"I am just tired of it all. Were it not for a few bright things and people in my past I would have been gone a long time ago. I make the same mistakes. I feel invisible when I am not feeling like a burden. I have been able to feel love longer than I can remember. I feel unrepairable. . It physically and emotionally hurts to live. I moved to a different country to start a new life. Tiny things improved, but in the end I am just defective. I am not meant to be anything more than I am. Years and years have proven that.&amp;#x200B;I just want to sleep. 40 yrs old. Tired. Failed 3 attempts in the past.",1
I am so broken. I have not stopped crying since my everything died. I am so scared for the future. I do not want to live another day on Earth without her. I could die 20-30 years from now and I feel if there is a heaven or an afterlife where you can just exist with other spirits will she find someone new. I do not even want to find someone new on Earth because she has my heart forever. I know its a stupid thought but I just wonder. An afterlife,1
"I feel like my friends only talk to me because they feel bad for me but secretly hate me. These past few days have been me feeling sad and empty, and i cannot fucking take it anymore. I feel like a complete burden to anybody I have ever talked to, and i bet the world would be better off without me. Anyone feel the same way i do? I feel like a burden to the world.",0
I have fucked up too much. I am always an issue. Nothing is fulfilling anymore unless I am drunk or fucked up. I hate it. I feel sick with myself. I cannot stand myself,1
"I am currently working 10min (walk) from home, so I walk there everyday. The thing is, I am back at my grandma's in a small city in Brazil and here there are soooo many stray dogs and cats on the streets, at least half of them in awful conditions, looking like they are about to die at any moment (either too skinny or with a lot of ugly bruises).I have to see that everyday, therefore I cry everyday and want to end this everyday, 4 times a day (the street I walk to have lunch has the worst dog of them all, he is barely breathing, supper skinny and there is nothing I can do). I lived here when I was a teen and it was so hard. When I moved out I was so relieved to leave all of this hurt behind, but now I am back, and details aside, I cannot really leave.Does anyone have any suggestions for me to feel less like shit being that:- I cannot help them because I am goddamn poor and barely have time and money for my sick cat at home.- I cannot quit my job.- there is no way to get to work without bumping into those poor creatures and relieving my trauma.- I will only be able to afford therapy by September.it is hard and I do not see any solution, I am actually skeptical about anyone helping me with some kind of idea/solution, but I do not really see an alternative, I am hoping for the best. Feel suicidal daily and cannot really change things in order to be ok right now. Wonder if there is anything I can do to feel better even if I am in a shitty situation, can someone help?",1
I am in my 4th year of college with 3 more miserable years to go if I decide to keep up with school. Last semester I had a nervous breakdown and gave up on my classes and now I have all Ws to show for it.I have worked only fast food jobs for 4 years and my latest job is El Pollo Loco where I work 8 hrs shifts with 40 mins worth of break for the entire day. Its tiring work.I mean I feel so fucking low compared to everyone else. How does anyone fucking go on living? How do you people get up every day?,0
"I know there is a top post about this already, but I wanted to write to hopefully get this off my chest. Life just seems completely meaningless, like there is nothing to live for. I am surrounded by people. People are fucking everywhere. I have lots of friends and possibilities to do just ""something"" are endless, but they all seem meaningless. I know what I live for, but when I cannot make any progress and any and all entertainment seems pointless, I just do not know what to live for. The feeling in itself is meaningless, because I know there is no intrinsic meaning to be found, so why is it there? I know it is triggered by boredom and loneliness, but only two days ago I was with my family the whole day. I did not speak to anyone yesterday or today, but I do not feel like that is very long at all. I should be able to entertain myself but how..... Life seems meaningless",0
"""you are depressed."" The online test told me. I did not know if I should have took it with a grain of salt or took it seriously. Was I honest? Maybe not. Repeatedly going back to a question, thinking if it does happen or not. ""Happy."" No, I would not say I am. I regret many things in my life, I have cried at least once a week. I cannot sleep. I do not know my passion. ""Prove them wrong!"" How do you prove someone wrong when most of your life was dictated by them? And here you are, still alive. ""Be yourself."" Who are you to tell me to be myself when you do not know who I am? Being myself has many consequences.""it is reality."" Reality is often dictated by people who is dreams have failed, projecting their wishes to make sure their children are stable - rather than helping that child to do their love for something to the best of their ability.""Your skin is not paper, do not cut it."" Taking me as a fool, like everyone else. I know it is not paper. I know I should not cut it. But where else can I project my hatred for myself than to weigh it onto me physically?""I am proud of you."" I am not.""There is hope."" I know, but that hope is far far away, and I have to make the effort. I just want to run from my worries and problems, not face them and let them crush me.I hate me. I hate who I have become. I hate who I have been. I hate what I could have been but never became. Sometimes, I invalidate my depression.",0
I am willing to listen to anyone vent about their suffering. Chat me and I will give you a call. Anybody need to vent?,1
"I cannot do the shit that I was put here to do, I do not fill any traditional role, I do not give a shit about anything that is moral or decent in this world and I just do not want to play the game anymore while some people are born in fucking luxury and can spend their lives doing whatever the fuck they want. The shit is rigged. I always say I am going to change my life around then I fucking do not. I just cannot do it Whole game of life is some bullshit",1
"It does not make me mad at the people, its more like I just get really jealous. I wish I could just live in the moment, but its impossible to do when I am to busy hating everything about myself. I hate seeing everyone else happy",0
"Does anyone else feel like they are fighting something invisible? Actually it is depression, loneliness, apathy things that we do not see but that affect us more than physical damage, we simply cannot stop thinking about it but we have to fight and keep fighting until we win the enemy is strong but does not exist we are more stronger than we think. Struggle",1
"My father thinks I am a freak and wants me to kill myself.My mother is disappointed that I turned out like this.I get daily comments from my brother; shit like you will never be a man, its just a phase, you do not have a dick and balls do that means you are a girl, you are so dumb/delusional you think you are a guy etc etc. they are so ashamed of me that they refuse to let me come out to my extended family, they even wanted me to not tell my friend but of course I did not listen. I get misgendered and deadnamed daily, not just by my family but by people at school, I have already been threatened to be killed for being trans by some guy. I was lied to for so long, my parents told me that they would love me no matter who I become but its all a fucking lie because I am not the perfect cishet mentally stable daughter they wanted; instead they got a fucked up trans faggot son. I could of turned out to be some serial killer and they would of preferred that over me being trans. If my family want me to hurry up and die already they just need to say so; I know exactly where a train is and Ill gladly sit down on the rail roads. I mean my father has already told me to go kill myself but Ill listen to what he says if he tells me to kms again (or anyone else in my family says to). None of them bother to listen to me so at this point Ill need to kill myself to prove that my gender dysphoria is real and that their words have consequences. Ffs my mother tried to gaslight me into believing that I was not trans when I came out to her. I doubt Ill make it to see 2022 and to be honest, I hope I do not; I am so sick of this shit. What tf did I do to deserve this kind of torture? Why could not I just be born normal? I am cursed with gender dysphoria and an unsupportive family (FTM)",1
"I do not know why I am writing this. I do not know why it is like this. Years feel like loops of emotion. when it is winter i can feel emotion, they are usually negative but at least it is something. But when it is summer, or around summer it is like i cannot feel any emotion. When i think back to times where i know i was happy, i do not feel what i felt. The only thing i feel is my heart racing. I cannot stand it. The worst thing is i can escape it because when i lack the emotion i cannot even stand to think about death. Out of emotion",0
"So here is how I am going. I have been doing terrribly mentally, I do not have a job a currently, I am 26 years old. trying to find one. I play video games to try and escape, same with shows, playing with my pet and cooking. everything I used to enjoy has stopped being enjoyable. I play a game of smite and I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown even if I win. I am miserable constantly I do not want to stay in bed all day because I want a job. but I have been doing customer service since i was 18. and saying I am sick of it is an understatement I would rather die at this point then talk to another customer about coupons. I am severely overweight, have health issues and am ugly. I have the lowest self esteem possible, I hate everything about myself. all I think about is dying every day. I cannot handle any sort of bad news anymore. I am not sure what is entirely wrong with me. but this mental prison I have myself in is a type of hell. I need to find a way out or I am not going to last alot longer. to go into why i feel like this would be mostly about my past and I will not go into that. very long story, but not having a job to help support myself and having my friends help while I do not have one stresses me out to the point to where I am not sleeping more than maybe 3 hours a day, I am exhausted all the time. I just do not know what to do anymore. how do i ask for help when i do not even know what is wrong? My mental health is deteriorating",0
"I have been seeing this girl off and on since the start of the pandemic (M43). I wanted a relationship, but she was going through a nasty separation and she did not. For the past six months, we have been going out as friends, and I was ok with that. We were supposed to go out right before July 4th and she cancelled last minute. I got upset because I was really looking forward to it and she had a habit of cancelling last minute. I got upset and she stopped communication with me. She said she was busy, and she probably was, but I keep running scenario after scenario through my head of what was going wrong.I have struggled with depression for almost 30 years and have never been able to seek treatment. I have come to the conclusion that this is why I cannot start any meaningful relationship. it is the self doubt and self sabotage that prevents me rounding the corner. I sent her a long text confessing my depression to her and telling her that all I wanted was for her to try and understand what I am going through. I emphasized that our relationship would never be the same and that the only other person who knows about my condition is my doctor. We had constant contact almost every day for the past year and half. She was going through a nasty custody battle with her ex husband, and I was there for her. I was hoping she would be there for me. Instead, she has blocked me on every social media platform and my number. It would have met so much to me if she tried to understand, but she cut me off. I am so embarrassed and feel so low. I just want someone to show me some compassion! Now she must think I am a creep.The only good news is that I have made an appointment with a therapist for next month. I feel so low and embarrassed right now",0
"I have a noose ready in my closet. I do not know when to do it, I do not want to hurt my family, but I do not want to keep suffering. I do not know what to do. I cannot tell anyone I am suicidal",1
"Male in my mid going on later 30s. As context i spent my 20s dating and then pining after the one that got away who was my only girlfriend thus far. Then i let myself go and got really obese and just did not think about relationships for a while. I have tried improving myself, I make a six figure income, i travel the world, i dropped the weight so I am no longer obese. Paid for microneedling to remove acne scars.. and nothing despite trying every dating app. I even went on sites like SA to see if i could pay for companionship and still nothing. I share my picture and get ghosted. Its quite the hit to ones psyche. And I have been putting myself out there for over a year at this point. I have definitely had thoughts of just giving up and resigning myself to being alone for the rest of my life but that has cascaded into some fairly dark ""what is the point of it all"" notions in my head that id rather not contemplate again. So i get myself up and try again each day knowing its probably going to go on like the last :/ I am sure this is fairly common to some extent, but I have been getting reallg low more frequently because i think I am goibg to die alone with no kids",0
"i have serious issues, I have been seriouslyself harming (cutting) for a really long time and now i just cannot handle my suicidal thoughts.

"I am extremely depressed at home, I am 24 living at home, cannot leave house unless its for work purposes. my mom constaltly calls me a whore, she mentally and physically abuses my dad who is the sole breadwinner. I am thinking of contemplating either moving out when i save up 20k which is in abt 5 months from now or searching for a job(other than the one i have now, cannot stick to it bc mother will stalk me here) and starting to plan to move out (ill have abt 8k when i move out if i start planning now). What do you guys think therapy is of no help its truly my living conditions that is making me suicidal. sometimes its fine i do not have freedom so what i can just play games, but then i get triggered when my mom calls me a whore in an extremly mentally abusive way that i get suicdal. i may be at my breaking point I am experiencing back pain, heart aches, a lot of suicdal thoughts.so should i move out now (will have approx 8k ) or wait till i have 20k(5 months frm now) Please read and help me",1
"I have written so many words and lengthy cathartic monologue's to myself over the years that they are not really cutting it anymore. The words I use are old and they do not quite cover my feelings anymore. I have watched everyone surprass me. I have been used up and discarded more times than I care for at this point. I have nothing but the storm of hate and despair that I feel all the time now. I am so angry and so lost. I have no hope and I have exhausted most of my options of self-help. I can always continue and always survive, but I am not really progressing and I am not really becoming what I want to become. I cannot get a job, I have been denied University funding, my wife did not want me and I am stuck in my childhood home of abuse. I cannot seem to make money online anymore and those options are few anyway. I have used up all the limited help there is and I do not really see a way to proceed anymore. I am thinking that perhaps it is time and maybe it will finally be a relief rather than a regret. it is sad, but it is what it is. I think the greatest illusion I ever sold myself is that I was going to be successful. The potential was there, but it was too stacked against me and I guess I am not strong enough. At 33 with no income and no accomplishments other than small personal goals, I think it might be time to just accept defeat. The path grows darker",1
"I have been going through a bad depressive episode through the past month or so... I have just found out my dad is going to lose his job and that my boss has been thinking of firing me for the past few weeks because I am lazy and not hardworking, even though I have been trying to work harder through the depression. I cannot help but feel how badly i want this pain to end, every night i lay in my bed wishing there was an easy way for me to make it all stop and end this suffering. I do not want to hurt anymore, i know there is other solutions that take time, but i cannot help wanting to end it all, I am so tired of trying and pushing and no one recognises or respects how far I have grown and pushed through to be 'successful'...but it does not matter at all, peoples perceptions and thoughts wound me and i languish over them for so long, everything hurts and every decision i make is never good enough....i just wish i had someone i could rely on for support....no one is really there for me through everything.....people are there here and there, but as soon as things get really bad i have no one i can talk to or rely on. I just want the pain to end, so badly....i do not want to keep pushing and face what the next day will throw at me to knock me down, I am tired of getting up everytime to be smacked back down hard again without anyone to be there or help me.I am so tired of everything and i do not know how to stop wanting to end it all in a moment. Struggling",1
"(20M) Mannnn after a few years of giving/getting no contact or stimulation with a girl, I have kind of been on some loner shit. I have always been a quiet/shy guy except when I am w some friends lol. But their either in military or strict parents, small friend group. Is it bad I feel like this? Am I an incel? I do enjoy being outside, but after getting my first car and then blowing my engine 2 months later its like well fuck it. Having that car was my world, BMWs smh. Main root is the fact I crave intimacy, despite living in a small college town. Is it wrong that I crave intimacy?",0
"I just want to end this miserable life but I am scared of what is beyond after death and what happened to our consciousness once we die. I hope its just nothing and not pure hell or some religious bs, but still cannot do it despite the fact dying is much preferable than this kind of living... (although if hell exist cannot blame god for putting me in it since I deserve it anyways) Tried hanging but scared of what comes after",1
"I will try to make this short. I have terrible social anxiety and depression. I am addicted to Xanax but have not used since February. My parents just today found out I will be obtaining more very soon. They do not like this because of the issues its caused when used improperly. we have had a rough few years because of this aspect of things. I abused it and caused a real shit show for everyone. My social anxiety is the reason I have no friends and no real relationships besides my close family. I am non functioning. I need the right dose of a benzo to be functional. In response to finding my plan out, my mother cancelled my government subsidized phone plan, changed the wifi password, and told me I need to be out in a week. My mental health is fucking terrible and I have already wanted to die for a while, but have never been willing to go all the way. Now that life is going to be x100 harder than it already is I just cannot continue on. I am currently changing clothes at least a couple times a day due to anxiety sweating. What am I going to do homeless, just sit in my own puddle? Life is miserable already. Throw homelessness in and it is complete hell. I am done trying. At soon as I am on the streets, I am going to go buy a few fentanyl pills, then go into the woods and take a bunch of Xanax and then the fentanyl. it will be like going to sleep. I truly believe I will finally be happy when I am dead. it will be like a weight lifted off my shoulders. going to be homeless, I am done",1
"My original language is not EnglishI feel to embarrassed to write it on a forum in my own country.I am really into strapon porn and light humiliation.I occasionally order a bottle of poppers and go at it on femdom porn, I usually trow the bottle away afterwards because I am disgusted.I am active at prostitute websites and go hunting for prostitutes that off kinky services.It goes on and on like this, femdom porn and prostitutes. People around me think I am gay.I once had a girlfriend and sex and the femdom urges went away.I am not bad looking but to insecure to date, I am 35 and I need to get a girlfriend or wife.Today I paid a prostitute to use my own strapon on me, she only did it for the money, but she looked at me with a weird look on her face.One hour later I went to another prostitute and did the same.It was really stupid because I better could go to a pro domme, but I was to horny.I do not know if I just need this type of sexual activities or I have a real problem.I go to a psychologist to talk, but I do not really think she gets these issues. Depressed about my sexual circle",0
"**trigger warning**I sought treatment for my depression and anxiety a year and a half ago. Ever since I have not needed medication as even though I had depressing thoughts, I could handle them better. Id still and still do have suicidal thoughts of an accident occurring and me no longer being on this earth. It would make life better for everyone including myself. I want to see my nephews grow up and my first nephews ultrasound is the one who kept me from going through with almost 3 years ago. I wanted to be there for him and have his aunt around. Now that hes never seeming to want me around anymore after a year of living with and babysitting him (moved out 2 months ago), I have been really wondering how much better off he would be had I followed though with my plans back then.I do my normal drive and think how easy it would be to swerve my car as if I was dodging a deer and try to end my life on accident. How on rainy days I can speed and because my car to hydroplane off a road into a ditch.I hate having less control of these thoughts and I do not want to bother my family because they do not understand and my friends have so much on their own plates I do not want to add on. I am hoping that maybe writing here will help. I am sure if I saw a therapist it would help me but have not looked for one since before covid.Sorry for the rant but I just do not know what else to do since its been so long since wanted to act on these thoughts. Thanks for reading I still have those thoughts",0

"hi,my name is not important.i am and have been since childhood severely deppressed.my psychologist told me that medication is the only way for my mental health, which is not an option for me since i live in iran and cannot afford it...which has the lowest money value in the world.and the jobs (if lucky enough to find any) pay so little that i cannot afford anything good.since i was a child at the age of 7 till 11 i was sexualy abused and was threatened for it.while being physically abused (being beaten) by bigger brother and mother that was so bad i often feared for my life.right now with my english skills and video editing skills I am lucky enough to have a job from home where i can translate and edit videos for a payment that equals to 25 us dollars per month.not to make it political but...iran is a dictatorship.where if you are lgbt they kill you. if you protest they kill you. if you are an atheist they also kill you.and right now there are power outages everyday that last maybe 2 or 4 hours a day.so my editing and translation job is screwed up too.i have had 2 suicide attempts ( pills and cutting my wrist )both failed because i am a pathetic loser who cannot do anything.right now my mother has left the house and i am alone with my father, so i cook everyday.and everyday that passes by.i just feel afraid, alone, suicidal, hopeless, stressed, and having constant nightmares.in my entire life there has not been a happy moment.i honestly do not have the smallest clue on how i can stop myself from suicide. i hate life so much.",0

"Exactly what the title says. Hollow and grey on the inside. do not have a single soul to express how i truly feel. I am 18 turning 19 in a week. Wish i never existed but with my luck.. I just had to be the one motherfuckin sperm that actually gets to the egg. Built this girl a whole brand new basement, got to know her really well, and even had her mom fall in love with me, and things were going great.. until she chose another man over me. that is okay i do not expect a damn thing from anybody. Nobody owes me shit. At least the very temporary company helped comfort my pain so slightly. Stuck working a back breaking job (general contractor) for my pops company. Underpaid as hell. Others my age are doing much less work and making much more money. Already got bad lower back pain at 18. Its all cool, hes my pops and i understand that I need to sacrifice some things. starting my second year of university in september (studying supply chain management). Forced to go to school solely because of my mom. Its okay, i guess ill get the degree to make her happy. First year was nothing due to covid. I also study the highest level of professional day trading education possible. I value lifting and being healthy so I incorporate the gym about 5-6x a week. its hard doing all this with nobody whatsoever. I pray and ask Jesus the Lord himself if he would just please bring a women in my life in his name and grace. Its sad to say it, but I just do not know if he answers my prayers. Nobody cares about me man, I feel alienated from human society. everything is bottled in, I am so stressed out that I got vitiligo. All i do is slave and work all damn day and it feels like nothing is progressing or getting accomplished. I am broke, broken, lonely, sad, hurt, angry, fragile. Trying my hardest to battle this. its so difficult man. Its all sinking in; Her picking another man over me, My friends ditching me for no reason, Running this damn contracting business with just my dad, literally not another soul (brutal back work), Being broke as fuck even tho it feels like I am working 16 hours a day. Trying to get the stock trading down so I do not lose my back and my dad at 21. Lifes pressuring me man. Just want a damn hug. Just seems like I put everyone else happiness first, and I finish last. I am praying for a sign, I am praying God turns my life around. I have officially hit rock bottom man. Goodnight, hopefully tomorrow is a good day in the markets so I can hopefully retire without a herniated disc. I have nobody. sad lonely and hurt",0
"My long term partner broke up with me a few months ago but we still live together and I thought I was handling things well but our housing contract is about to end, were going our separate ways and I am contemplating suicide seriously. I do not know who to speak to or what to do I just want to die. Nothing means anything anymore. I feel so worthless. I have completely supported the other person move on from breaking up with me but not processed any of it myself. We have only been together 5 years but they were my entire universe and I was not expecting it. I have invested so much and genuinely thought it would last forever and believed them when they told me it would.I have been stupidly hoping things would resolve because we started having sex again and acting like a couple but they no longer care about me. They have totally moved on. They told me today they did not care if I lived or died from coronavirus as long as I did not give it to them. I want to go to the river near my house and just fall into it forever. I do not want to be here anymore. I do not want to live. Other people deserve my resources on this planet I am fucking done.

My friends except for two have distanced themselves, so I do not have them either. My family constantly asks when I am going to do somthing with my life and it is just a wreck.

I am so scared to fall asleep because my mind wonders for that 15 minutes of trying to fall asleep before I actually do. I hate hearing my thoughts. They are so mean to me.

"Everyday I see people just doing the same thing but not making any changes. I watch obese people walking into fast food joints. People just walking on this treadmill of work, spend money, sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here. I think I just have to go to Africa for a few months and be around my people. I realized that living in th US makes me depressed and I do not believe I fit in here",0
I do not amount to anything. I struggle to find meaning for my existence. I want to do something but i am to weak. I feel hopeless. I am just leeching off life and not doing anything. It is like i was born to suffer. People always expect me to be happy for what i have but what is it worth if i do not make myself do anything with it? I feel like everyone is better than me and i hate it. I also hate that i might deserve this suffering. Some people just except that life is like that and they were born that way but it angers me.why me? I feel like skeletal remains of my past potential and i will continue to regret and never stop. Why am i so useless,0
I have no one to hang out with and no one to go to fun events with. Its so hard to describe this crushing loneliness I feel like death because I am all alone,0
"I am doomed to suffer forever, there is no way out I am stuck I am trapped",0
"the only reason i have not killed myself is because i believe there is nothing after death and I am afraid that it will not be any sort of peace since you have to exist to feel peace and I am terrified that the last thing I feel will be what i feel for eternity. but all i think about is suicide. I have zero passion or motivation, my brain is a constant fog, i cannot even force myself to move my body half the time, if it were not for my parents i would be homeless in a ditch somewhere. i cut off all my friends and isolated myself, the idea of being around people is unpleasant to the point of excruciating. And terrifying. I am too anxious to be around anyone. I have been self isolated for almost 2 years and I have forgotten how to socialize. I use alcohol sometimes when I am desperate to combat it but now it just makes me feel overall worse. I lost all my creativity. I am too anxious to talk to anyone. I just had an insane freak out outburst of sorts and my dad tried to fight me then all but disowned me. I could not control it and i never can. I feel nothing but guilt, shame, misery, hopelessness and nothingness 24/7. Nothing else. My default is utter despair. I genuinely would be dead if I was not more scared of death than i am a life of torture. Even if it were literal physical torture constantly I would still be too afraid to end it. But I am pretty much already dead. I may as well be. I am a ghost. I cry all the time and when I am not crying its just because I am too empty to. I feel like my brain and my life is ruined. I have sabotaged myself and my relationships and the flicker of a life i almost had because I am weak, pathetic and something in me is fundamentally broken. I just want to die. I cannot focus on anything ever. I get the most rapid mood swings from empty to sad to bored to rage. I get addicted to and abuse any substance I try. I cannot do anything. I shower once every few months. I am posting this so i can focus on something instead of staring at a wall and crying. I do not know why. I know nobody gives a shit. because I sure do not. Fuck it i might as well be dead",0
"I am sobbing while I write this post. I do not think I am in extremely imminent danger so I am probably not a super high priority, but if even one person could help that would mean the world to me. I never thought I would have to post on a subreddit like this. But I have had suicidal thoughts on and off for years, and it keeps threatening to culminate. Tonight has been one of the worst nights. I will try and keep my reasons quick, as I do not know if I even deserve to complain. I was born into a fairly okay situation, middle class, mostly okay family, things like that, so why am I sad? Well, I have lots of mental health issues that at least noticeably impact my ""normal"" human function, and on top of that some of my family often calls me useless because of the way they affect me. I am already in my mid 20s with a niche associate's degree my only accomplishment, I cannot find work to even be like, a cashier or something, I still live at home. No one wants me, not a job, not certain family, including my mom and sister who are the ones to call me useless. To top it all off, my dog is one of the only things that keeps me in it all the time, and now those two are threatening to get rid of her because I am almost out of money, and they think I will not be able to care for her anymore, when I would do anything to care for her, no matter how I have to get money. I need her. I have a very small bit saved up and it is all going to her while I still look for work. So tonight I picked up a knife, thought about how to do it, and... I just cannot seem to follow through. what is wrong with me? I cannot even end it right. So why am I posting at all? Because the thoughts have gotten stronger and stronger over the years, a combo of an anti depressant and therapy is not helping enough, and I feel like something is about to push me over the edge. Losing my dog I am sure would. I need help, please... I just cannot do it...",1
"I am going to be 30 in a few months and I have struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was about 13. No matter what I do whether it be work out, eat healthy, take my meds, do my job, have relationships, etc I always end up back in the same place. My bf and I have been going through a rough patch and I am pretty sure he wants me to leave him alone so he can move on. I told him I am having suicidal thoughts not as a way of manipulating him just trying to communicate what I am going through and he made me feel so terrible. I am already ashamed for feeling this way and he said he does not know what I want him to do with this information. I feel so alone and lost. what is the point in life anymore. I feel so ashamed",1
"I am so sad and feel so bad and insecure and ""wrong"" and not good enough. I feel so alone and at times worthless. I let other people absolutely crush me even though I should not care what they think. I am at my best in a way but also feel terrible. I have a bad self image and feel below other people. I let a fool abuse me and now I feel more ahsamed idk how to get out of this hole",0
"does not matter what I do, what I have, how much money I have hobbies and ""fun"" seem like an escape.I feel ok most of the time, but then realize how I always look towards the future in hopes of living better: I feel like I do not have talents and do not have passions, I feel like a failure and I do not feel confident in myself. I do not feel satisfied",0
"Everything just feels so hopeless. The days are all blending together. Two weeks passes in the blink of an eye and I still have not left my apartment, still working from home,still broke. I spend every day doing the same thing. I hate my at home job so much when I am through with work I either sleep or just stare at the ceiling. I have no joy anymore or any will to engage in my passions/hobbies. My most exciting outing the pst few months was getting a tooth pulled. I do not leave my apartment because I have no friends and anything I need I can get delivered. My job is basically to be a verbal punching bag since I work for a corrupt company. I have spent many nights longing for a friend willing to check in on me or come see me. No new messages, read one week ago. I have just come to accept no matter how hard I try I will never have friends. If it were not for my boyfriend who lives with me I would have ended it a while ago he is the only thing that takes my loneliness away even for a moment. But even he has no clue what goes through me head every day and I am getting worse. Time is standing still",0
"I really do not know where to begin. I am 38 years old and on my second marriage (this will be explained in detail) This marriage also includes a 6 year child (that is not mine by blood but I still claim as my own). I am feeling really down right now and there has not been anything that can lift me up as I keep finding shit that brings me down. I am really trying to find to positive side of things but it just has not been possible. Now, here is a long story of why I just cannot seem to get a break...My first marriage was medicare at first. I honestly did not want to be with her but she won me over and I married her.. We had many years of happiness and life events (buying house, cars, etc). I ended up losing my job and joining the army to make ends meet and try to progress our status in life. I was gone from home for at least a year for training then another 6 months for orders due to premobilization of my unit. Shortly after I was off to iraq for 16 months. Needless to say I was away from my wife and home for quite a long while but I was paying the bills and trying to give her a life she enjoyed.During my mid tour leave I decided to give her a chance to ""come clean"" with any doings that I would have a major problem about (mainly cheating). She said she started smoking weed but that was all... I do not mind weed but I did not want her hobby to interfere with my security clearance so I asked her to stop by the time I got home. Fast forward a while and I found out through her computer that she was sexting another guy, a cop (this will play a part later in the story) and they were sending pictures and videos back and forth along with skyping all dating back to the time I was in Iraq. The first time I found out abou it I told her I wanted a divorce and left our house to live with my friend. She made a Deal with me that she would go through an uncontested divorce if I moved back in and went to marriage counseling. If that did not work out then she would grant me my divorce. Win win for me I thought....One of the conditions of the consousling was I was able to check her phone whenever I wanted to assure myself that no communication was happening with the cop. I did not find any for months. But I decided to put her to a test and see deleted the dude from her Facebook. All while making sure that I could see her text messages even if she deleted them. It was not but hours before I found the first text between them. They were not suppose to be communicating at all and she was trying to hide her tracks by deleting her messages. Then I laid another trap, I left for military stuff for a month or so and decided to ask her for nude pictures. My goal was to see if she sent the pictures to the cop. I got the pictures I asked for, and so did the cop... I immediately started the procedure to divorce this woman... Now on the the part that hurts the most. I found a woman that made me so happy and I found her during the finalization of my divorce. This woman was everything straight from the start. I told her ever single detail of my life and everything between. I even left the military for this woman ( I wanted a family and the military is not conducive to that). She already had a baby but that was fine with me. I fell so in love with this woman I asked her to marry me. We got got married, then tragedy, again.Our young relationship did have quite a strain. We bought new build houses twice within 2 years and then our house was hit with a tornado. We lost a friendship with someone that took us in to live with them, we lived in a hotel for a few months then covid hit and everything locked down. We managed to move into an apartment during this time but it was still difficult. I managed to get t-boned in my truck in which I broke 3 ribs, punctured a lung, and was knocked un conscious. So we had that to deal with. Eventually my new family found its way back into out newest ""tornado"" house. After we worked so hard to get it repaired.Mere months later I found out my wife was sexting with a cop. Keep in mind, this is wife #2 now, doing the same thing as wife #1. We are in marriage counseling now but it does not feel like it is helping. As of late I have been asking her if she is still thinking about this guy and she is flat out lieing about it.Tonight I found it she was upset over the fact that this shitbag found another girlfriend and that she thinks about him everyday and that she 100% knew there was a connection between them.Also, fuck sexlife on Netflix because she feels that while the physical portion of that show did not happen, the mental part did with the cop, I found that out tonight as well so yay me... Life for the last 15 years has been such garbage I wished I died in Iraq. Noone else to talk to...",0
"i posted about this earlier while in a bit of an episode, but id like to return to this with a clearer mind. i have constant suicidal thoughts, they are always there, making fun of me, even as i type this. and yeah, that makes sense to me, I am nearing the end of my journey, and I am killing myself soon enough, but, the strange thing about these suicidal thoughts is they are not in the first person, ie. i need to kill myself, I am an embarrassment, they are in the second person. ie. you need to kill yourself, you are an embarrassment, and they do not feel like me. its just getting really bad. i know i need help, but am i crazy? i know its getting worse, but am i going insane?",1

Its normal for me to not eat or brush my teeth for days or even up to a week at a time when it comes to hygiene lol and either I stay up all night or sleep or sleep for like 30 hours there is no in between. I hate being social. I hate the thought of a job that does not consist of me sitting behind a screen. I have no education, live with mental health issues and I am better off to just relapse on meth or drink daily then actually try to fix myself. I cannot take the pain anymore or thought of having to live like that once again so I just lay here. One day I will get the courage to end it all. Life with no money and no friends",1

"I am a Political Science graduate who had not used my degree to full capacity because, in my country, this is just a pre-law degree with nothing much to offer unless you proceed to law school. I do not want to become a lawyer in the first place, I just took this course since I was pretty much undecided as to what career I really wanted to have in life back then.After graduating at 20 years old, I was pretty much clueless. I am just taking whatever exams available, and although I passed all of the exams that I took, but I never got to use them at all.I enrolled in law school, but quit after 1 month because its not my passion.I passed the exams to be qualified as a policeman, but never entered the police corps because I had myself a tattoo before I even knew that I passed.Now I am 25 years old and spent the last 2 years as assistant in our family business. I thought I had a career going for me as successor to the family business until yesterday, at my parents reunion with their former colleagues and friends.I drove my parents to the venue of their reunion. My parents introduced me to their friends and soon after they talked about career and work. My dads friends kept bragging about their sons and daughters and how their parenting produced IT experts, licensed engineers, nurse, psychologists, doctors, ship captains, etc.I saw how my parents looked worried about not having to brag to their friends that their only son, at 25, still had no work experience outside of family business, and just lived off a small apartment owned by my parents.Conclusion, I really f*%ked up my life. If I could just turn back time and choose a more practical degree, I might have a professional career already, like the sons and daughters of my parents friends. But here I am, trying to learn and manage a family business because what other options do I have? If I refuse to manage our family business and my parents die or something, I am nothing. Knowledge in business is the only advantage I have left in trying to compete with these young professionals. Most of the time my contributions would go unnoticed which have led to my present state of hopelessness. 25, no work experience, felt like its too late to start over again and fix the mess I did back when I was still a bad decision maker.",0

"TW: mention of suicide, self harm, and abuse I wanted to share this story hopefully to give someone out there struggling some hope. When I was around 13 I was struggling with really bad depression. I was constantly in and out of mental hospitals and my biological father would not get me therapy and would not allow me to get medication to help. He and his girlfriend where very controlling of me and I suffered a lot of emotional abuse. It got to the point where I would self harm on the daily and if they seen it they would mock me for it. I was once left on the side of the road with no idea on how to get home and no phone. I was not allowed to eat carbs or anything high in sugar. They convinced me I was severely overweight where I was roughly 180lbs at the time. They gaslighted me and always reminded me of how great of a life I had because I had clothes and a roof over my head. To this day I have a hard time admitting that what I went through was abuse and not just strict parenting. One day I had a really bad breakdown and ended up yelling back at my stepmom. My dad came home said almost nothing to me but to get on the back of his motorcycle. I did and he took me to a little Italian restaurant. We sat in a booth on the corner and had a long talk. A younger couple, maybe in there early 20s, where seated next to us. The woman was blonde and very pretty, and who I assume was her date was a man whose face I did not see. The most rememberable part was when I said, Dad I want to kill myself, does that really mean nothing to you? He was quiet for a second as he thought about it but showed no emotion. Then he looked me in the eyes and said, I believe you think you do but you will not. This triggered something in me. It was at that moment I decided as soon as we got on that freeway on his bike I was going to jump in front of the biggest vehicle I could see. I do not remember saying much after that I just focused on finishing my eggplant parmesan. He got up to pay for the bill and as soon as he was gone the lady sat where he was and asked if she could talk to me. I hesitated then nodded. She told me that I was beautiful and intelligent and a few other things. She reminded me of the future I could have. My tears stopped as I held back a sob. My dad yelled my name and told me to get up. I remember flinching but I do not know what kept me on that seat. I could have been frozen in fear or just latching on to this strangers kind words. She said everything I needed that did not even know I needed to hear. Even if that conversation did not last longer then 2 minutes it changed my life. Now I am in a safe place with a great support system. I plan on studying to become a licensed therapist and helping kids. I wanted to share this story for anyone who is going through a tough time. It sounds cliche but I promise no matter the situation you are in right now, life will get better. A stranger saved my life",0

"I was raised by my grand parents because my parents broke up and left me when i was very little. When i was a child the only people i could talk to was my grand parents because i had no one other than them. I am the only child and i had no family other than my grand parents. I also never had a friend because i rarely see people other than my grand parents. I do not know how to talk to young people like me and make friends, because all my life I have been around really old people. I like my grand parents but I am really tired of being around old people, they suck all my energy and make me feel like I am old too. I do not really have anything to talk with them now so they just watch tv all day and we do not talk much. So the problem is, I am in my room all day, with nothing to do, no one to talk and nowhere to go. When i go outside, i see people around their friends and family and knowing that I am all alone makes me feel worthless. So i feel bad and head home again. But there is nothing to do at home so i start thinking, questioning my life and existence. And that makes me feel worse because i got nothing and no one to live for. I do not know what to do with my life and i do not really enjoy living. Life seems really bleak right now and I am hopeless.This is my second language so I am sorry if i made any mistake while writing this. .",0
Another failed attempt another week or so of suffering . I am so sick of life. God is a selfish bastard who did not make a button in body to just die whenever you want. And hes selfish enough to not kill me even after I pray to die nearly every night before sleep. I want to die. Please. Damnit,1
I do not know where to start. I am stuck at a dead end hospital job. I am in a shitty relationship. I have no emotional support from my family and I have no friends. I feel like a failure. My family thinks I am a failure. I used to be a straight A student in high school and was planning on going to college. But it ended up being extremely overwhelming and I did not even complete the first year. I am also dealing with abuse. I am stuck. I cannot handle it anymore. I have been thinking about suicide for months now. Honestly the only reason why I have not done it yet is because I am a coward. I am scared it will hurt too much and scared that Ill survive it. I am at my jobs parking lot as I type this and researching ways to kill myself Struggling,1
"I had my 4th appointment at my new therapist. So its quite a fresh relationship. Today she told me, we had to define goals for therapy so my insurance covers the costs. She said and I quote: I am not sure what your goals are. I would like to work with you, but I do not feel like we are sitting in the same boat. I cannot paddle around and hold out a rope for you to cling to, when I am not sure, you even want to grab it.I started to dissociate like I always do, when I cannot handle the pressure. She kept looking at me and after some time I started crying and just said: first of all, I do not Even know which lake we are in, second: yes I am so not sure about whether I would like sit in the boat or cling to the rope or if I would just like to drown in the fucking lake and let it be. I am tired of trying to stay afloat. I am tired of trying. I just want to go down, drown and let it the fuck go. I do not know, where these words came from. I heard them, like someone else was talking. But the longer I think about it, the more I think its True. I am totally lost at the moment. Should I keep going there, but than I need goals? The goal not to try to end it all does not seem enough for my therapist. How can I try not to give in on the thoughts of letting it go? New therapist uncovered suicidal thoughts",1
Have to tie up a few things. Final blow came today. I am done. I survived an attempt over a year ago and since then things have got considerably worse. I cannot manage myself in this world.

"My sibling is trans (17, pre-op, ftm, he/them). Our parents are good parents, some bumps here and there. they are opposed to my sibling transition. I support my sibling, but I am not very good with words and kind of a coward. I have a hard time standing up to our dad about it. Our dad is a good man, but he is a butt sometimes. he is so supportive with both of us wanting to pursue artistic careers, teaching us how to be more independent, and will never abandon his us. he is firm about keeping us all together (since he is distanced himself from certain distant family). he is talked us both down from trying to kill ourselves more than once. But he seems so apathetic when it comes to this. I feel guilty for not being able to properly comfort them when they get depressed about it. My sibling and I are both LGBTQ+, are bipolar, have depression, and have anxiety, so I kind of understand how it feels when Dad acts like that. Our Dad has a bisexual sister and loves her (even though she always gets into trouble), so I know he does not hate us for being LGBTQ+. he is not exactly traditional either (he wants his daughters to be independent), so why cannot he be more supportive? I think it is the ""transition"" part he does not like. Maybe he is scared that my sibling will hate that body as well, if not worse. I understand the sentiment, but my sibling is dead set on developing a masculine body. I want to pay for it myself, but cannot. (I am 19, not a guardian, and broke). What can I do to comfort my sibling? Any good advice or thoughts? How do I comfort my trans sibling?",1

"My brother was diagnosed with MDD w/ to psychotic features over a month ago. Despite having anti-psychotic meds and a therapist he only seems to be getting worse. Its only me, my mom, and him. The pressure is literally crushing my mom. He refuses to be open with anyone other than his girlfriend, who has her own shit to deal with. He gets angry when my mom tries to check on him when hes spiraling, almost to the point where I am scared to talk to him. We wake up to him banging on his walls so loud that my room shakes. We ask him what is going on and he either ignores us or says hes fine. His therapists will not talk to us without his permission, which is understandable. We cannot afford for him to see a psychiatrist regularly and not many take his insurance. I feel like all we can do is watch himself worse and idk what to do. How do I help my brother who is struggling with MDD?",0
"Hes the only one I want to talk to. I miss him so much I want to throw up. It is all my fault, I lost everything any chance ever. I am toxic and I hate myself. He loved me different. I broke it all.

I used to be so spiritual but considering I have lived a life of a lies, a facade, pretendnow the only thing I can do is drink enough to sleep I lost everything I have no ambition I have no personality I cannot even wash myself. I hope for me that its just black and I just sleep with no thoughts or conscious. OR I can linger on earth and stay close to some people. OR if I can chose an afterlife it will be where I live in our memories. I told him I love you and Ill see you in another life and he blocked me. This is not his fault, its mine. Time goes by so slow. Its been five months and I wallow in self pity. There is no point. I hope he remembers the good and he will have a happy successful life and be treated like he deserves, I would give anything to go backI cannot and there is no forward I miss him",1
I just got a new job. What I thought was my dream job is now something that I feel I will not be good at. Or that Ill get caught up in the High school shit my coworkers instigate and I cannot help myself but choose to be a part of. Nobody wants to work for the greater good and are in it for themselves. after a week of going back in person I feel like its all bull shit. Read a post that we are still on the path of fucking our planet over. I hate aging. I hate having responsibilities. I hate that I cannot be my full self at work. Always being on edge and just being thrown in to figure shit out feeling like I am being tested. I hate that my parents are getting older. Nothing seems to get better as much as I try to be positive. It just becomes something that is pointless. Like we are going to die because the world is ending. It just seems easier to not be around and just sleep forever. It all feels so pointless,1
"First, I can not believe I am asking this. I have always been the happy, energetic, social, bubbly person in a group with so many plans for the future.After starting therapy my mood has been going down until I was not able to see any point for living. I look at my old photos and wonder how on earth was I this happy and how was I so excited about life (I was still struggling with bad nightmares)?If you ask me to choose between anything I had dreamt of before and death, I would definitely choose death.I do not want to worry about life, work, family, friends, mortgage, weight, health, aging and all that crappy stuff which keeps getting worse with time.I prefer not to exist.

"So I have been a long time reader on here and I figured this would be the best place for help.So about four months ago I started feeling aloof, I guess you would call it, but I have been feeling worse and worse. All the things that used to really make me feel good now just kind of feel like chores. Never really feel like leaving my room. I am 28 this month and I am not sure if I am just feeling down or if depression is what I am experiencing. I have had periods like this in the past but I have been told there is no reason for me to be depressed and usually I take it on the chin and keep walking forward because that is ""what I am supposed to do"". do not really have any real friends so any advice would be much appreciated I could use some perspective",0
"About a month ago, I moved out of my hometown because of someone who i used to be close with. Being near her makes me feel all kinds of negative emotions, mostly because I am torn about what to really feel about our situation. I cannot fully hate her,maybe because I really loved her, in more ways than one. So I moved out, and I had my birthday recently. It was one of the most lonely birthdays I had, but some people still managed to send me birthday greetings, and some even video called me. I was starting to feel better about when I saw a notification informing me that one of my friends commented on her new post. When I checked it, it was a provoking post, subtly informing the world that missing some things in your life that were there for a long time (in this case my presence) can be the best thing that can even happen, with a picture of her smiling. I was so angry and sad and my depression starts kicking in again. After what I did, after giving up my proximity to my family and friends, the comfort I had, just to make things better, she just did that. I did not tell anyone why I left, just did, for her privacy, for no one to bother her, and this is what I get. And it sucks more because I have no one to tell this except strangers online.

"I am 23 and I will be 24 next month and I have not accomplished a lot of stuff that most people my age have. I do not have any work experience, a job, a college degree or my own place. When it comes to jobs I never got one in the past because I never wanted to settle for jobs like Target and Walgreens and the thought of having to do that scared me and it still does. I think I suck at being a cashier and I am afraid that people around my age will walk into the stores and laugh at me for working there and the same goes for places like Mcdonalds. I am also worried about not being paid enough for the time spent working at those places. I still want to go back to college and switch majors but I am not sure what I want to major in and I am constantly being told ""Well you do not have enough time and you have to go ahead and decide before you turn 24."" I do not even have a talent or a passion that I can invest in. I am also constantly being reminded that I am almost a 24 year old with no job and work experience which does not help. Last year I decided that I wanted to move out and get my own place but doing that requires for me to have a job which is something that I do not have. I basically spent most of my life missing out on experiences and oppurtunities and it is still happeing as I get older. Whenever I want to do something on my own that requires money I cannot. For example some people that I know are going to a beach in September and I cannot go to hang out with them for a few days because I do not have any money. it is just going to be another experience that I am going to miss. Sometimes I am jealous of other people and even influencers because of the fact that they are freely able to do whatever they want to do with money and experience their life and enjoy the oppurtunites that they have and I cannot. I never wanted to be jealous of other people to that extent or be in the situations that I am in now but I do not think I did enough to avoid any of that from happening. I am worried that nothing in my life is going to change and that my future is going to be what my life currently is now but worse. Sometimes during the day I am optimistic and sometimes I am stressed out and upset because nothing is working out for me. This causes me to constantly switch between being motivated to being unmotivated and sometimes I do not even want to exist. I am not sure what do about my life or future and I need advice. Time is passing me by and I do not know what to do about my future or life general",0

"Over the past 4 months, I lost all my friends, partner and more. I am 16 and a couple of months ago I was falsely accused of something I did not do, I do not want to disclose what it was at this time, you can draw your own conclusions but of course, there was police involvement because of this. So I got pulled out of school for this and got arrested with my phone taken off me as a part of the undertaking and I could not go to school for a couple of weeks. During this time through the school, rumours were spread of all the things I had allegedly done. Of course, everyone had heard a different story basically making me a terrible person in all their eyes. Because of this, my friend group left me like litter in the street so I have no friends anymore and nobody will talk to me. And since I had my phone taken off me my partner drifted from me and as they put it ""lost feelings"" that they had previously had for me although I held on for them the entire time. We met up like 3 weeks back and I cried the entire time lol. we met by the water and once she left I walked up to my knees in water getting ready to drown myself but only stopping once I saw people approaching, they probs do not know it but I think they saved my life. Before this, I cut both my wrists open in the bath and let the water into my blood. I did not die as you can tell by me writing this but I lost a lot of blood and was bedridden for so long.I have nobody to talk to and nothing to do. I am getting sent to counselling on the 28th and if they will accept me ill have to attend 12 sessions. I do not think i will be able to go through with it this times been so tough i can see that everyone around me like my parents are saddened by my presence and i feel like a burden with them all always worrying about me. Everyone around me has always said they are scared for my wellbeing but now more than ever.i wrote about my life as a coping mechanism if this was not long enough here is my lifes story : [here]( Idk what to do with my life.",1
"did anti-depressants help you guys? i figured that it was not really motivating a change in me, it felt more like a thought. like from some movies I have seen where the doctor prescribes them a medicine for the patients anxiety etc, but its actually made of sugar or glucose tablets, but the mentality of the patient that its going to help them eventually leads them to a better place because of a positive mindset that they are under the right medication. I have tried the therapist too, i had a few sessions but cancelled for two main reasons; it was a bit expensive and my parents were not super keen to pay the expense but still payed, and i felt horrible. and the other reason was the first 2 or 3 sessions helped a lot, no doubt, but the next few sessions were a bit repetitive, and then it was just a blur to me, i was having trouble concentrating at that point. i want to hear if it had a different effect on others. have a good night/day, take care &lt;3 Anti-Depressants",0
"**So this might be a very weird title, and probably an even weirder story but I am going to share it with you anyway:**Since 2018 I have been a big fan of a band, Iron Maiden. You might have heard of them since they are pretty popular. I started listening to this band when I was still in school and decided to go to a concert with my dad which originally would take place in the summer on 2019. Now with the corona and all it got postponed to the summer of 2022 already. As of late I feel like I might be obsessed with Iron Maiden, maybe in a good way but not necessarily. I love their music very much, seen every DVD and love to read interviews and stories about them. Iron Maiden helped me through a tough time last year when someone very close to me got hospitalised with Covid-19 and almost died because of it. Luckily that person survived and is still with us, which I am grateful for every day of my life&amp;#x200B;But now the reason why I wanted to share my story in this subreddit: Iron Maiden are a very old band. they have been going since the 80's already and their oldest member is 69 at the moment. I have only become a fan of them in 2018 meaning I missed out on so much. I could not have been there since the beginning since I was born in 1998. But the things I missed make me feel miserable. The great journeys the band had, the amazing adventures they went on and I missed it all.To add to this, they announced a new album coming in September 2021, the 17th album to be exact. Rejoice you would say right? Well, wrong. I feel very sad and would almost call it depressed. I hardly sleep and I cannot find fun in the little things anymore like playing a game or going on trips with my girlfriend. Every time I read something about Iron Maiden or watch a video/ DVD I get so sad since they are at the end of their career and I have only been there for such a short while. I want to be so excited for the upcoming album and support the band on perhaps their last tour but I just cannot.I know this probably all sounds very stupid and you are probably scratching your heads on why I make such a big deal out of this. And to be perfectly honest, I am wondering the same thing. I feel so stupid that I feel this way but I do not know what I can do to stop it. The realisation that my favourite band might quit in a few years is something I cannot accept.My girlfriend nor my parents do not really seem to get it either. They know I am an avid Iron Maiden fan but they do not get why I am so sad when talking about the end of their career. it is not like they make fun of me for feeling this way, it is just like they think it is weird that it means so much to me. I sometimes think I might be autistic since it bothers me this much.&amp;#x200B;I do not know if there is any advice that would help me, but I wanted to share my feelings right here. Iron Maiden will always stay with me but I am so afraid that I might fall in a very deep depression once they announce the end and that is something I do not want. I have a beautiful girlfriend with whom I plan to have children in the future and grow old together. I cannot let them down because of something like this but I am so scared it is going to happen..... I feel like I am depressed because of my favourite band",0
"I want to die, but have children who depend on me. I daydream about it and the thoughts keep me up at night. I do not want to discover what kind of bad shit life has waiting for me, but I guess I will have to find out. Add it to the running list of crap.However, I keep pushing myself everyday to fight this uphill battle. it is hell. Maybe one day I will get lucky and can finally escape through death. I hate existing in general. If it would not hurt my kids so much, I would commit suicide. I am resentful of how hard I have to work at staying alive, doing right by my kids, and hiding how I really feel. Death would truly be a luxury assuming whatever comes after this life is better. Probably is not. Dying is a luxury",1
"need to have a Near Death Experience to snap me out of this depressive fog I have been in for nearly two years now. My life is without hardship and I have no reason to feel the way that I do, and I believe that waking up in an ambulance/hospital bed will shock me enough to wake me up from this. What is the best way to do this? I do not plan on dying, as it would leave everything so, so much worse for everyone else, worse than anything else I could ever do. I have access to ADHD medication and fluoxetine. I am financially stable enough that a hospital visit will not put my family in financial danger. Should I OD on my medication, write down the time and dose I take, wait 15 or so minutes, then tell my parents to call 911? Is there a better option?I know there are people that care about me.

"I am M[25] and feel I have hit rock bottom. Its been over a month since my date ended seeing me anymore citing 'there is no spark'. I have struggled to get over it and think about her everyday. She was not an insanely hot girl or particularly charismatic, just usual and down to earth which suits me just fine. I felt we had some real connection potential, but clearly not for her. I think had this been the only girl to have ever said this to me I would be fine, but every single girl I have dated from my first in year 8 to now has ended it because they do not feel any chemistry. I have never had a girlfriend and feel like I will never be enough for anybody to want me romantically. I hate the thought of being alone, I want to experience sharing my feelings and going places with a significant other and enjoying life. I accepted a long time ago to be content with myself, but now that is running very dry. I appreciate this may not sound like an important issue to others but for me it opens a whole can of worms regardining my self esteem and feelings of worthlessness. What also hurts is that I struggle to get dates generally and when I do even that feels like a big achievement. I am lucky in some senses I have a career as a teacher, got friends and partly own an apartment of my own, but none of that matters to me at the moment. I think about suicide every day and how I would go about it...i think I need some miracle to keep me going. Feel something missing from my life - giving up hopes of carrying on",1

I went on linked and saw that my old friends are graduating with msc at the age of 24 and i started college jan 2021 but i fucked up my first semester. Ill be graduating at 27/28 with no Work experience. I feel hopeless. What makes it worse is that, is that i have zero self confidence due to my shitty childhood. My mom taught me to be afraid of everything and my dad beat the shitout of me and always told me i was dumb. But at 24 i cannot wait life to get better specially knowing how low my self-esteem. Through out my uneventful life i was always felt like i was going to grow up and have fun and exiting adulthood. But now i see that is not the case. The only thing stopping me from ending my life is, the pain it will bring my family. And also due to my religion. But incase this does not get better, what is the easiest way to commit suicide?do not have a gun. And i do not want to hang myself because, its painful, long and i would not know how to do it.

"Just wondering if anyone has experience with a liquid formulation of Wellbutrin, and where to find it/how to request it.

I know all of the pill swallowing tips and tricks and have tried them all so I am not looking for that.

He told me that being a man is hard and that you cannot stop men from basically undressing women with their eyes in public. He says its not a man fault for staring if the woman is half naked. To me that had the same vibe as saying She was practically asking for it with what she had on in terms of r@p3. I then told him that if he thought men cannot control their actions when it comes to women, then hes an idiot and I did not want to talk to him. In response, he told me that I was sensitive and that is why we cannot have these conversations, and I that I am not a real man anyways. That last part really hurt my feelings because I am a pre-T trans guy and I have a hard time getting people to see me as a male. After that I told him to go fuck himself and I hung up on him.

"Hello, my best friend is a 28 (F). she is been struggling with depression for some years now, she is medicated and such. She had a suicide attempt around 2017 after a very bad burnout episode (her career is highly demanding). she is been with this boyfriend for 10 years. They broke up for 2 months around 2017, a little before her suicide attempt, then they resumed their relationship. He broke up with her yesterday and she tried to take her life. She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably. Her psychiatrist is traveling to where she is (she is out of town, about 18 hours driving away). I feel really sad that i cannot be there for her and her mom. I do not know how to continue to support her. I want to be there 100%. I have never been depressed so I do not know how to approach it. I have been crying because I am really scared that we will lose her. Can someone please tell me what can i do or say to help? Any tips are appreciated.

I always stop myself but I have been reading a lot and preparing for death and I feel like I finally found the mindset I need to kill myself. I do not feel nearly as scared of death anymore. I feel so good like I can finally end all of this and stop feeling this way. The power is in my hands to stop it all and I only have to die. I feel liberated in a way. I do not have to take this anymore. I can say fuck this and go away. it is my choice. I know people will do what people do and try to stop me but it is an anon account for a reason. I feel ready. I am ready. I can make the world a better place by leaving it and that is the contribution I am going to make tonight. I cannot stop drinking and I finally embarrassed someone I care about for the last time. I do not want to feel this depression ever again. I finally feel like I can do it.,1
"I am 41. Not sure exactly how I got here but I honestly feel cursed by god or the universe or whatever forces are at work. I have felt depressed for about 25 years now. And before that, as a child I felt different, weird, isolated, and alienated. I was 18 before seeking real help, when someone at my university asked me ""Have you ever considered killing yourself?"" and it occurred to me that that was not normal. I have been on most of the major antidepressants. I have been hospitalized twice. I have seen countless doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists and still I am in the same place. I have reached out to TMS and Ketamine places but have not gotten anywhere. I have tinnitus and have taken a number of blows to the head throughout my life but never been sure if its related to the depression. I have a supportive family and even a great wife and I feel terrible for relying on them so much financially and emotionally while not being able to make progress. My main problem seems to be that I do not feel like I am a part of anything that is going on. I do not understand what is going on. I do not know what I am supposed to be doing. Everything seems wrong and all I see is chaos and confusion. I am honestly trying my best to survive and thrive but it just keeps getting worse. I went to college because I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. Now I barely even enjoy films or it feels like every idea has been done. I knew I could not network or assemble a crew or any of the necessary things I would have to do. The most I was ever able to do was to make wedding videos.and hire maybe 1 other person. I decided to stop doing that, got a job editing short promos for TV shows which gave me a portfolio no one seems to care about. Worked for local government creating media before getting fired for voicing concerns about noise in the office because I am so sensitive. Then with no one hiring me, I had to go back to driving which I have done ever since I was able to work. I used to think driving made me feel free and I could be alone with music, podcasts, and my thoughts, but now I do not want to be alone with my thoughts because all I think about is killing myself all day. For two years, I transported dead bodies which was super depressing. Now I work for FedEx and its hot, noisy, and extremely strenuous. Every time someone tries to help me with a job prospect it leads nowhere, to the point where I do not even want to accept the help. I have been rejected from so many places that it seems I would be qualified for. I look for jobs all the time and they all look really bad or do not pay much. And the process takes so much time only to be rejected at the end. I want to quit my job but only have spotty gig work to fall back on. I feel like a failure and that I cannot contribute financially.I do feel gratitude for the things I have. I have tried journaling, meditation, yoga, exercise, and plenty of the other things people suggest you do. But my mind stays locked on past mistakes and cringey moments. I beat the shit out of myself all day everyday and cannot stop. I compare myself to others, get jealous, and get angry that I cannot be normal or successful. And it feels like I am getting dumber, more forgetful, and harder of hearing when I need to have all my faculties working as well as possible. It just seems I am getting older and my life gets more sad and embarrassing. I barely want to leave the house because I am sensitive to the horrible things I see or situations I might end up in.I do not know what to do anymore. I am scared of getting older and how it could possibly get even worse. I need help but I cannot seem to get it. Everything is out of reach. Everything seems impossible. I have tumbled down for a long time and see no way back up",0
"I am 20, and sincerely I do not see myself living more than 25. I am a disaster and I do not have any salvation. Wait for the best to happen is not an option anymore.

"I have never ran away and I really want to, I want to get away from my family and have the thrill of playing an extreme game of hide and seek. It may sound psychopathic, but I want everyone looking for me until weeks later the cops find my hanging corpse. I want to go to the gas station and load up on all the snacks I can think of before getting the courage to end it all. I am not sure why I am posting this, but I really want to get it out and this is the only place I can think of. I want to run away and hang myself",1
I have been beaten down by the world. I never get the help I need when I try. I have been a piece of shit to the people in my life when I know I want to change that. I have no motivation to try anymore because it all leads back to where I am now. All I can do is hope that I do not wake up in the morning. cannot take it anymore,1
"As an 19 Y/O with high functioning autism, life has always been tricky for me, but it was always alright I guess, had some friends, some relationships etc. But 3 years ago something weird happend, after a bad breakup and some shitty life events I have not been myself. All my emotions are numbed out, my mind is blank 24/7 and I cannot communicate normally anymore. I cannot handle life anymore like this.Next week I am starting treatment with antidepressants for the first time and if that is not going to make me feel better all my hope is lost. I do not enjoy life anymore like it is now. Letter to myself",0
"Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am 19M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide",1
"I often get confused by my own depression. I think to myself, how can I be depressed? I have many friends, a successful job that I have earned being employed at the same company for 9 years, I am in college working on my 3rd degree, I am proud of myself and generally have a pretty good relationship with myself. I have been in therapy for over 10 years. I am from a family of addicts, I have been sober for 10 years with no desire to relapse. All in life is fairly good, I really have no complaints other than the normal stresses of life. Yet, I have these episodes where I completely shut down. I will be high functioning for good periods of time than BOOM! I am out of commission for a few days where I put myself back together. Does anyone else suffer like this? Any recommendations for self help books? I recently read many books about the power of no to avoid burn out but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! High functioning depression",0
"it is a terrible idea for one diagnose oneself, or anyone else, with any kind of mental illness.But what do you do when you see someone exhibiting patterns that share many similiarities of a particular condition?In my opinion,My dad is an extremely high-functioning autist.My mother has abandonment issues manifested through codependency and overprotectiveness.My older brother developed a plethora of rituals, that haunt him day by day. Cleanliness addiction to the point of circumcising late, and then developing a trauma from it.My sister has an oppositional defiant disorder, but last night, her entire defense mechanisms broke down from alcohol poisoning, to a point where she was attempting to drown herself.I have had two full-blown manic attacks, both of which ended with a baker act (law enforcement committed me to mental health institutions), and one of them ended in a suicide attempt, to which I simply cannot rationalize how the loaded, cocked, and safety-off gun did not fire. I do not want to rationalize it either.we are a family of Puertoricans.If anyone here knows how latino families work, parents disable their children, by doing everything *for* them, with the genuine intention of protection.I am 24 now, I am still watching my high highs, and my low lows, but as life kept rapid-firing responsabilities, and difficult obstacles to develop my craft/career, it is been a little hard to reflect upon everything.Ever since Covid started/2nd manic attack, I have been forcing myself out of my antisocial tendencies, and at the very least, have conversed extensively with my mother.My mother, coming from a small, family infested town of San Lorenzo, was always very knowledgeable of our genealogy. From her side, and from my dad's side, who also grew up in the same town.Her memory, understanding, and reasoning of our family, and quite distant ancestry, has been key to our slow, but gradual recovery.We have genes from generations of undiagnosed conditions.I want to emphasize just how important my family's hometown is to the story.Everybody knew what everybody was doing in Puerto Rico, more so in the small, rural town of San Lorenzo.it is a humid, hot tropical island with the consistent blessing of constant breeze, thanks to all the mountains.This meant that *everybody*was outside at all times.Specifically in my hometown, everyone knew each other's first and last names, their families, profession, interests... But what everyone was always in a high-alert lookout for was... what people were fucked in the head.Social class was absolutely paramount, and equivalent to success in the 20th century. But in San Lorenzo... your entire life was determined by your the image of your status. Even more so than the status itself.Who your friends could be, what jobs would become accessible, the way people would look at you, and even how your family spoke to you.Gossip spread faster than wildfire.My ancestors suffered traumas from the military. And whether or not they were willing, or even begging, to seek professional help, such weakness would tarnish the image of our name.After I loaded, cocked, and pulled the trigger on my head...That was rock-bottom.Nothing is worse than nothing.I have set myself to make ammends, and rebuild my broken family.It is tough. I am 24. I have dreams and aspirations to use my animations and break into the gaming industry.One way or another.However, the story I want to tell through my games can only written once I understand my own.I love my family.More than anything. They are the reason I am here. They are the drive behind my actions. But they are just as busy trying to find purpose in their own lives, as they are trying to rationalize their difficulties.I am content with this fate. I am happy to be here, to be alive, to know everything I know, and attempt to leave footprint of unconditional love wherever I go.But I do not have anyone to talk to.I do not want to talk about my family issues, or my mental state...But about the games they play. About books they have read.About shows they love.About their top 100 artists.About that bitch customer who just refused to leave without their change.About strategies to overcome my fear of lizards.About day-dreaming of pulling a popshuvit, even though I am terrified of falling from just walking.About how the fuck do analog clocks even work?it is all I really need, man. Nothing else. Curing a broken family. The need for a friend.",0
"I cannot talk to anyone about my problems, I see a therapist every Friday but it always feels like the world is closing down on me. I have been dealing with a specific OCD theme for the last 8 months and it sucks. I feel like I will never get over it. On top of that, I am lonely asf.

"I do not know if I have depression or not. What I do know is that feeling the absolute fucking worst about everything and everyone around me happens quite often and never truly goes away. This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent, although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time, which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go. It almost feels like all those things are happening and that I am being left behind to build my own new path brick by brick, and I am all out if bricks. My head feels like a dull, dense boring grey rock with nothing going in or out and nothing ever changing. I do not have access to weapons in my country but if I had a gun in my home, I would point it under my chin without hesitation, and seriously consider stopping this mess right there and then. I just feel like my head is a big grey rock with no individuality or sensitivity",0

"People often say that depression is like a mask or cloak that utterly smothers the real person underneath, and I see that now. I went from a happy, driven and interested person to someone who cannot even keep their room clean and it is destroyed perhaps the best relationship I ever had. I feel like my personality and presence has just done a complete 180 and I am not fun to be around. She had so much patience and so much effort, but she just got a me-shaped disappointment in return. Nothing but anxieties, messy rooms and bare fridges. No joy and interest in the world around me. We could not talk or communicate about anything anymore. I feel like I am just listing through life. I honestly realise that it is better for her that she does not have to burden herself with someone like my current state (I know fully that it is a burden). I just hope that, maybe someday, she can see the ""real"" me again and we can go back to how things were at the beginning. How things were for me in the months before. I guess I am still upset that things had to end this way. it is my fault and I have to live with that. I know I have to improve and I am filled with hope that I can get myself out of this deep pit I find myself in, but part of me is afraid that I will not ever be able to.

"Asterisk because I have never been diagnosed, and I do not actually know what is it that I am struggling with. Anyway. I see now that it will never go away. This sadness will simply always be here. And it will continue pushing people away from me, because I know that being close to someone depressed is painful and frustrating. I will not be able to short-leash it anyway, so why even try. I will never find a bf(or a gf, sigh) because no one will stick around with me, because I am tiring and no fun. Idk if my friends will stay, I will not judge them if they choose to leave because of the whole ""stop talking to toxic people"" thing. And I am that, I am upsetting and boring, I am angry, frustrated, anxious - hardly a positive experience. My sister tolerates me, and I feel bad because yknow you cannot really leave your sibling unless they are a serial murderer or something, so she will have to endure me depression* will always stand between me and people",0

"Did any of you used to be really into things like hobbies but just stopped because you knew you would be dead in the somewhat near future and putting effort into learning things and growing as an individual would just be pointless? Like you are putting all of this effort in and will never see the end result of a polished skill that takes years to produce?For me it started around 17 (I am 25 now). I used to be really into learning the piano, reading books on history, psychology, investing, nonfic and so on, working towards being a physically healthy person, and overall just trying to develop/fix myself. I think this was when I got into self-help stuff and gained a lot of hope for the future at that time.Since about 23 I have just started to stagnate heavily. I stopped doing the things that were making me a better person. My mind just tells me I am wasting my time and that what I am doing is pointless. I will never be a whole human being and I will never live a good life. Why even try to grow? I am just going to fall all the way back down to rock bottom like I have time and time again.

"I am at a point in my life where I have sort've just had enough. I do not have many friends and not so long ago, someone closest to me ended his own life. He already had his issues, worse ones than me and he is tried to do it before.. I do not know why it is surprised me so much but now I feel alone. While I was sitting at home playing games and relaxing my best friend was killing himself and that fact kills me. My girlfriend is not around anymore, she was about the only person who truly made me feel happy. Having her around made everything feel better. The entire relationship gave me something I desperately needed, hope that I could be better and confidence, something I always had very little of. Now that is gone too and I blame myself and my issues for it. I have my own issues as well. I have anxiety which has gotten so bad to the point where I cannot go to uni simply because I am scared. Not to mention depression which just feels like it is getting worse and worse by the week. Suicidal thoughts are constant, nowadays. They do not stop. I think about it a lot when I try to sleep and as messed up as it sounds, it is the only thought that comforts me and helps me sleep. I just hate myself nowadays and I genuinely cannot imagine myself ever liking myself.Not so long ago I did some research online on what drugs could because an overdose and decided that was the easiest way to go about it, along with a decent amount of prescription drugs that I have at home. I am truly at the end of my rope. I dislike living and what scares me is the fact that I truly want to die. I feel I have no future. Not so long ago I decided I would wait till after my birthday to do it. Not because I want to be around for my last birthday, but because my grandmother was born on the same day as me and my older brother was born the day prior so I did not want to screw it up for them, but that thoughtfulness is gone and I am about ready to throw my trainwreck of a life away tonight. I do not really have anyone to tell these things to so I figured a bunch of online strangers would not be the worst thing in the world. I am sorry for making this thing longer than it should have. I am no longer interested in living.",1
"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression + Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student",0
"I feel so safe in this subreddit. I do not even feel that I truly fit in here since I am too scared to end my life and I have never had an attempt. But I feel safest sharing my thoughts here so maybe that counts for something. People on other subreddits just say to seek therapy. I am just really tired. I am really, so tired. there is too much for me to handle now. And I am afraid that I am not strong enough. I am actually much weaker than I thought a person could ever be. The fact that I am way too scared to ever end it, to just get it over with and stop hurting makes me feel even weaker. I cannot believe this is real life. It does not even feel real, it is that bad. My mind cannot handle how bad it is anymore, that it just feels like a dream or a video game constantly.Too weak to have healthy relationships, too weak to find a job (let alone get a job), too weak to have confidence, too weak to not care what others think, too weak to stand up for myself, too weak to confront my parents, too weak to get past anxiety, too weak to be in my own head, like fuck... even my own head is not safe?And to top it off, too weak to even trust myself that what I am feeling is real. I know I cannot fake feeling this low but I do not trust myself to say that I am not faking it. Or that I am just looking for attention or being dramatic. I know my dad would say that but I am too weak to blame him for it. it is just easier to blame myself. Just say that I am being dramatic.My last resort is antidepressants. I cried when talking to my counselor about it. I told her I never thought I would ever have to ask for this, ask to be prescribed happiness.

"VENT TW: suicidal thoughts, wanting to die, abuse(?) mentionHi readers.... this is one of the only safe places I have to express myself. And its my last resort. I am on the verge of doing something stupid and my thoughts are scattered, so please bear with me.I hate myself, really, really hate myself. I was born into a family of narcs, two bio parents that never actually wanted to raise their kids. Dad was not as bad, i guess. He mostly never called or texted while we were growing up. He stopped, anyway. And T (that is my egg donor who does not deserve to be called a mom) was an incredibly abusive bitch. I can tell she has never actually loved her kids, me especially. So I got a lot more of the abuse when I was a child, and as an adult, I sometimes fall into the same type of relationships I used to have. I try so so hard not to, but its like these people find me and I cannot get away.So that brings me to my current bf. I thought he was the most beautiful person when we met. He knew about my issues, I was upfront. But I did tell him I do my best to keep my emotions from becoming too much. And I have worked in therapy for 3+ years to be better, and I felt like I was making progress. But now I am wondering if maybe I am just a narc and I give myself too much credit for my progress. He literally told me after we met that he was a bad person and a monster. (When people tell you who they are, listen, right?) And I honestly was wary but just figured he had issues like anyone else. Except the more time we have spent together (been together for two years in Dec) he really just seems to hate me.We do not usually argue, but when we do he basically threatens to leave me all the time. And I literally have to basically get on my hands and knees shaking from the panic attacks like a dog, unable to talk from crying so much or else he does not believe that I love him and want him to stay. His favorite thing to tell people about me is that I am obedient and that I do what he says. Obedient! Like i *am* a dog. Like its my only good quality, and for the record, I have a mind of my own. I do not always do things he says, but if he asks me to hand him something, I do it and its not a problem. But if I do not, then he tells me stuff like I do not love him and he is second guessing our relationship because I will not do what he asks. And if he walks put the door to leave, if I do not chase after him, I do not love him enough or at all.he will get hurt by any little thing I say or make assumptions about things I say or do, but then he will turn around and project it back on me and say that I do not listen to him, I over react, etc. He never takes responsibility for any of the mean and hurtful shit he says. Its always my fault for not understanding or ""attacking"" him. (I could literally just ask him to pick up after himself and he will literally flip his shit).I am not going to say I am perfect, or that I never have said anything mean to him. However, I always apologize and work on whatever he claims has hurt him so that I do not do it again. He refuses to do the same, claiming that he will never change because that is how he is. he is even basically said suicidal people deserve to die (knowing that I have issues with this). This is already so long, so I am going to stop, but my heart is broken and I cannot stop crying. I wish I was dead and if I ever mustered up the strength to do it, he would be the reason why. I love him, and I do not understand why he is so fucking mean.If you read all this, thanks. And I am sorry. My bf has made me hate myself after years of therapy, and I wish I was dead. Why cannot I find someone who genuinely loves me like I love them?",0
"So my partner, child, and I were having family time. We started a new world on my realm. My child likes role-playing a mischievous mole. I just want to progress through the game. Same with my partner. My child does this thing where they are hanging around our bases, living under the dirt and tunneling about. Mole skin and all. I can hear my chests opening through their tv, so I know they are close the entire time. Were at a point where I have exceeded more random items than can be stored in a single double chest, and they have at least taken four wheat, but who knows what else? I cannot keep mental inventory of every little thing. Finally, after acquiring diamonds and preparing to make an enchantment table, I notice a stack and a half of birch logs missing. I say can I have my birch wood back? My child says I have not even had any birch wood. I say Okay. I was not going to argue. what is the point? This is what they want. They want the drama. This is how this human is. They want to actualize their identity as the mischievous mole living at the expense of the hapless surface dwellers, triumphing against all their efforts to stop them. Why would I do myself the disservice of playing into that?So instead, I just fill up my mine with cobble, I revert my farm to grassland, I store all of my stuff in chests, break the chests, and light it all on fire, throwing the flint and steel in the fire as well. I was clean. I was renewed. I was untethered from this world and had nothing anybody could ever take from me again. Then I start letting the world do with me as it does the unprotected: I let it kill me over and over again.Naturally, my partner and child start to lose their taste for this, not being able to get a meaningful response to their queries as to why I turned a 180. Why would I tell them? there is no possible positive outcome. Only undesirable outcomes. In fact, ALL outcomes would be undesirable REGARDLESS of my course of action. And with the age of my child, with their personality firmly established, there is no hope of influencing a positive change. So I merely respond nonsensically. No anger. No mirth. No silent treatment. Just matter of fact nonsense and non sequiturs. I am not interested in manipulation. I am just interested in not even being worth talking to. And giving them a single in to begin to pull information out of me is just an opportunity for them to manipulate the situation into whatever meets their needs. I am not interested in that. I just want a clean getaway.So now, I am away (physically anyway). And I am starting to think about a plan. I want to cancel all of my subscriptions. Pay off all of my debts. Sell all of my stuff and use the money for funeral arrangements, the completion of which will be ensured by a 3rd party (not sure how it would work, but I am sure it could be figured out). Put together a complete breakdown of all of my accounts (financial and others) details and logins. Leave them for my partner. Get rid of every single one of my earthly belongings, finally getting rid of even all of my clothes and phone at the very end (Ill need them to reach that point). Clean up every loose end. Erase every possible trace of my existence from this world. Then end my life, finally. And be free of all of this. My partner will have to deal with my car on their own, but you cannot have everything. Perfection is an absurd concept, so slight hitches are acceptable.So, yeah. I am really thinking about this. It will permanently damage my partner and child. It will hurt them in ways which will heal over time, and some ways that will hurt forever, which is a tragedy. But I feel like I am finally going to be okay trading my pain for theirs: something I never believed I could feel okay about until now for some reason. More and more I have wanted out for 27 years. Maybe now is finally my time. I am thinking about killing myself because my child stole my birch logs in Minecraft.",1
My fiancee and I got into another argument least night. A lot of shit got said and I ran once with the intention of just throwing myself of the bridge over the highway. He wrangled me back in and shit kept going. We called down and our room mate asked me to river her somewhere so I did and went to bed. Now I am getting yelled at for leaving him alone with his thoughts. For not being there for him immediately. For everything. it is my fault he is like this. I am hurting him. I am making things worse. And thus is not the first time I have contemplated just doing it. he is texting me in a rage rn. I have stayed up so many night contemplating just getting up and dying. I have googled so many methods. I got in line 3x for the suicide line and never made it to an agent each time after waiting hours. I am just so tired. Everything makes me feel guilty. I cannot say no. I am a spineless bitch. I am just.... tired. I feel cold. I want to cry but I cannot. My eyes will not let me. I feel like the little bit of juice left when you change batteries and throw them in the junk drawer. not a damn thing i do will ever be enough,1
"My whole life I feel like I have been going through the struggle. My dad is an abusive and toxic parent that put me through so much as a kid into early adulthood. I worshipped him until I was 20 and a light bulb went off in my head and I realized all the bullshit he put me through. I have separated from that relationship but still feel the effects of it. I have been heavily depressed the last few years. My mom died 2 years ago and I worked a low paying depressing job for a long time. This year I really wanted to get out of the rut I was in, and I got a new better paying job, and am starting to make friends for the first time since freshman year of high school. For a moment there it seemed like things were finally starting to look up, but in a very short period of time work became a lot more tense, some drama has members of my family hating me (thankfully only the toxic members as the cool ones know what is up) but it is still really getting to me. I got a kitten to help with my mental health but it died after a few weeks. My roommate is moving out at the end of our lease despite originally agreeing to stay another year, and I am worried I cannot afford to live on my own yet. there is a girl I like but she does not like me. I am getting hit with insane medical bills. I know this sounds like typical stuff people have to deal with, but it is happening all at once and I cannot remember the last time I was happy for any significant amount of time. I feel so alone and lost, and I feel like I have just kept going through hell over and over again my entire life. Will it ever get better? Will I ever not be alone? Is happiness even possible? I do not know what to do",0
there is a lot Id love to write out and share but I have stopped seeing the point. It will not change my circumstances sadly. The end is near for me. I can feel it. I am very sad that its come to this. Wasted potential. Good luck everyone. Try whatever you need to. Do whatever it takes to feel better. Exhaust all options until there is nothing left. Not even myself anymore. Not someone I recognise. Goodbye So much I want to say but too tired to write,1

Days where I can write on my white board, where I can get my shit done. Where every task is completed and I feel proud. Then, there comes the next day. And the emptiness hits. The cloud of sadness.

"My father is a real macho guy, and he thinks mentally ill people are just lazy and giving poor excuses. So he definitely cannot understand what I am going through. But today, he went away to meet his mother(my grandmother) and I can talk alone with my mother. But the problem is, I have told her about my mental health before. It was probably a year ago, and she&amp;father said ""it is because you stay indoors all day"", ""go out and exercise"" and all the usual shit. So since than, I just stayed silent at home. I know today is the best day to talk about it, but I just cannot do it. it is at least 5 years since I was depressed and I could not gather up my courage when I was younger. So how am I supposed to do that? I know what I have to do, but I do not know if I have the strength to do it.",0
"I take AP classes and am, on paper, a great student; but I absolutely hate school. The second semester of last year I was self-harming and leading a very inconsistent life. I would stay up days at a time just doing work just waiting for it to all be over. I do not have any aspirations for my career and I do not even want to continue school. I do not want to be dependent on my parents forever either, but clearly, I am too worthless and lazy to actually do anything about it. Is this normal to feel at a very low point during Summer break? I just absolutely loathe school but it seems like I have to go in order to just lead only a possibly more comfortable life. Most people, and probably I, will end up in the cycle of working-and-waiting for the next break or end up dependent on others; both of which I am doing now. The future looks dim and adulthood seems like a hopeless, incessant version of what I am dealing with now. I am not sure I can even become a capable adult at this point. I have thought about just ending it all, but I am ready to say goodbye to my family, even if I know I am disappointing them and everyone else by being this way. Does anything get better? Advice for how to deal with the impending doom (of age).",0

"Story of my life, right? My life is on such a downward spiral and it is all my fault. I cannot handle real life responsibilities and so I just gave up on life. I have no motivation or willpower. All I do is go to work, go home, procrastinate and play games until I am tired, cry and then do it all over again the next day. I wake up everyday and I go to the same old shitty part time minimum wage job. Everytime I try to crawl out of this pit of depression, I just fall right back down. I tried improving myself with school to try and get out of my shit job, but I cannot even study without being distracted and so now I am 3 weeks overdue on my homework with no desire to do homework anytime soon. I feel so guilty about it, but I cannot bring myself to sit down and learn. I am severely in debt because I am an impulse shopper, and I have never been in a relationship in the 24 years I have been alive on this shit hole, so I have no one to even share how I feel (not even family cares or understands what I am feeling either). I feel so trapped in my eternal depression cycle. There are so many things in my life that make me want to end my life, but the only thing that is keeping me here is my survival instinct. I hate it here.How come everyone else seems to have their shit together, but me? Why cannot I just be a normal functioning human with a normal brain?

"I know its not super helpful to self diagnose, but it seems like I have a lot of extreme highs and lows. That I cannot quite control sometimes. it would be fair to say its just mood swings because of all the hormones and puberty stuff but idk. Sometimes I say things to people, make false promises during my high, or present this part of myself that they cannot quite recognize when I am at my extreme low making me seem like a completely different person. I do not even remember half of the stuff I have said or done while I was in this high/manic phase. And people take that to offense but it really is fuzzy. I guess it just makes me sad because people think that is me, but its not really. And, my lows are extremely dark and I do not have the energy to talk to anyone. I barely had any energy to type all of this. I am glad to say though that today I did not allow myself to sink further. This morning was definitely awful, but I gave myself a chance to at least rationalize. Took some deep breaths. And carried on with my day as best as I could. I think I am bipolar",0
"I am just a kid in high school but lately over summer break I have not really done anything besides play video games at home and I have not really spoken to friends in like 2 months even when I went to school. Or anyone, besides my parents. I have become a total shut in which feels horrible and every day I just want to throw myself out of my window. what is the point? it is not like I do anything at all, I have crazy social anxiety so going out and speaking to the people i have not spoken to in so long feels daunting, and it seems like they all did not even notice, they continue to have fun with other people while I sit in my room wondering what reason I should not just kill myself if I feel miserable all day anyways. I guess the because of my misery is feeling like I am missing out or being a bad friend by not speaking to anyone but it just feels horrifying to do that, when there is a very easy way out my window where I will not have to even think about anything that stresses me out. Plus my future is terrifying, I have no idea what I am supposed to do with my life once I finish high school, and it makes me super anxious. I have never felt this way before so it is just terrifying. do not know why I am feeling like this",1

"Hello again. I... I feel like I am dead inside. I have no idea what I am doing with my life. I am an absolute failure. 22 years. Recently lost my job, every member of my family hate each other, I have no life partner, nobody to hang out and do silly stuff. I am just laying in my bed rn, trying not to get suicidal again...I am afraid of getting out of my house due to PTSD. I have nothing to watch on TV, I do not want to eat anything.

I like being called, it feels like someone cares about me, but the only one calling me is the bank ""Fuck off, I do not want a credit card"" I think, but deep inside I do not want to hang up because it is the only human interaction I get.

"I have thought about ending it all so many times but now the time has come. I really start consider it as an option. Before this very day I always could convince myself that there is at least something to go for, one goal to achieve and work for but not anymore.After more than 10 years I finaly met the love of my life and I really could not be happier that day, it was even more than I hoped for.That did not last until the end of the day though when she confessed to me the following things:- It was purely exhausting for her and not a single minute of relaxation.- Nothing ever had a meaning for her.- She also said she had to meet someone in real life to have a connection to them, she did not build up one to me though.- The chances of her falling in love with me ever so slightly are even worse than before.- She only desired me because her boyfriend neglected her.- Cuddling with me never felt good for her in any way, she wanted to make me happy for at least one moment, which she achieved mind you.She also told me she does not know yet if she even wants to see me again which hit the hardest of all. I did not just lose all hope in ever being in a relationship with the woman I love but I also know now how much of a burden I am to even have around.You might find my problems laughable but there really was nothing else in my life I ever had to go for but her and now I have ruined it by being myself. I do not know how I will do it yet but I am pretty sure now I have completed the last chapter in my life and it was such a bittersweet ending. I have lost the last meaning in my life",1
"I finally figured it out. *Any* expression of existential crisis, nihilism, neurosis, or depress is what bothers people. They do not care that you feel that way, they just care that you *express it.* it is as if any sort of negative emotion you are feeling causes them personal distress. They do not care if YOU are feeling it, only that you do not share it. it is not the depression that bothers people. it is when you talk about it.",0

"I do not expect anybody to help or read. I feel like asking for help is weak, being ""depressed"" is weak (Towards myself only. I do not look at other people as being weak), I feel like if I seem vulnerable then people will not like me. I would rather be the one to help you with your problems than tell mine. I try to stay positive and 'cool' all the time, but behind the scenes I am actually slowly breaking.Since lockdown, I have basically isolated from my friends, spent most my days alone in my room gaming/wfh, doing nothing productive. I do not talk to anybody anymore. My heart actually kind of hurts writing this, I do not know how I fucked up so bad. I used to be social, go to festivals with friends etc, but now I am struggling to find the enjoyment in anything.I am usually a strong person, but I think I am coming to the realization that my life is actually shit and I have been masking it for so long.I have not had a girlfriend in 5 years, I have had interests but I always played it distant and eventually it all phased into nothing. I am almost 24 and I have no relationship, no friends, just a job I cba for, meanwhile Facebook/Insta full of everybody having kids, achieving things, I know we should not compare social media to rl but it just shows how much of a fucking waster I have became.No idea what writing this is going to achieve, but I feel like I just cannot keep going on like its OK.

"I have dealt with suicidal thoughts since i was a child thanks to abuse I received. When I was 16 i tried to overdose but got scared and begged my parents to take me to the hospital to get help. But all they did was make me throw up and take me to a Christian counseler a week later. Started cutting to deal with the emotional pain, only thing that helped. I had a feeling when I grew up I would turn to drugs and alcohol to deal with these thoughts. And that is exactly what I did. I thought I would become a heroin abuser but mostly it is alcohol. When I was 18 I went manic and ran away because I was sick of being controlled by my parents. When I was found a week later my parents were more pissed than anything. After getting commited against my will I had to do outpatient therapy. My parents were awful to me, calling me a narcissist for daring to smoke a little weed to take the edge of the stress. My dad at one point physically dragged me out of bed one time to go to therapy. I had to move away, but as usual I always spiral and had to come back. Lately I see them for what they are. Sad sacks of shit. If i dare open up to them they tell my siblings-they told my brother about my child abuse and drinking without my consent. They need therapy but refuse to go because they think they are in the right. I just want to run away again just take a bus somewhere and just go home with someone from the bar every night. I do not even care if it is with a dangerous man he would be doing be a favor. Or sleep in the streets idc anymore.But that is not possible. They took all my money as well. I am being held captive emotionally and financially. So I am cutting again and I am going to take all my meds, even if it does not kill me right away I will probably still have organ failure (* have physical issues I almost died a few months back from septic shock). This seems the best way, I am so sick of this so fucking much. I wish they would die so I would not have to. My parents are going to put me in my grave.",1

"So at the beginning of 2020 I stupidly got married to a woman I was dating for only a month, but that is not what I am here to talk about. A couple of weeks after she moved in she made me get rid of my cats that I loved very much because one of them scratched her daughter. With tears running down my face I crated them and left them with a coworker of mine and have missed them ever since. After getting divorced I reached out to the co worker to ask for the cats back but was told that he lost both of them. I now live with this constant guilt and regret of abandoning them for a woman I should have left when she gave me the ultimatum. Odds are that they are probably dead. They were inside cats all they are lives and probably spent their last days scared, alone, and wondering where me and their sister were. I cannot get over this guilt and honestly I do not think I deserve to get over it. Ill probably live with this for the rest of my life My biggest regret",0

"This shit always be coming in waves. One day I feel happy and I think, there was absolutely nothing wrong with me lol I was so dramatic, and boom comes the weeks of depression and being angry with everything and everyone. Being out of control with my emotions but feeling empty and numb at the same time. I cannot sleep, and then I cannot wake up. When I finally fall asleep I can stay there forever. When I am down, I do not WANT to get better. I roll my eyes at all that you need to be POSITIVE, its a mindset crap. I do not care. But when I am okay, I am advocating for that and motivated to improve my life. I think I am constantly in the middle of self improvement and self destruction. I do not want to go out anymore or see other people, and sometimes I feel all the relationships I have around me are all fake. My friends probably secretly hate me and look down on me. My boyfriend probably thinks those girls in porn are much prettier and better than me. I am the failure of the family with no good career, money, or knowledge of the world. I cannot talk stocks and policies like my brother. And I have nothing I am really good at either. I can learn but I have no motivation either. My family will think I am an idiot anyways that is how its always been. I often find myself wanting to restart. Have a clean slate, everything is brand new and I feel normal. But I do not have the resources or willpower for that. And sometimes I just wish I never existed, I wish I can disappearessentially die without the pain and consequences on others around me. After a decade now being depressed on and off, I realize that I should probably try some medication. I have been weary of trying it but probably its worth a shot? Sometimes I convince myself to forgive the people that have hurt me. I tell myself its time to move on. But the next minute I am filled with rage again and I do not know why I cannot let it go. I feel angry, sad and sorry for my younger self. Up and downs",0
"I have been spiraling for some time now. Now my boyfriend is finally ready and actively thinking about leaving me and moving out. I am trying everything I can and I am scared. Hes all I have. If I lose him I lose my reason to live. I have been in love with him for 6 years. I have not been this suicidal in a long time and I am honestly looking for a reason to not end it, before I even get an answer from my boyfriend. I am a fuckup what else can I say. I fucked up my last relationship by being a controlling abuser (not intentionally) and I thought that I fixed it, but i was wrong. Really wrong. Then the anxiety meds I started taking, helped my anxiety but made my aggression get worse and just worsened my relationship. I am now cleaning the house while sick to my stomach while hes crashing at a friend's house (has been for 4 days) in the Hope's that maybe hell come home and change his mind.Kill me now before I kill myself. Please. I do not know what I am doing anymore",1
"let us just get straight to it. My dad is an alcoholic. He has been to rehab SIX TIMES. SIX! He has been drinking even before I was born, and he continues to drink to this day. he is drunk right now. When I was 11, I was in baseball, and one day, he showed up at my baseball game completely drunk. I was so embarrassed, and really really hurt. After the game, teammates were making fun of me: ""Hey, I really like your dad. He seems fun."" ""Hey, when is your dad coming to the game next?"" ""Your dad is a real wino."" I was hurt, but, I had to go to the next game, and when I did, one of the teammates brought a can of beer, gave it to me, and said ""I know your dad will love this."" I asked my mom if we could leave. I told her I was not feeling well.I went home, and decided to quit baseball. I told my mom that it was because I was not having fun, but, in reality, I did not want to keep playing because I did not want to keep being bullied by the other kids, and being embarrassed whenever my dad showed up drunk.My dad continued to drink. About 6 years ago, my brother and I visited him for Christmas. I thought it would be nice. On Christmas Eve, he said he was going out to the store. Usually it is about a half hour walk. (He lost his drivers license due to a DWI) He came back, FIVE HOURS LATER, absolutely hammered. On Christmas Eve. I was furious. I wanted to leave, but, I did not want to ruin everyone is Christmas. So, I kept my mouth shut, and cried myself to sleep. Worst christmas I have ever had.I stopped talking to him after that. I ignored his texts, and I came up with excuses to avoid speaking to him. In September of 2019, my supervisor told me she would have to cut my hours. No reason given. I was barely making any money to live on. I could not pay my bills, and for a while, I had to park my car, and walk to work because I could not afford insurance. So, my dad decided to move in with me, and said he would pay the bills.I was really upset with this decision. I did not want him to move in with me, but, I had no other choice. Ever since then, I have had to deal with his drinking. CONSTANT DRINKING. I have screamed at him, and pleaded with him to stop drinking, and he does not listen. I have even grown to dread the sound of a can opening.About 3 months ago, my 17 year old little brother came over. My dad decided to get shit faced. He was acting like a dick, and was just being obnoxious. My brother ended up leaving, and went home. My mom texted me, and told me he came home crying. My 6 foot 7 inch tall brother, who weighs 280 lbs, cried because of my dad's behavior.On Monday, my dad decided to start drinking at 11:45 in the morning. 4 hours later, and plenty of beers later, he asked me to take him to the store. I was hesitant, but, I took him. We get inside, and already my father is embarrassing me. I go off to get what I needed, and I realized I forgot my wallet in the car. My dad pays for me, and I thanked him twice for that. I paid him back when we get back in the car, and we head home. On the way home, my dad starts acting like a dick. He starts mocking me, and going ""thanks for the money, dad."" Even though I thanked him twice. I was on edge at that point. I responded ""I already thanked you twice, you idiot."" Was it the best thing to say? No. But, I was really upset. He got upset for me calling him an idiot. We get home, and I am walking up the porch. He throws an empty bottle at my head; and that was it. I had snapped. I turned, walked down the steps, and approached my father, and punched him right in the jaw. I knocked him out. He was out for a good 3 minutes.He regained consciousness, and I helped him inside. I do not really know how to feel about it, though. I feel good for standing up for myself after dealing with a dismal father. But, I also feel terrible because he is my father. I really do not know how to process all of this. Even 2 days later. I punched my father.",0

I have enough knowledge to take my own life in way too many ways for my own good but i have no idea why I have not gone through with it yet, my best guess is i am afraid to fail suicide, just like i failed every other thing in my lifeI was raped 4 times as a kid and nobody know about it. I have panic attacks upon the sight of a police officer due to wrongful imprisonment and deportation. I go days without eating otherwise i cannot afford rent. I suck academically after i used to be top 5% nationwide. Depression fucked me over and i cannot seem to think of any other way out except ending it all. I had enough",0

"Hello guys this is my first time making a post and first time talking about this but I felt comfort in the anonymous environment, so firstly I have been having feelings of sadness and loneliness for a while now maybe a couple years and I just feel like I cannot trust anyone even my closest friends of years and years of friendship because I am so scared of being left venerable and sometimes I just feel like all the shit inside me just gets to a point where it blocks the light at the end of tunnel and sometimes I just feel like I am in a room enclosed by sandstone and my tears slowly erode away the stability and one day its all going to collapse and I am going to try and kill myself again but the thing is I do not want to, all I want is to have my old life back where I could wake up and look forward to the future instead of now where when I wake up I just think of how shit I am of a person and how worthless I am, for some fucking reason I have mentally tortured myself into thinking I need to protect people and if I cannot be there for the people I care about I am better off dead, but to be honest I do not think anyone would notice or care, and sometimes I feel like i cannot trust(as in be around them) or even talk to anyone because at any moment they might throw me under the bus, I find myself always looking over my shoulder and its eating me inside. I am really hell bent on joining the military to get away from this place just so I can go die a death that will not make other people think how much of a worthless piece of shit I am, and recently I have been really abusing drugs to numb everything like how I am using weed a lot more combined with alcohol and sometimes the harder drugs just so I can numb my body and feel maybe a inch of happiness, I do not know what I am going to do probably just go end it because I do not see myself getting any further I do not know what to do anymore",0

"You are not alone, trust me. We all face our hardships, we each have our own individual struggles and issues. We may feel alone, not loved, and gotten to the point where suicide/self-harm is the best solution. Well trust me, it is not. I have come a long way myself, as I am sure you guys have as well. We need to take it one step at a time. On my twitter, I post frequent motivational quotes and nice messages, with funny ones, and I am beginning to work on a massive group chat/server where everyone alike can realize they are not alone. They are loved and have a lot going for them even if they may not realize. I never had anyone, nor do I have anyone right now. I have come to the realization I will never have anyone, but that does not stop me from smiling, because helping others makes me smile. My goal is to help and prevent many people from falling in the endless blackhole that I have experienced. If anyone is interested, lmk :)If we never meet again, just know you are an amazing person and you need to realize time is the best medicine.

"I have always had suicidal ideation, perhaps, since my puberty. My mental health got worse and I finally got diagnosed with bipolar in my freshman year of college. I tried counseling, psychiatric drugs, etc. and none of them seems to help. Yes, they suppress my episodes, but the thoughts of dying never go away.I guess the fact that I got interested in social science in college and got into a study group in that regard, despite studying medicine, does not help either. I guess those school of thoughts saying that ""existence is pain, life is meaningless"" etc. does not do well for a suicidal person, eh? In this regard, damn do I wish I can be a devout Christian like my parents. They seem to hape some sort of hope in God throughout their life. Unfortunately, I just cannot do that.Studying medicine, in regards of my suicidal tendency, is a mixed bag. To some degree, it helps me prevent actually committing suicide. Knowing how painful the process can be, its failure rate, etc. I want to die, you know, and it has to be graceful. I do not want to die in pain, life is already painful. I already tried overdosing myself with benzos and failed, only to end up slurring some personal secrets (ie. my homosexuality, my sex activity, etc.) to my parents which stirrs up our relationship in a bad way. Nevertheless, on the other hand, I keep trying to find a perfect way of committing suicide with the knowledge I know: figuring out drugs' lethal doses, its toxicity characteristics, etc. It definitely does not help.As of now, I am currently under that spiral. I have been trying to find the perfect suicide method on the internet for the past two days. Finding means to die and orchestrating my hypothetical death. Maybe I am on my episode again; I do not know. I quit taking my prescribed drugs and going to psychiatrists for almost a year under my parents' pressure. Moreover, those drugs do not do well for me; the side effects are just unbearable. I am already considering admitting myself to psych ward at this point, but as I am currently escaping from them and have no plan seeing them in the near future, I do not think it would do. Furthermore, my established hatred of psychiatric drugs and what not, to my thoughts, would only make things worse, no?I have no one else to ask for advice. All people I talk to has never really helped. Sure, they do care about me to some extent, but they ended up only wanting to stop me from dying without even addressing what the problem is, which to me is only means of distancing themselves from the liability. Therefore, I would really love to hear your two cents from my story.For mods, I have tried reading this sub's rules and I do not know whether if this post breaks any of them. I am really sorry if it does. I do not wish anybody harm, I never do. *random title*",1
"I have been through so much. I am a strong person so it really has been too much. At some point I thought I was meant to commit suicide because I just could not understand why. I felt like a little dog being beaten up by a psychopath human. Only I was the dog and God was the human. So you can kill me God, I give up. I know it would bring a smile on your wicked face. You asshole. You can just kill me God, it is ok.",1
"Do I, a privileged, loved, white woman raised in upper middle class, who grew up with a stay at home mom, who always had food in the fridge and vacations now and again, who had supportive parents who did not split, who got straight A's, who considers herself of average attractiveness, and managed to provide an independent adult life for herself, have the right to crave my death?This, for the love of all things good in the world, is a humiliating, but honest question.Basically, I feel like an outdated computer that keeps trying to load malware, but the virus keeps crashing the system. So I am either tiptoing around the infection, or trapped in a blue screen of idle discontent.Do I even actually want to die? Or do I crave death as an alternative to improvement? And if that is true, when exactly does my brain recognize plan A is not working? How will it know its time for plan B? Why does it keep trying to load the malware? It did not work the first 9,036 times, why does it keep putting faith in the next time? Or the next time? Why does this thing in my skull long to self destruct so badly? And why will not it just fucking do it already? WHY DOES IT FUCKING HATE ITSELF GOD DAMMIT!?Fuck. Where did the virus come from?Is it my fault?Did my childhood imperfections pave the way for this emptiness? Was my introverted, anti-social nature that did this to me? Did I learn too late in life what it meant to remove yourself from the center of your universe, resulting in an unrelenting and perpetual social anxiety? Did my insatiable appetite fuck my brain up? Did my perfectionism -that sweet sweet desire to do great things, and that destructive and sociopathic hatred of mediocrity- permanently damage my ability to feel content or patient? Did I hurt someone, or say something, or watch something long ago that awoke a darkness in me?Or is not my fault?Was it the indoctrination of that fucking church that told me to pray and repent the scars on my wrist? Was it my gas-lighting mother who dramatized every god damnable phenomenon on this planet? Who would preach love and tolerance, and also how unbiblical and repulsive ""the gays"" are, and how ""the blacks"" need to stop popping out babies for the welfare? Was it my brother who treated me with what can only be described as an angry hatred for existing, for some god damned reason, for the first 16 years of my life? Was it the friends I longed for? The friends I did not long for? Did I think too highly of myself? Or not highly enough? Was I lazy? Or did I exhaust myself? Why do I feel guilty and ashamed of myself all the time?Fuck I do not know. I am not sure I care to anymore.All I know is right now, in my weakest moments, defeated, alone, selfishly resentful of this infected brain, and ""blue screened,"" all I want is to turn it off. I want to be thrown against the wall and destroyed for being defective. Because in real life, you do not get to reset yourself to factory settings. If the malware does not take, what the fuck do you do to remove the virus?If you are still here, please know I am so sorry. I am so fucking sorry for being here. If you are still reading, please know this sadness, this euphoric and liberating sadness, is my empathy for you, my precious brother or sister, as undeserving as I am to have it. I hurt with you all. And I am so thankful to you for allowing me to.I will finish with this.As long as I can remember I have hated myself. And I do not admit it to anyone because I do not have the right to. I do not have the right to my anxiety. Or my anger. Or my insecurities, fears, inadequacies, or sadness. Not when I read your stories. Your fucking beautiful and tragic stories. Where do I get off taking up your precious space with my problems? Problems so profusely unproportional to the feelings they convey.I want to launch plan B. But I do not want to give up on plan A. it is so infuriatingly conflicting. Especially when plan A exists in a near constant blue screen realm of existence. But hey, maybe 9,037th time's the charm. Do I have the right to my mental deficiencies?",1
"This is just a rant. I do not have anyone I can really talk to atm. Fun fact when you are depressed and overshare with friends they tend to stop contacting you. Anyways this line I have been riding for awhile is reaching an end. Today I found myself talking to my coworkers of all people about the best ways to commit suicide. Hell it was more of a cry for help I think but what do I know I am not a doctor. Idk the intrusive thoughts are one of the few things that actually give me a sense of comfort anymore. To be frank I might have a year, maybe two. I just cannot keep this up. I do not have anyone in my life and it seems like I am beyond repair. Those are just my thoughts though, then again I am mentally unwell. Like I said I just needed to put this out there because frankly I am sick of waking up everyday. I just want this to be over.

"Since I was in quarantine and homeschooling my social skills got worse and worse. I used to be funny and knew how to start a conversation out of nowhere. The boys of my friendgroup started to seek a different group than mine so I was really pissed because they had no time for me anymore. I really tried to forgive. I am still trying to forgive them. it is just... I just cannot. They left me in my phase where I needed friends. I even told them that I need them. But nothing changed. They even forgot my birthday that we spoke about 2 days earlier. I just feel like I am worthless. Now their group ripped apart because of really fucked up shit and it is no surprise that they are with me again. And as I said I just want to forgive. Somehow. But I.. I just cannot. Something in me says it cannot. We met again, we played games again but somehow... it is not the same. I am always nervous and somehow frustrated when I am with the boys. It get's better after some time but if I think about the past again, what happens often, I am in a downphase again like now. Tomorrow is the birthday of one of my friends. I will congratulate him but there is just something inside me that makes me constantly angry when I think about his birthday. There is something that makes me sad when I think about my friends. My relation to my other friends, who are girls, is fine I guess. Even though my overthinking and lack of conversation skill really damaged it I think. I just do not have the strong bond I used to have. And I am never sure if it is me or the friend. They have problems too because of the whole lockdown thing so I am pretty sure that it is mostly because of this. But way too often my thoughts are not the same that I am feeling what makes some days really hard. After all I think they like me in a way but then there is my overthinking. Every word they say and every movement just triggers something inside me. I immediately think about it and take it as an insult or think of a sign that our relation is bad. And I think that is the actual thing that destroys my relations and I just do not know how to handle... I just do not want to loose them... I just do not have clear thoughts and wanted to vent a bit... This is so confusing for me and I do not know how to handle my feelings. Do you have same kinds of feelings and thoughts? Do you have ideas how to handle them? I wish you guys all the best with every problem you have.

"I spent my childhood putting all my energy into surviving emotional abuse from my parents and I have spent whole years of my life completely alone with minimal human contact (basically just my immediate family and the odd delivery person) so despite nearly being 28 years old I have not developed the same social skills most people my age have (for example I have had sex exactly one time and I have never been in a relationship), this lack of social skills has caused problems in my relationships with people to the point where not understanding the full subtleties of situations has destroyed my reputation in some circles and even cost me employment, thinking about the problems I have caused for people just makes me want to shut out the world and hide from everyone, but speaking from experience being away from the world for long periods of time makes my mental health worse and further erodes my nonexistent social skills, so I force myself to work, make friends and go out despite the constant existential dread I feel in the background, I know I am burning the candle at both ends here and eventually I will probably snap and go back to my reclusive lifestyle but I see no other way forward but to force myself out of my extremely limited comfort zone and try to have as much of a life as possible even though it gets more and more stressful to maintain as time goes by I have this constant overwhelming urge to become a recluse",0

"I cannot afford health care, college, a car, or to survive on my own in general. I cannot get a job without being overwhelmed by every single thing. I have narcissistic parents and even my therapist cannot come up with ways to spin this anymore. I just got out of psych hospital 3 days ago and I am already prepared to go back. Maybe this is a sign its finally over. If I had a dollar for everytime my life got worse, Id actually be able to fix my problems",1
I do not mean anything to anybody and I have no future everyday is hell and I cannot handle it anymore I feel like there is only one escape and everyday I get closer and closer to doing it and one of these days it is going to happen. I feel like death the only way out,0

"First of all, why do we live? For like having a good time? I do not think that is the point. All the evolution which made today's circumstances does not look like to point it. It is so obvious for me after spending my whole life just thinking about stuff, it is all about picking side. Sides of this war between life and death are pretty obvious, yet so hard to see. Either you choose life and fight with the problems that other side put in your life or accept the loose and side with them. Everyone I know think that they are in the life's side. Little they know, it is been so long that they bowed their head to death. Everyone is painting the truth with their lies along with their desires. They just do not want to loose to death so they let the scummers do their job. The world built by human is literally built for the people have power to keep and raise it. Majority of others is ok with it because their only hope is to be in or getting close to those positions. Than what? What would they do if they reach to thier dreams? Sadly, same... They are just fillers who accetped their exintance in that way. No different than any material in the world. Even their behaviour has no freedom to choose other. It is like we all at a cliff and all we can think about is to use others to make us a safe zone. Why we do that if there is an obvious cliff that screams ""nothing"" from below. We all serve to nothingness while we think ""we are doing our best"" to aviod it. So I want to ask again, why do we live? If I will face with nothingness, what does matter about what I do in my life time? What makes something right or wrong? Adding values on it? Because no matter how you live deeply your life, every value made by us destroyed same way. But before that I have to explain what I mean by fight between life and death. Life comes from nothing, and makes something. Death comes from something, and makes nothing. When life try to find ways for not being reachable for death, death tries to find a way to stop life's movement. Like a heart rate, it kept the universe this way to us today. Every decisions we make comes from one of them. It is so heartbroken to see everyone choosing death's side. Because creating is hard work, if you going to do hard work it is better to do what is obvious and served, so everyone falls to the net of the death which is hanging on the cliff. They think it is safe and they covered, but little they know its all part of the plan to ending our existince. I am not delusional neither consiparcy person, it is what is going to happen in the long run as far it seems ... What is a valueable? Is it money? Is it water? Obviusly, whatever we need has a value. The value can change along with the circumstances. For example, life. Life is most valuable thing we have right? I guess not. Because it is only valuable if it means something to someone else. Otherwise, no one cares. It can be person who loves you or can be person who wants to use you. Rather than those, it only has value for you, if you think it is valuable. So here is the question, does your life valuable for you? It is simply a potential source. You could use it to have things, but that is just a possibility. Most of the time people pass before they satisfied with their gains in exchange with their life's. This is why most of the people who wants to suicide because they do not want to be other side of the fight neither to see that they are loosing. I am having the same problem, why do I live if I am going to end up with nothingness with all those pain, only gain is here to have less pain? It is pretty logical to me, but really hard to decide. What is the real problem than? Is it everyone choosing the winning side or is it that there is no hope for the other side? This makes me depressed because I am pretty sure that nothing could beat an honest mind. If the life is able to come from nothingness, than nothing can defeat it. Death is just there to us for improvement, not to make us giving up. We could colonize whole universe and that could be just a freaking beggining. We could choose to be anything yet we choose to be worst. I have no power to change it all, I wish I could live my life by chasing my dreams. Sadly it is not allowed and I am exhausted. I had so much energy, so much willpower but they all been sucked by monsters to place me next to other billions of lost existances. Hope you find a way to fight with it, it seems I will not be able to hold on in close future. I have questions",1
"I am such an unnatural freak, I should be dead. I cannot function like a human being and that makes me feel like garbage, like there is something wrong with me. I do not understand.

"Not to double post but this time I really really fucked up. I have had suicidal ideation for years but I never went through with it. I almost did, but I did not because my current boyfriend asked me out a few days before I was going to, but I have never told him that out of fear of being manipulative.Just to clarify were in a poly relationship so its me, him, and my gf. My last post explains it more but I have unintentionally hurt her and I do not know if its forgivable. Considering just running away across the country and then killing myself. I have always wanted to see the west coast and I might as well have one nice experience before I die. I am trying to figure out how to plan it. I am 18 but live with my parents (was going to move in with my partners in a couple months but they are both upset with me so idk if that will ever happen) Ill be dead anyways before that happens. If I disappear will I be forced to go home? Thrown into a mental hospital? (We cannot afford it anyways) My mom is working night shift, my dad and siblings are about to sleep. I have tonight to start planning things out but I do not know what I am doing. there is no step to step guide for suicide so I am not surprised, I have never been a too impulsive person so it feels strange to take the leap. I know I only have a little bit of doubt because part of me is still convinced that they will not break up with me after what happened. But even if they do not I deserve thisIf anyone comments I already know I am going to see stuff like try therapy or talk to someone or meditate and exercise and eat healthy1. I have no access to therapy and my family is against it.2. I have tried talking to family and friends, it never helps3. I do plenty of things like that, but its never improved my mental health.I have trauma starting from age 6 and multiple undiagnosed mental illnesses plus autism and an eating disorder. Its not that easy Tired of hurting people",1
"I am going through a pretty rough time. In the morning when I wake up I just feel a sort of dull sadness, and I am very listless as I go about the morning. Then midday hits and I am just completely down. No energy, nothing cheers me up. Then as the sun goes down I start getting that panicky sad where I feel like I am just going to burst into tears at any minute. Its the same pattern every day and I cannot stand it. Is this normal? Is it normal to feel a certain kind of sad in the morning and a different kind as the day goes on, in the same pattern consistently every day?",0
"she would not cope with a new owner.I had her in boarding while i was on hospital, and she stopped eating because she was so stressed without me. I cannot do that to her. The only reason i do not kill myself is my cat",1
"As the title says, I feel defeated. Ready to just end my life and never have to worry about this constant cycle of stress, only to see a glimmer of hope that gets crushed as soon as you think it is safe to reach for it. It genuinely feels like life, for me and people like me, in this society specifically, is only granted to prove that hope truly is not viable and that our lives and our beings are merely stepping stones for the more lucky.I used to genuinely love people. Deeply, unconditionally love people. I still do, but I hate to admit that because it makes me naive and open for hurt. And it extends to most all people, and before I could handle the fact that people are imperfect, that is fine, I can still handle that. I still feel that love for people in my life, even despite terrible low points. I have always been able to forgive, and distance, and move on if wronged. Not wishing bad on those who wronged me. I still do not. But that changed these past few years. I went into a deep depression, and I still have not gotten over past trauma my dysfunctional family inflicted on me. That they still inflict. Because I love them, and I forgive them and recognize what they did was wrong but I still care about them because we are all only human on this planet. there is always a reason and meaning, and people have good in them most of the time. If they do not expand it, I just distance but still wish for them to change and do what is best. So I distance, but the distance does not fix my mental state, or the distrust and pain that plagues me and my current relationships to others. I am secretive. I find that to be my biggest downfall. I never allow myself to be truly open, and I lock away deeply intimate parts of myself and the things I enjoy and love personally. I never share my writing, the things I enjoy most, or my media preferences. Even though it is all harmless, I keep it under wraps, and I know it is due to trauma from my upbringing. I can link it distinctly. Nobody would expect my death, and I know they would not because even my partner has no idea how debilitating my mental health gets. And it makes me angry, I feel burned. I am not able to be myself. I am not able to honestly connect with those in my day to day life. I was forced to hide most everything about me growing up, lest it be suppressed or judged harshly or used to hurt me. And I cannot do it anymore. I have lost so much of myself that I will never find those pieces again, to put myself back together whole. Words are only a temporary distraction before it all comes down to crush me again. And, for that, I know that without the 24/7 distractions of other people and work and hobbies I cannot function. I am not whole on my own, mentally or physically, I feel. My cousin committed suicide 5 years ago and it is like a mirror and some days I envy them. I envy that they escaped, and I hate myself for even being capable of thinking that way. I feel like a hypocrite, for thinking of doing what I have begged and convinced others not to do.I am currently unemployed due to the pandemic. Started taking care of a stray, now I have kittens to take care of as well. I cannot drive due to disability, which makes things harder, I feel too burdening on my partner. So I push myself into freelance work, up keeping everything to a high standard, never taking a break from videos or auditory outlets as I work, always distracting myself. But it is all a distraction, and I am wearing on them when they ask about what is wrong and I open up about my mental health or have anxiety attacks or mental breakdowns.""Why are you like this / Why do you have to be like this?""""I cannot stay in this relationship if you cannot get better.""""Why is something always wrong with you?""""cannot you do this later / Why do you have to do this right now?"" ""What the fuck do you expect me to do / What the fuck is wrong with you now?"" And so I keep it all down, I suppress it, and I feel physically awful all the time. Chronic migraines, I never get a break where my mind is not trying to distract itself or is not in an existential dread or downfall. it is not worth living like this, even as much as I love my pets and partner and family. I do not want to leave them but I feel I have to. I wish it was like the romanticized versions of mental health issues. Where your partner holds you and tells you it will be okay, instead of the reality of your partner getting stressed and cracking every now and then and yelling and making it worse and saying hurtful things that come back around the next time, no matter how hard you try to forget it. When I get like that, being held and told it is going to be okay sounds like something otherworldly and heavenly and amazing. I really want to end it all, especially knowing that I will never have that. I have had that maybe a few times, and only after being torn down, only after the person who has the misfortune of seeing me like that calms down. Even then, they never learn a better way to handle it, or listen to me or care to remember when I try to get out what I need and how to handle the situation (I say what my therapist has told me to tell others, it does not work) because I guess they all forget. it is a cycle of pain, relief at last, and then forget. Then repeat. Constantly. And I am too weak to handle it. there is good reason for me living. I know if I passed many would miss me greatly and my pets would likely be confused or miss me as well. I do not want that to happen, I suppose, but I want to end this constant suffering and that seems like a small price to pay. Though I also do love being sentient and conscious, I love listening and seeing and hearing new things. I love learning, and in this world and universe there is so much to learn, I could spend a lifetime doing so, even though I may not have access to formal higher education I have a phone and access to videos, lectures, news and studies. That might be worth sticking around for, but I only love it so much because it is a distraction from my deeper troubles. So why dwell in it and continue the distraction? Even when I write this stuff, it makes me cry hard because towards the end I realize how much I enjoy life and living, and I realize how hard and near incapable I am of doing so fully. It makes me feel shattered and bleak. Why even write it at all?It feels like I cannot even trust my own brain anymore. I already cannot trust it. Why even go on if I cannot trust my own brain? I just want to be happy like I was before. I feel defeated",1
"I am not so sure that I want to live to be 70-80 years old, especially since both my grandmothers had horrible alzheimers disease. I am suffering way too much. I go to bed every night reliving the same horrible nightmares about drowning and being chased by serial killers. I have been mentally and sexually abused throughout my whole life and am still being abused. And I am not sure if there is still a reason for me to keep moving forward. I try to look for plenty of reasons to live, but all the damage that has been inflicted onto me since I was a child is irreversible. I am broken beyond repair. And I am sure I am going to continue getting worse with each year that goes by. My health is failing. I am drowning inside my mind. But then I think to myself, why would it matter if I died anyways since most people do not even know that I exist? I will go back to being nothing again anyways. Life is probably just an illusion. Sometimes I want to die, but I am too afraid to know what death will feel like",1
"Throwaway account. Bit of a rant, bit of a question. Since I was ten years old, I have been pretty depressed and have always wanted to kill myself. I have also struggled with self hatred and anxiety as well as body dysmorphia and some eating disorders. For years my parents and the people around me have thought that everything was alright. And with those expectations, I hid my depression and pretty much just suffered. I have a good life with loving parents and family, and I struggle with reconciling my depression with my good life. What I am worried about is the effects of this down the line. Has having depression from such a young age going to fuck me up? Will this stuff effect me developmentally? I have been severely depressed since I was a little kid and I still am. Is this going to have worse effects down the line?",0
Long story short 5 years ago my friend high on cocaine and drinking got into a car accident from running a stop sign on a country road. His neck broke instantly causing a instant death and mine fractured amongst other injuries and even to this day I live in pain. It took a long time before I was even told my friend was dead.Got a settlement for it. Wasted it all gambling. I literally gave the worth of my dead friend away to crooked casino owners. He would have wanted me to do better with it.I guess I just miss him and feel at fault.Check other posts for more of what is going on in my life.. just this alone makes me want to die I miss my friend and I feel at fault Friend died in car crash next to me PTSD,1

"I lost my business because I did not want to work with a man who physically hurt me. He messed with my car. He caused legal issues in my life. I fell for more bullshit today which means I am still an easy mark for his cons which makes me paranoid about starting another business. He told me crazy shit about the man I am in love with and everyone wants it to my fault. I lost my job because I fell in love with my boss, and he has a girlfriend who continues to make my life a living Hell. This woman has ruined my life medically, financially, emotionally and worse. I have an ex who filmed me giving her a blowjob to hurt me and the man I am in love with. She convinced my dad to financially cut me off, and worse. She told my coworkers that I am schizophrenic and worse. She may or may not be responsible for 2 cars being totaled. She cyberstalks me and prevents me from getting work done. I have another ex who wants everything I do to be about some symbolic bullshit that means I still love him, which has also made my life a living Hell. My friends think I want to fuck their boyfriends because I fell in love with my boss who has a girlfriend, and she is now convinced them that I love all their boyfriends. Embarrassing moments of my life have been publicized - including pimple popping, showering, masterbating, etc. I just do not want to be made fun of for it. The man I am in love with would not care if I died. I do not know how much of my life is a lie. I do not know if I buried my cat alive because of these people.

"I have suspected I had ADHD since I was around 11 or 12. Never spoke up, just tried to live with it. Self harmed during middle and high school, before tapering off during college. Finally saw a psychiatrist and got diagnosed at 25. Meds help a little, but my skills are terribly broken. I struggle with everything from time management, object permanence, impulse control, planning. My daily struggle is spent procrastinating on taking my meds, being productive for a few hours, starving myself because I cannot find the will power to get up and cook when I am hungry, beating myself up mentally for wasting a whole day again, and promising myself that the next day wikl be better. Eating is a chore because I hate sitting down to plan, but grocery shopping without a plan is tough, and deciding what to cook on a whim every single day from my limited and random ingredients is a chore. And that is before I mention that I have no dishwasher so dishes are constantly piling up. I do not think I am depressed. I would love to give life a chance. I would love to find the right meds, and therapy that helps me live up to my potential. I know it is possible, because I have many friends with ADHD who have gotten their symptoms tamed enough that they are all living productive and meaningful lives. Yet, I feel so behind because they all got diagnosed in grade school, and have at least a decade of treatment that I do not. I do not feel like I can wait 10 years. I am impatient. I want results now. I have struggled for so long, that I cannot accept the fact that I have to keep struggling even though I am in treatment. I know I should just put up with the pain I am in, and trudge through my difficulties, but I keep seeing suicide as a get well quick scheme. I know it is not a great idea, and I really do not want to cut my life short, but I also hate having to struggle every single day of my existence. I have never known a day of peace, so I keep thinking about how nice it would be if I never had to deal with ADHD again. I wish I had more options beyond living the struggle, or giving up the fight. ADHD makes my life unbearable",1

"I am 18(M), I was born to a well to do family and I enjoyed all the luxuries my parents offered me, I over enjoyed most of those luxuries to a point where I think I am spoilt(I am the only child to my parents), my parents were never strict, they would be mad for a short while if I had done something bad but overall a very loving parents. So two months ago my long distance girlfriend broke up with me, I have bipolar disorder and I was in my depression phase during that time. At the same time my university started with 2nd semester, I was very depressed because of the break up and I did not attend any classes(online) for more than 2 months(I know I am stupid),Today I got a phone from the head of department saying I am terminated from the university, my parents do not know about this yet, they also told me to bring them to meet the principal and head of department to collect my certificates and stuff.I do not want my parents to know that I have committed such a horrible thing, it would be an insult to my parents that they have raised me till this age only to hear I have been kicked out of university for missing classes, I lied to them saying I was attending classes regularly but in reality I was crying because of a breakup and my usual depression because of being bipolar, I do not want my parents to humiliated because of their son's grave mistake when they go to collect my certificates. I do not think my parents would forgive me for this one.I have not got any other choice other than ending my life, I have lived my life to the fullest in many ways so it will not be so worrying for anyone, I am sorry dad, I am sorry mom I never was a perfect child you wish you had, I am just a disappointing piece of human garbage who does not deserve to live.I have written my suicide letter mentioning the reason for my sudden demise for my parents to read, I do not want to see them bow down because of my mistake.English is not my first language so sorry if it was bit annoying for wrong grammar.Goodbye world, I thought I would live my life to the fullest and travel around the world, unfortunately due to my own foolishness I have to depart at the age of 18. Love you dad and mom I would really miss you guys, love you all my friends and other family members I hope you guys do well in your lives, love you my ex girlfriend, I am not pissed or angry on you, it is your right to choose what is good for you and not and my death is no way because of you it is all my fault for being this foolish, I hope you do well in your life as well. This might be a strange post, this is all my feelings coming together, this is how I feel right now before making the move, it is very overwhelmingly difficult to do this but I have not got any other choices.Thank you for reading kind internet stranger, goodbye.

"Ok. So I am at that weird age where people are either dying mainly due to overdoses, accidents and occasionally suicide or they are getting married, settling down and starting families of their own. I look around at all my friends getting married and having kids and I think why cannot I be normal and want that? Instead my days consist of a tiring and constant uphill battle with depression. My friends are starting families and all I want to do is die because honestly I think that this world sucks. Then when I see that they are pregnant I cannot help but feel sorry for the unborn child. I think to myself who would ever bring an innocent child into this hell world? Although I know that is just the depression talking. All I do is work and then sleep so that I can escape from my own mind for awhile. There have been times where I have felt so awful that I have literally cried myself to sleep. And then sometimes I have to take Valium or Benadryl so that I will not dream because even sleep does not always bring me peace. I have actually thrown up a couple of times thinking about how I have to do this all for the rest of my life. What kind of life is that? I am afraid that I am eventually going to lose my battle with my mind and I do not want to hurt my friends and family but I also cannot go on living like this. My mind is constantly plagued by what is the meaning of all of this? Seriously I wonder who/what is considered normalthe people who welcome death because they know that life is virtually pointless and in the end nothing matters or the people settling down and starting families of their own? what is considered normal?",1
Do I have depression if I am scared to feel trapped in the feelings of being hopeless and helpless and I pour out all my emotions on my close ones and my boyfriend. like i have nervous breakdowns in front of them. because I am scared that if I do not say these feelings I will be trapped and they will eat me alive. but then afterwards I feel like a horrible burden. who do I talk to every time I feel like venting? i cannot just talk to my friends or boyfriend each time I am frustrated. people cannot handle or manage your problems like this. nor can I call up my therapist every day each time something stressful happens. Does not knowing how to manage emotions a symptom of depression? If I do not allow myself to feel guilty for being a burden because I lie to myself but then later I feel guilty for a while. then I try to push those thoughts away to feel normal and lie to myself that venting is ok. do I have depression,0
This past year has been full of negative people and negative situations. I graduated college as covid hit. Found out that was a huge waste of time and money. Almost everyday an old person tells me there is nothing to look forward to. I have been working hard and doing really great for people and their businesses yet they are very negative and only care about money and their old asses. Smoking marijuana no longer gets me high so I am either searching for a better high or searching for a reason to quit trying. How is a 23 year old suppose to make it in this world? People live so long and they are not grateful or nice to the younger generation. I have tried being hateful but I am so tired. All I want to do is smile and enjoy my time on this earth. Tired,1
"I cannot take it any longer. Growing up had his ups and downs, my family was always great.

I found out that she was having intimate conversations with some ex through social media too.I cannot be with her anymore, but cannot even imagine not being with my boy everyday.

"So basically I started cutting my wrists and some of my friends found out. They told me to stop so I said I did, it was a complete lie. I thought they had believed me. But they did not because somehow the school counselor found out. At some point people started fucking with me because for like 2 weeks straight he was calling me to his office every other day because someone kept saying I was still cutting myself, which I was not. In one of the meetings he told me that I have obviously become someone people need to worry about and that shit hit deep. I cried about it later because that made me feel so bad. It is not even the worst thing I have had said to me, but it hurt so bad for some reason. I think its because I never wanted to be the person people had to worry about. He also told my parents that they should consider putting me in a mental institution... like wtf? Things have just gone downhill from there though. COVID happened, I became overweight (Which would not be a bad thing if my parents were so harsh about it.

I just felt dead.I am falling into that hole again and I just do not care. I do not have anything to hold on to. I do not have it in me to prevent myself from hitting the bottom. Just fuck it. A failure, you have always been a failure. The other voice goes on. A failure of man. A failure of a son. Just a waste of life.I am holding in tears and I feel pathetic.This failure triggered it.

"Hello everyone, i was reading a lot of your stories and i always wanted to post something but never did because i did not want to bother anyone and i felt that i did not deserved any attention.But in some extreme efforts to try to get better, i convinced myself to do it, so here i am.Since i Can remember, i always had a lot of depression phases 2/3 times a year, but i was at maximum a month. Unfortunately, i had a big trauma in 2017, an since then, I am depressed all day. I tried some medication in a short period of Time (2 months) but i could not recognize myself as i take it. I was miserable, could not do anything and when i realized i go panic attacks that made it worth. And even After that, when i tried to stop medication, i could not stop right away because of the weaning time. So now I am scared of that but i still feel, it is the only solution.I am followed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist, so I am not on my own. Also, even if it is like carrying a Mountain, i made my life proper again. I start a formation in september in alternation, I am in a relationship and everything is going well, and he understands and help me with this, I am getting my driver license (which was hard to start because of traumatism younger) .... So it is really good ! But the more i try to move forward in life, the more i feel bad.My brain feels foggy, my heart hurts me everytime, i wake up everyday only wanting to end me and my day and i needs so much effort not to have any rewards. Everything is worst than before. I am doing sport every two days, I am forcing myself to have some sociabilisation, I am good looking, I am still clever.... But i cannot be happy and it feels like there is nothing i cannot do at this point. Even worse, people just tell me that they do not know why i feel so miserable while i got everything for me. I feel guilty not to be better, and it sadden me even more. it is an awful loop where I am in and .... I do not know how to just resist again and again, having less and less energy and being a hundreth of what i was ...Sorry for this long story, i really do not want to be a burden and i Hope that every people that come here just go better One step forward, two stepbacks",0
"I do not know what I would do without my mom honestly my parents divorced 2 years ago and since then, my mom would manipulate me and tell me my dad was in the wrong, when she was. She cheated but refuses to admit it. It did not really matter to me at the time, and it still does not. But she lies to me about mostly everything in order to make me prefer her over my dad. The thing is I do prefer her, but I say I like them both equally. She usually leaves for a week every month to manage a restaurant far away from our home, and during this time, I feel extremely empty and meaningless for some reason. I cannot bring myself to cook food, and I just feel extremely lazy. I thought that after I got a car, I would not feel this way, but I still do. I am currently 17, and college is a year away from me, and I am scared about it because I do not want to be away from my mom. I know that I should do what is best for me, but I do not know. Is this normal? And how do I ease this strong attachment I have for her? I feel meaningless and empty without my mom near me",0

I am so miserable I hate my life. I have been hiding away in my room for 5 years now straight only going to the store to grab food and come back. I do not go anywhere because i know people can smell me. Every birthday i had I sit in my room and cry. I went to the doctor and they think I am lying because my test comes back negative. but you know when you smell and other have told me I smelled as well including family.

I never been in a relationship and I want too so badly because I feel like I need human connection because I feel myself slowly slipping away each day. and it sucks because I am actually pretty not to sound conceited, because I did not even realize how pretty I was until people told me. I just hate this so much. No one understands, no matter how much i shower I feel disgusting, I have a stench so bad that I had to quit my job because my coworkers was talking about me. i literally smelled like poop. I cried everyday coming home from work and it was a really good paying job. Sorry if this is so long and I doubt anyone will read this but I really needed to let this out because I am so tired and miserable I am crying as I type this. I want to work a job, I want to have friends, I want a normal life but nothing is working. I spend all of my money that I do get on different home remedies to cure bv. I literally overdrafted my bank account $300+ just so I can buy things to help my bv but nothing does. I do not want to be like this forever and I am sad that I will. Bv is making me depressed",0

"I am 25 year old. I have had a depressed mindset since childhood. I have had bouts of anxiety before. I think it is due to the stupid upbringing of my parents.

I have no girlfriend. I am free only on sundays, but stupid weekend lockdowns here have made it impossible to shop for clothes. My clothes are mostly faded and over used. My shoes have a hole. I bought a motorbike a few months ago. I do not ride it. I want to sell it off. I do not have space for a car. Dad keeps his car stuck to him always. I make good money. But i live in a small town. There is nothing to spend it on here except shit food and alcohol. This makes me want to run away to a better place. Maybe in the mountains where life is chill. I live with my parents . My father just keeps on piling loans on me. My mother sleeps all day, cooks the shitiest food on the planet. When i try to sit for. Alk , father only talks about work , mother instantly starts asking for money/phone/ jwellery. I have stopped talking to them. I want to cook food i like it.

I have not seen anyone other than my parents in 16 months. I do not have any close friends who I can talk about my feelings to. I have a terrible relationship with my parents. They do not care that I am sad. I tried telling them about my feelings, I cried to them. My mom brushed them off and my dad threatened to beat me up in front of all my classmates. I feel left out of everything. My friends are making plans, hanging out, playing games. I am here struggling through a mountain of workload and suffocating. Toiling through 10 hrs of online classes everyday trying to keep my sanity safe. Everyone I have talked to reacts negatively whenever i try to talk about my feelings.

"I am suicidal asf from grief of brother at 18 and multiple traumas etc. Ik how bad suicidalness is and how strong that desire to kys is.

To be shown some kindness and gentleness. Just some human decency.I am so exhausted. So tired.It hurts to be alive. I thought about cutting myself but then just ended up crying and writing in my journal to vent and process my emotions.It hurts when you cannot get through to the people you love. When you show them your bleeding heart and they do not care.You are shamed for having been hurt. For being in pain.I know its not their responsibility to fix that trauma. Its mine, but god, a simple hug and I love you would not hurt.Sometimes a hug and a little reassurance is all I need.I will not end my life, because I know that is not the way.But I feel so damn alone. So unwanted. So forgotten.Its hard to carry on when my heart feels so bloody and broken. My will to live is so small right now.I am working extremely hard to love myself and fill my cup up.

"I do not condemn anyones decision to take their own life. This world we live in is truly awful and we all know it. I know how hard it is to feel desperately alone. I am just asking to please think about your loved ones before you go through with it. On July 5th my 15 year old cousin attempted suicide via firearm. Fortunately I was able to see him the day after, though in an hour or two they will take him off life support and he will pass away. Me and him had nearly identical situations growing up, and I am overcome with guilt because I just know there is something I could have done to let him know he was not alone. My grandparents have to go in and say goodbye to one of their two grandsons for the last time. My aunt and 12 year old cousin are not doing well either. My cousin has to grow up without her only sibling, her older brother. My aunt will live out the rest of her life feeling she failed her only son. My sisters have to go to bed tonight knowing that our cousin that we grew up with will not be alive when they wake up.I am not trying to dismiss anyones pain here. I know how hard it feels everyday to keep going. I have been very suicidal in the past and the idea of me giving my pain to the people i love the most, namely my two sisters, has kept me from going through with it. All I am asking here is to please think about those that love you. Please reach out, talk to someone, do what you have to do. I am a person who has struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past and now my younger cousin will be taken off life support tonight",1

I do not care about afterlife, about family sadness, about other painful stuff, ending in ED and then psych ward, but only about my boyfriend.But it is still fucking hard to keep living this hellish torture only because i do not want to make him cry.Think many can relate.

"Usually impermanence is a tool used to help people from feeling like pain and apathy are unavoidable, or permanent. Usually it is supposed to convey that change for the better will eventually come while staying alive. But Impermanence is corrupted inside me. I go about every day like any other gear in the large machine that is modern capitalism. I spend my free time alone at home, watching advertisements in my ""entertainment"" which reminds me I am never quite good enough. I get up in the morning, commute to work, listen to my boss in meetings, pay 1/3 of my paycheck to the government so the military can set piles of money on fire in faraway countries, flush half of the rest of my paycheck down the toilet paying for the privilege of shelter that is 10X as expensive as it was 40 years ago. I forego luxuries in order to put away a measly sum every year that will never grow large enough to support me in old age. I fall in line, and do just like everyone else is doing. Because if it makes me feel absolutely obliterated and rotten inside, clearly I must be faulty in some way compared to everyone else obediently and enthusiastically following the status quo. But all the while, my mind reminds me of Impermanence. When I can hardly gather a modicum of resolve to get out of bed in the morning and into work, when my heart cramps up and palpitates after a week of constant sedentary stress, when I am spending my free time sitting in my car on the highway stuck behind hundreds or thousands of other cars, listening to the radio tell me about our failure to tamp down on pollution, on climate change, on the pandemic, on the homelessness crisis, on wealth inequality, on legislative corruption, on gun violence, on anything. My mind reminds me of Impermanence. My mind reminds me that all this shall pass, not by staying alive longer and longer and waiting for the tooth fairy's salvation. All this shall pass because life shall pass. This will all be over one of these days. This is only for now...",0
"I have been pretty damn sick lately and been depressed for idk how long. But being sick, feeling this horrible misery and pain changed me. I was throwing up, dehydrated, could not breathe at times. I felt like dying. I felt like I was at my lowest. Now that I feel better, I think of the world differently. When I was sick, I set down my phone, my controller, and spent time thinking and getting real sleep. Because now that I am not sick and can be my normal self again, I cherish the world. I cherish that I can wake up and feel healthy and not vomit every five minutes. All those times I tried to kill myself feel foolish now. I was just fed up with my situation and wanted a quick and easy way out. I know that most people have a lot of really big worries and need to find a way to escape the pain. You probably hear this all the time but it will get better. The way I see it, we only got one shot in this world, so we have to make it count. we are all going to die someday and the world is going to be in a bad place when we do pass on. So during these days where we have the luxury to watch videos on devices that are sci fi by old standards, find something that makes you happy. Find a funny video, eat a meal, take a shower. Try to better yourself and live a happy life before it is all over. there is hope. I am sorry I rambled on for a bit. I hope you can take my message to heart.

"So it is currently 11:15 at night when I am writing this, so late night brain may be upping the anxiety. This is going to be a long one, but please stick with me. I am 14, and my parents have expressly forbidden any social media, and NSFW stuff. Both of these I am violating here willfully, and I do feel awful about it. Add that to my true identity as a trans girl which my parents do not know about and I do not want them to find out, a lot is riding on this secrecy. Today, though, my parents restated this ban on what I am doing, and threatened extreme punishment. I know I should really stop this, but my emotional happiness kind of depends on this account. My sexual frustration can be released, I can realize my true femininity, I can find communities and social interaction that I desperately need. The decision of whether I should keep doing what I am doing, quietly delete this account, or come clean and face the consequences is heavily weighing on me, to the point where I am actively feeling a little sick. What do I do? I really need some emotional support and advice. I know telling them is probably the morally right thing to do, but I have no way of knowing whether that will just make my suffering even more pronounced. For context, parents have said they will permanently take away all forms of screen time (my primary form of entertainment and stress relief) and my contact with friends. What do I do here? I need help in the biggest way. Moral dilemma",0

"I have been so depressed lately and I am really at my breaking point. I have never been formally diagnosed, but I know that whatever this state I am in is, is not normal. I have always been like a bit like this in a way, just never this severely. I hate my job but I need it to pay for school, I hate school but I am going just to please my family and because I feel like I have nothing else to do with my life, I have not made new friends in years because of how bad my social anxiety is and I have never had a boyfriend for the same reason, I barely talk to most of my family, I gained weight from being off work due to being in a fire and I also lost most of my hair from it. Literally nothing is going right. I have tried so many things to help myself feel better - fixing my sleep schedule, making routines, eating healthier, exercising, starting therapy, but I still almost feel more horrible than before. And I am not even getting help for my suicidal thoughts because when my therapist asked, I lied and said I did not have any. did not want to be put in a psych ward. Anyways, I know feeling better from these things will not happen overnight, but I do not think I can wait any longer. I constantly fantasize about how Id commit, and what use to stop me is fear but its scaring me that the fear of it is slipping away slowly. The only things stopping me from doing it ks the 2 or 3 people who I know would truly care. But I am starting to feel like a burden on them because of my draining my low moods must be. I just hate my life and myself to much bear. I wasted most of my youth by sitting at home and doing nothing because of my anxiety and toxic household, and now I am stuck at a job I absolutely hate and going to school for something I do not really care about just so I can say I did something with my life. I use all of my energy to pretend I am okay at work and then when I go home, I just lay in my bed and cry and waste my life even more. I am scared if I go on much longer like this Ill hurt myself. I am a 19 year old female if that changes anything. . I am at a loss and do not know what to do with myself anymore.",0
"A long story short. I have a ton of student loan debt because I had no idea what I was doing and neither did my parents and now I have been in a huge mess for the past 8 years and I cannot take it anymore. I feel so invisible. No one talks about debt. My parents do not want to help. I have worked so hard to pay the bills and keep my head above water and feel like I have nothing to show for it because throwing the money at a useless degree that I did not even need. I get so jealous when I hear peoples parents paid for their college or help them. Why am I not deserving of my parents help? Why cannot I be like those lucky people who had smart parents who were looking out for them? Even if my parents could not afford $1 towards my education, I wish they guided me and told me the school I chose would be a huge mistake. Every day I wish I could go back in time and do it all over. I regret so much Constantly wanting to die because of money",0

"Reddit removed my post from r depression which made me even worse. Visiting family major bipolar 1. I had written a whole clear message reaching out for help and now I am not as cohesive. Staying with family for holiday/my birthday. My mom triggers me and became abusive when she knew I could not leave and sent me into the worst depression/mixed episode/mania I have had for years. I plan on buying a gun when I leave to go back to my apartment tomorrow. Supposed to be 37 Tuesday, birthday was canceled because my mother is insane. Planning on ending it before the big 3-7 I have attempted suicide 5 times previous, actually died twice but they were able to revive me. I am still scared though. I am not sure if its what I truly want but I am more often wishing myself dead than not. Giving myself a final 48 hours Type it all out and had it removed",1

"I do not know why I keep doing this and honestly I do not know why I came up this way, the only thing I can conclude is that I fell in despair so deeply? Let me explain or at least try to confess you why I do what I do, because even if you will think I am weird that is okay, because yknow, not everybody DESERVE good things in life. But you DO!I am sorry if you do not understand my way of expressing myself or my bad grammar or English, that is okay because I just cannot do anything right, but English is not my native language.I always felt odd and I feel I had to fake my entire life to seem more normal possible, so maybe that is why I am here after all.I always envied people who knows what they want in life, and had a normal childhood, I do not know why, but I cannot let go my past Ill probably never will.I consider myself nothing, so If I was nothing I could be anything right? But no.I tried so hard to fit in a normal life style, taking inspiration from the people I loved, I wanted to be as closest as possible to them! But, I was just lying to myself, and things only went downhill.My family does not care about me, at all, I do not blame them, after alla I think they would be more happy with me.I look outside my window and I see everyone begin so happy.I wanted to feel happiness but everything I felt was emptiness and so much self hate.I do not blame people who use drugs or use any substance, if I had money or way to do that, I would because i refuse to live in a world with myself, at least even for fews seconds, I would like to feel something else other than emptiness.Day passed, and I tried to be positive, my mental health deteriorated, so I started to give in in my self destructive habits.I fasted, because why not? I lived in a body i hated, i world that show me Beaty but made me despise myself even more.I fasted with just caffeine tea or coffee, if I got hungry I ate some fruit.All my days where spent watching the walls or hurting myself in some way or writing in my dairy all the shitty things happened in my daily life.This was until I fainted on the supermarket, my sister and mother were so fucking bothered by this, and i felt like shit because I cannot do anything right. But after that something changed in me.I though I was dead and I felt so...blessed?But, after waking up all I was thinking was how I can get closer to it.So I stared to planning all the bad thing I could do to myself.I was quite good at it, but when a car hit me, not to the point of hurting me that bad I realised that I did not wanted to die that way.I wanted, yeah, someone who could kill me.Its so strange to think that, but, I could not help that.When I sat on the edge on my window I always thought if someone would even bother to do something to me.Killing is not easy and most of the people would know that prison is waiting for them, but its so hard to not think about it.I realised that there is nothing more than I want than someone who wants me dead, at least who wants to feel that they want to do that to me, because I would feel so alone if they would feel forced.I do not know why I would feel so worth it in this persons arms. The closest am I to death, the more i feel worth it.",0

"One day when I was 15 in my dream I saw our house we were staying in when I was the ages of 3-8. After I woke up domething hit me, there was a boy my friends brother and I clearly remembered 3 scenes that I was assaulted. I think it happened when I was 4-6. The thing is when I told this to my father he said ""you are making up fake memories and lying because you want to play the victim."" I feel like it happened and maybe there are things that I cannot remember because it is weird how I can only remember 3 things. But is it possible that I made it up? When I was a child I knew a lot about sexual things a lot. And I was obsessively worried about child abuse, rape, molestation. I was scared something could happen to my sis, me. I was scared of getting close to any man any where. Did I made it up? Am I really trying to play the victim? I do not know. It is a memory how can I be sure it is real or not. How do I know my trauma is real?",0

"Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY. I just never feel enough, be it in my family, my friendships, or my relationship. Whatever I do, I can never be good enough. At this point, I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy, all I remember is feeling sad, that is IT, THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings, I hate getting attached, I hate trusting someone, I have my mother, I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate, but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me. I lost myself and I cannot seem to find her again. It just does not get fucking easy, it is just torture. why am I never good enough?",0
My body and mind are frozen I do not know how much more trama I can endure like its my fault and nobody comes to care about me except some crusty old fucking people nobody would even give a fuck if I was not here I am just their fucking entertainment it feels like I am being raped because they humiliate the fuck out of me I just want to fucking kill myself they do not give a fuck about me and make themselves the victim.

Then I am the bad guy for wanting to killmyself and they all look at somebody else like some fucking popular depressed person not me I wish I was never born Id rather go to hell than to acknowledge a creator I want to die and never exist yeah I did say fuck all women because that how I feel Feeling like I am being raped,1
"So last weekend I was feeling sad and I tried to end my life but taking 30x 40mg Clarus, 30x 10mg Clarus, 7 25mg Adderall and about 20x caffeine pills. After I took those pills I realized I did a mistake so I made myself vomit multiple time. I had big headache for the new few days but after that is its been tolerable. The problem is since I took all these pills I been feeling extremely tired all days. I am debating going to the hospital as I cannot say its an accident since the dose is that big. Failed an Overdose last weekend and debating if I should go to the hospital.",1
"I wake up every morning wanting to die. Its the first thought I have. Recently, I have been fixated on a gunshot to the temple, but sometimes its a noose, other times I imagine jumping from the thousandth floor of a Trump tower. These thoughts and urges are obsessive, intrusive and uncontrollable. While mornings are the worst, I have to contend with these thoughts throughout the day everyday. I have to actively fight them on a near constant basis. Sometimes physically. I have stopped myself an inch short of plunging a kitchen knife into my abdomen. I have almost thrown myself onto the Trans Canada highway and I came pretty close to jumping off a few bridges. I have attempted suicide several times and have been hospitalized over ten times. I do not think about the future much, but when I do, I catastrophize. I worry about homelessness, car accidents and cancer. Living in survival mode makes it difficult to have dreams or goals. I am living day to day, hour by hour, just trying to hang on. I am grumpy, bitter and short tempered. I can scroll Facebook for hours upon hours because it dulls the pain. I sometimes watch CNN all day to cope because its absolutely mind numbing. I isolate and its hard to leave the house. I barely sleep and have difficulty feeding myself. And this is all when I am not depressed. I am usually depressed about half the year. But my suicidality is not limited to my depressive episodes. Suicide hijacks my brain regardless of mood or emotional state. When I am depressed, thoughts of suicide are a response to deep hopelessness. Suicide seems like the only way to end the endless suffering. When I am not clinically depressed, I am still suicidal. These thoughts and urges are intrusive and impulsive. They both come out of nowhere and replace all shades of negative emotion. Instead of feeling irritated, I become suicidal. Annoyed? Suicide. Disappointed? Death. There is no middle ground. Its all or nothing. Black or white. Live or die. This has been my life for the better part of a decade. there is not much help for people like me. Antidepressants do not work. Nor do most other types of medication. And the hospital makes me feel worse. There is a lack of empirical data to suggest that hospitalization reduces suicide risk and it may actually increase the risk over the long term. Besides, the best advice emergency room doctors can give is to distract myself with activities that I enjoy. The only problem is that I have not enjoyed an activity in years. Or they suggest calling a friend. I ran out of those years ago. The only real treatment for a person like me is dialectical behavioural therapy: an expensive, involved and complex treatment that can take years to complete and master. I have dropped out of three such programs which is another matter altogether. DBT teaches you to manage inevitable suicidal thinking. When you have borderline personality disorder suicidal ideation is just something you may have to learn to live with. It is important to note that not everyone with BPD experiences chronic suicidality. However, 10% of BPD sufferers will die by suicide. Most people who complete DBT will learn to manage these thoughts and eventually get better. I am starting DBT again this week. Things will be different this time. I am ok. Read to the end. I am ok.",1
"First time poster so excuse my grammar and format...I met my wife about 3 years ago, fast I know but I was so happy. I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter, I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool. I think I need to be medicated...but I just cannot afford that kind of thing right now, let alone set professional help.Anyway...I just wanted to rant/vent...thanks Venting-I lost everything I ever wanted due to my own mistakes",0

They have every right to feel the way they do after the way I acted.I do not know where to go from here. I have done everything I can do to try and help them heal, and it is out of my control now. They at the very least need time away from me, so I am making sure I give that to them.I do not know what the real point of me posting this is, because I am not sure there is advice that can help my situation.

"I will not go into my whole story, but the basic details are that I am a 35 year old guy, homeowner, about 10 years into my current career (career, not job), homeowner, creative person, new first-time father... Since 11 or 12, I have experienced depressive episodes and severe depressive symptoms. it is only gotten worse as I have gotten older, taken on more responsibility, been burned more and more by people, repress my heart/desires to live a more fulfilling life and travel and take risks, etc. I have done more or less all of the conventional things like therapy, tried multiple drugs, I even was in a year-long clinical trial for an experimental drug for treatment-resistant depression, etc. For a while, I was able to travel for 4-6 weeks during the winters, and I did that for three winters in a row and it was probably the happiest I have been in years. But despite all of the good things happening in my life lately, I tend to always dwell on the really negative things, all of the trauma I have experienced, all of the devalue and discard, the manipulation and cruelty of others, the sense of worthlessness and the morose sense that nothing really matters and that we will all be forgotten one day. For the last 2-3 years, I have been really, really struggling to finally find something that works. Suicidal ideation is more or less always there, but just at different intensities and volumes depending on what is happening and how I am feeling. I have a lot to live for right now and want to be here to be a part of my daughter's life, but I have not had much if any success with mood drugs, talking to my primary care doctor, seeing a psychologist, etc. I feel like I almost have to do something dramatic like check myself in somewhere in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan and finally be taken seriously. I have always been afraid of the costs and possible intervention from police/authorities, but at this point, I have lived like this for so long, I cannot imagine living another 15-20 years like this. I hate that major depression is viewed more as a weakness and not a chronic condition that can -- and does -- kill people. Has anyone else done this? What have peoples experiences been like with hospitalization or in-patient treatment?",0

Instead of giving actual good advice I start to tell them what I think they would like to hear and I always end up saying stuff that does not make sense and its just confusing for them. I feel like shit and I just wish they could find someone who can actually give them good advice instead of sticking out with someone that does not even care about them but just wants them to shut up about their problems to go have fun.

"Just need to share this somewhere. Not sure why I feel like I need to live up to something, like I need to prove that I am capable of being successful. Despite having a chaos-free, generous life- it feels like my life peaked in high school (even though I felt just as worthless back then).Its almost like I have not been genuinely EXCITED about anything in a long time. I have not cared to try and improve myself or embrace a new project or do SOMETHING to make my life feel better.This all seems so trivial when comparing it to the problems of the world. It always feels pointless to share feeling bad about myself with people because at the end of the day, I am privileged to live such a cozy life and do not think its right to complain about my pride when others have to worry if they can feed their starving family or whether they will be harassed or assaulted today.I have picked up drawing as a hobby and I have an idea for a book finally outlined, so I have got to admit things are slowly starting to get better. I just did not know how difficult this whole self-actualization thing was going to be or why I care about it so much.******So there, I shared. Hopefully, I can start to think clearly again and worry less about my accomplishments and social status and just be happy to be alive. Thanks for listening. I hope others who feel stuck in a similar internal conflict can find peace. Realized that I am probably going to plateau for the rest of my life",0

"I do not know what to do anymore. I cannot do anything right. My mother is my biggest torment and I feel so alone. I was an accident child, and I feel like she hates me for that and for looking so much like her ex-husband, my father, who left us three years ago. I helped her do everything for the divorce, every document and affidavit - I did. But still every day she reminds me what a failure I am. And my father never speaks to me anymore I am a recovered anorexic, I have already attempted 3 times before, and I still struggle with SH/OCD. My eating disorder was a result of years since childhood being told by her to watch what I eat or no one will like me and bullying. I finally recovered in college and got a boyfriend who supports me, so I gained a bit of healthy weight. And now that I am graduated and at home all she does is berate me about my body and the things I cannot do right. I have not been eating and I am SHing again, and I feel like I am in a corner with nowhere to go. I have been searching for a job with no luck for 3 months since graduation just so I can get out of here. I cannot even speak in my home without a lecture. I only have my car and have been thinking about living in it if it means I do not have to see her anymore. But honestly I do not want to even exist - my existence was a mistake that should not have happened. Everything would be so much easier if I left this earth. I do not want to be here anymore",0
"Not bothered anymore. Super lonely working a shit job to get money I do not even want/spend. Feel like crap both physically and mentally. Why put myself through this. I have found piece with my decision to leave. However, my family will never accept it. Typical that the one thing that goes my way is a good family. I am to lazy to even write a proper goodbye note and research different methods. Some waste of time and energy. How do people do it",1

"I will keep this short. I have falled deep recently, and I feel stuck. I think about death a lot. I am just getting too tired to fight it. The only thing stopping me is my mom, because if I die, she will without a doubt kill herself. My little brother committed suicide in 2019. He was my best friend and I feel lost without him. My mom almost did not survive that, and she definitely would not survive if I died. So, here I am, feeling like a piece of shit because I want to do what my brother did and what I have always advocated against. I am such a fucking hypocrite, such a fucking waste of space. I have a very good life, and I feel like it is killing me. So here I am, just hoping it happens some other way, or that I simply do not wake up. I do not know why I am posting. Just feeling so insanely lost. Also, I unfortunately do not have insurance. I cannot afford professional help, and I am in a very backwards state that does not really have programs for stuff like this for people in my position. The only thing keeping me alive is I do not want to kill my mom.",1
so this is probably it. the next month ill spend collecting my paychecks and depositing them to a fund for a funeral. I have written my suicide note. I am re-reading my favorite books and leaving notes in each as to who to leave them to. do not know much else to do. 28 days. in the past when I have felt suicidal it was intense and emotion. i just feel calm now. its kind of like everybody said it would be. i do not know. anyways,1
"I used to be super happy and social and in the last few years I have had a few things happened that have really changed me and damaged my self esteem. I am trying to get back to where I once was, but just do not feel like I am very much fun to be around anymore. I used to have so many friends and now i feel like I have very few people who are genuine friends and want to be around me. I am not sure my friends even like me anymore. **Anyone been here?

"I have been crying in bed for like the past 3 hours listening to Phoebe Bridgers bc depression wanted to hit me like a fucking truck this morning and ruin my day. I have been struggling with a lot recently, eating disorders, self harm, depression, trauma, and so on. This fucking sucks. I just want to be able to function. I want to be able to shower and wash my hair every goddamn day instead of getting stuck in bed because everythings meaningless. And I want to be able to shower in general without having to use it as an opportunity to cry without worrying about being heard. I want to be able to eat without feeling like a failure. I want to feel like I am worth something. I do not want to have to ward off temptations to self harm every single fucking time something goes wrong. I want to stop disappearing and ghosting all of my friends for weeks because I feel like they deserve someone better than me. And I want to stop thinking about all the bullshit I have been through and blaming myself. I am just so tired of this. I do not want to feel like this anymore, but I do not know how. I have been in and out of therapy for years and its never helped, I have been on an array of meds and its never helped, hell I have even tried my hand at self medicating with some not so great things, and I think it goes without saying that that did not work either. I just feel so fucking hopeless and like this is going to be a daily struggle for the rest of my life and I do not want it. I fucking hate feeling like this",0
"I (21f) feel so unhappy. I have a mentally ill sister and growing up she was always rather abusive and cruel to me and other members of my family, especially my mother, to the point that all of us walk on eggshells around her in fear of setting off her anger. She snaps and has physically attacked me and spit on me and I was always taught to forgive her because of her mental illness, and I learned very early on that no one would ever defend me because doing so might upset her. I always prided myself on being good at handling it all, but she is about to go to nursing school and I am about to graduate college. For whatever reason, these past few months its like everything I have been internalizing my entire life just hit me like a truck and the depression has been brutal. Everything upsets me, I cannot sleep, I do not feel like myself and feel like I am trying so hard to keep up the act of pretending to be who I have always been, but I am failing. I cannot go to therapy because I cannot afford it, and I cannot tell my family because having to deal with me on top of my sister would be too much. I just do not know what to do with this hurt that I feel at every moment I need help and therapy is not an option.",0
"Every single fucking time I try and reach out to someone, assuming they are human, assuming they care because ""people are so decent bro you just need to talk"" I just get FUCKED and put into a place way worse than I was before I even knew them. People deliberately go out of their fucking way to not just reject me, but do so in the most painful and manipulative manner possible. If there is any possible way I could muster the will to keep living in my 3rd world shithole country where I am a loathed minority, I need to completely rob myself of any emotion. I need to accept that I am unlovable, will never love and that the concept of companionship is something I will never have....and that by itself is fucking making me so miserable.. I do not want to live like that. Now I am alone and all I can do is drink and cry in the middle of the night and I am tired of this song and dance. there is no way I can keep this up and I am afraid one day I will snap and actually kill myself. ""just socialize bro"" is genuinely making me want to off myself even more.",1

I was raised by my grandparents who are very old fashioned and I have adopted there ways in a sense . I know that she is the one for me . We ended as she thought we were drifting apart and now she will not even talk to me . Its silence . Its a dark void with no light no hope no happiness .

I am feeling so apathetic i cannot enjoy anything anymore, i cannot even start a new book or even a movie, i spend literally all my free time watching dumb videos on youtube that i ignore anyway since I am always staring into the void thinking about all the time I am wasting.

"i am extremely hopeless in changing how I live my life. I tried cutting my wrists a month ago and i had enough lines on my forearm to cover it all up. I regretted cutting myself but it was too late to take them back and all i could do was wait. i used a dull kitchen knife so there was barely any bleeding so i think in the back of my mind i knew i would not die but also i know now that cutting was easier and less painful than i thought. fast forward to today a thought crossed my mind of what if i died a month ago and i died from the cuts. (for reference I was on molly and acid when i cut my arm) so do i really know what went down when i was cutting? and i thought back from a month ago to now and some things pointed to that i was dead. i started having flies in the house, my mom has not gotten groceries in 3 weeks, my friends would not really talk to me unless i talked to them. life felt unreal this path month. i called the suicide prevention hotline and was put on hold about 5 times before the lady told me to call another line and that line directed me to a fucking voicemail and i had to talk to a fucking voicemail why i feel like fucking shit and i want to see if i cut wrist again with the same knife if i would bleed or not since i am sober now. who the fuck only has one person for a suicide prevention hotline, is there a fucking maximum amount of people who want to kill themselves at night? i need therapy but I am too afraid to get it due to monetary costs. i do not know what to do right now i feel fine but i feel like if i let the idea of me being dead and still living fester in my mind i might be driven to find out if i really am or not just a rant",1

after my last failed attempts in march i sort of gave up for a while but I am thinking about doing it again. my familys house has an unfinished basement and therws no ceiling in the laundry room so the support beams are exposed. I have tried hanging myseld down there before but it was when i was 15 and all i had was some cloth belts from old bath robes to make a noose with and obviously it gave out immediately and did not work. but I am 20 now so i can go buy rope and make sure it works. mmy second option would be hanging myself in the woods about a mile from my house where i go for walks sometimes but i probably would not be found for a while and I would decompose fast since its summer so my body might be gone before being found too. i also do not want to scar some innocent bystander for life. so maybe its not a good idea to do it out there afterallsorry for the rambling I am not well I am seriously considering suicide again,1

She lives in Prenont and I in Houston. she is the most wonderful girl I have met. she is grown so much from the person she was and I am proud of her. Me on the other hand, am just getting tired of lifes hardships. I lost two best friends because one of them was unhinged. I knew they were not my friend at that point when she went off on me for trivial reasons, but it still hurt coming from a best friend. I have nothing positive to offer her and I can tell she is getting tired of being patient for me. Just a massive combination of things that all oule up that make this all feel like it is not worth it. I did not ask to be born into this life.there is nothing anyone can do to change my mind.

"A bit of a long story, but please bear with me. I am a veteran and in 2001 in Afghanistan, I have got PTSD, Due to an incident that happened out there. Took me years to get better but I eventually did. When I left the services I became a nurse, and everything was going okay, and then we had this pandemic. During the midst of the pandemic due to stress/tiredness And anxiety at the way the world was going, I made a drug error. I did not kill anyone, or even hurt them, I just gave them the wrong drug. Id only been a nurse for 18 months last year. The stress of what I have done brought back my PTSD. Once I realised what Id done I reported it to my manager and she told me not to worry, and would support me. Fast forward four months, I have a disciplinary hearing and they fire me, dismissed from the trust I worked in for this one error. That was in September last year. A week after that my son (who lived with me and not his mum) it was discovered that he had abused his half sisters, who live with his mum when he was younger. So I could no longer have him at my house, as I have young daughters too. I went to the authorities about him, because his mum would not. My reasons for doing this was because I could see it coming out in the future when he was married with his own children and it would destroy his life, I think it was better off out now whilst still only young (hes 17). He said he was disgusted with himself and wish it had never happened. All this time later and I am still unemployed, as no one will hire me and I have seen my son once in a year. I am broken, no other way to put it. Falling",0

So I talk to him about it, and he says I would not collaborate with my peers (Never did breakout rooms in my entire math course), I have been handing work in late (3/19 assignments handed in late) and says I have not been asking questions (textbook word problems, have been asking). He wrote a whole essay about me needing to improve on things, but I still never said anything back. I just took it as another one of those L's. Apparently I cannot play sports without 80s and 90s.

I do not know why but I always believed that being a good student would be enough. That it would get me a scholarship. 'do not worry about money, just study hard' said my parents. They were wrong. All my classmates and friends went to college last year. I did not. I am a weak person. I looked for a job for a year and now that I got it I want to quit after just a week of working. Standing for 8 hours straight is really hard. I do not know if it is because I am fat or because I am used to studying and reading and not using my body. Maybe just because I am lazy. I work in a fabric and every time I walk past machines I got these thoughts about just ending my life, about jumping into them. No matter how much I try to stop, my head is imagining ways my body would get destroyed by these machines. It scares me. I am afraid that one day I will actually do it and someone will get hurt. For a year or two, I have been thinking about killing myself but I always have found a reason to stay alive. I even started writing stories again. It helped for a while. Not for long. I have talked to my mother and my friends about it, I have talked to a fucking psychologist. But I still feel so lonely. At one moment I want to get help and find a way to earn some money and live the life I want to. But then I realise that it is not going to work out and I want to just end it all. I am sad and angry and hurt but I do not know why. I am trying to find a reason to keep on living. But I do not know for how long I can do it. I have no idea why I am writing it. Maybe because I just want to tell someone about how I feel. I do not care. Title",1
"How does it not sound selfish to want people to notice that you are not okay? Do i have to purposely slip up on 'accident' and just show everything? it is not like you can ask someone to check up on you. That just sounds weird. People have their own lives to care about, so it definitely is selfish to ask. I am not the main priority, it is not anybody's responsibility to make sure I am okay other than mine. It is selfish, is not it. Is it selfish to want people to care?",1
"I fucking cannot though. I cannot remember a day in the past 2 years I was not drunk or smokin a bowl. I am self medicating to the point that I know its detrimental to my health, but I am scared to stop, because then Ill be sober and feel EVERYTHING. I guess I could go to rehab and try to get help there, but my lack of insurance is forcing me to continue to self medicate. its a downward spiral and idk how to stop it. I want to help myself, but I am so scared of myself at the same time. I am trying to stay sober",0
"I have missed almost every homework and quiz for my class so far, not really worried about it as I had not planned on being here for the end of the semester. That is no longer the plan and I am set to fail the course. The department does not allow makeups without documentation which I do not have. How would I go about reasoning with the professor about this. I do not want to make him uncomfortable so obviously I cannot just outright say it but how do I try to explain? I really cannot fail this course How do I explain this to my professor?",1
I am just scared about the possibility of what might come after death and if I would be punished for killing myself. I am also afraid of the pain during suicide. I want a death that is as painless and fearless as possible. In So Much Pain. Feel The Need To Be Released From This Pain,1
"My best friend who I vent to, today told me that the reason she barely ever opens her messaging apps is because she cannot deal with such depressing messages, my therapist has not helped my situation at all, none of my friends care about me, I hate my abusive family, I hate everyone, people always say ""everything is going to be fine, do not worry"", they are just lying bastards, at this point I trust no one.I attempt to distract myself from this cruel reality but I have ran out of entertaining things to distract me. No one cares about me, I feel like a background character, I want to kill myself",1
"I am not trying to be dramatic or anything but I honestly just hate life and want to die very badly. Living is constant mental pain and i hate it. I have also come to realization that life is pointless and it has no meaning, even if life did have meaning I still would not enjoy it. In my case suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem because my problem is that I hate life and that is never going to change so, suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem for me. Suicide is the only thing that will fix my problem and give me peace. I honestly do not want to live anymore. 16M",1
"I just binged while trying to restrict and then I triggered myself with looking at my ex's profile and I am such a fucking mess. I do not want to go on. I have no one to talk to right now.

"For the past 2 months, I have eaten 200 calories a day and I have not lost any weight at all. My ultimate goal weight is to look like the average 22 year old British woman. The majority of women in their early 20's are slim and eat a lot.I am a UK size 30. The average 22 year old woman in the UK is a size 8 and eats no less than 3000 calories a day. I count calories and I measure my food and for the past 2 months I have eaten less than 200 a day.I have tried everything to lose weight and I no longer want to be alive.

At first the withdrawals were AWFUL but i soldiered on but its been a month and a half now and I am starting to have hallucinations. Mainly at night. Dark corners/hallways and windows ect. When it happens I just tell myself its not real. Has anybody else experienced this? It seems so late to be experiencing the worst parts of the withdrawals. Tempted to get back on it. Not sure if its a side affect of getting off it or I am just going crazy now that the medication is out my system *nervous laughter* I have an appointment with my doctor for Monday. Just thought a second opinion will not hurt. Preferably someone that is experienced the same thing. Hallucinations from getting off 30mg mirtazipine,0
"Solitude, The state of being alone. The last few months I have experienced solitude. I lay in my room 24/7 and the only time I go out in to the world is to practice with my bands. I have a mix of emotions about the way I interact with people. Sometimes I can meet new people and not be scared, nervous or afraid. But most of the time I am to much of a coward to go out and meet new people. Which probably explains why I have been single my whole life. Though I am just 17 I frequently have suicidal thoughts. I used to act on those thoughts and hurt myself bad. Sure back when I was 13 I went through an emo phase and hurt myself for attention. But this is different. Nowadays I really want to die and sometimes I always pick a date to end myself but I am not going to because I would hurt lots of people who care for me. I love everyone too much to end myself sorry if this was concerning I just really needed to get this off my chest. My experience with being lonely",0

"I am so hopeless, I feel like a robot who is been turned onto autopilot. I just want everything to stop, and to finally be at peace. I know I need help but I cannot even go get it or even kill myself because I have people who rely on me. My friend is falling apart and I have to help her escape an abusive relationship. Obviously I love her and I want to help but Its just such shitty timing because I need help too. I also had an awakening at how much my brother is drinking and how awful he is doing as well. I wish I could just help the people I love instead of being just a presence doing the tiny bit they still can. I love them both so much and everything is such a mess. I want to help them and do not mind doing it but I do not know how long until ill have nothing left. I feel so trapped and I do not know if ill ever escape, I just want to sink into nothing. I cannot break",1
"i have been depressed for most of my life, and my parents thought they finally got rid of it. i have been on antidepressants for like 2 years and it seemed to help. but now i have been letting the metaphorical shit hit my fan so everything has gone back to square one. I am afraid that if my mom finds out, she will feel bad for me and will be really upset and i do not want that to happen. i cannot even cry or express my feelings cuz the last time i get really upset i said id burn the house down and now my dad thinks I am a pyromaniac so fuck my life. :/but lol actually the real reason (i do not care about anyone but myself) is because she may put me in the mental hospital that they put me in last time i was suicidal.but that place is no ""hospital""they make you explain what heinous act you committed to get here every 10 minutes, and not only is it triggering to hear that other people in the room hurt themselves, but that it forces me to strategize my responce to their questions, like instead of ""i threatened to smack my head against the wall and to kill myself"" i slowly change my respawnse to ""i am just really sad all the time""i hate that when my dad yells, i just have to force myself to not cry and feel all this pain in my chest instead. i hate the fact that i have to hide my depression from my parents",0
"Its been very hard for many years that I felt I am happy, every moment that I suppose to feel happy, my anxiety and pressures tell me that I am not allowed. I have been ruined a lot of things, wasted a lot of times and chances, I feel like I am in debt to my life. There are too many things I need to but have not been done. They are piled up high. By only thinking this, I cannot be happy, I feel guilty to be happy for only some seconds. I just want to be happy (for a little while)",0

"i risked too much, and now i feel I am losing it all. the thing is, I did not have much to gamble with in the first place and it took everything I had to be strong enough to keep moving forward. I have been trying to get this engineering major finished since I was 26, now I am 30. it is going to still take another year and a half. it is not that I am not smart enough. it is that I have extremely debilitating undiagnosed issues that because me to self destruct and self harm. my level of self hatred is not negligible. people have seen it in me for years. men have told me things like that I have a chip on my shoulder, they ask me why I am doing what I am doing, they use me repeatedly because I have no defense. it is a curse being intelligent at the bottom, especially for a woman. it is almost too painful to describe. and the fact is that I take pains not to blame others and to shoulder burdens on my own. and it is never enough, it is never good enough. I am used up and ruined. the only time things were going well for me, someone greedy and evil saw my happiness and my earnestness and they pounced on me. tricked me, used me up. hurt me beyond measure. and i feel that I am screaming inside but no one seems to care. it is past the point of being too proud to ask for help, it is just that it seems I am asking too late. the efforts I make now seem to be tainted and cursed. having high expectations of myself translates into high expectations of others and when you are down down down in a bad place financially, mentally as a woman believe me the amount of people who judge and mistrust your character is much higher than those willing to be sympathetic or to do anything to help.I make the issue worse by watching misogynist propaganda i find online. I play into that mindset that I am just a dirty slut that deserves to get thrown away, because it hurts so badly to not understand why my life has been so cruel. it almost is a relief to just feel the abuse, feel that i deserve it now because it keeps finding me. what a cursed existence. all because i wanted more from life, and I truly believed that i had been short changed and that if I worked hard enough that things could get better for me. unfortunately for someone that has the label independent woman, it is pretty unappealing in all reality where i am at geographically. not terrible, no one stops me. but people are suspicious. and men seem to just have a sixth sense that my passionate spirit and easy to excite personality and my openness are just ripe to abuse and take advantage of. I have to move in 3 days, i have nowhere lined up. i broke my foot recently and i also got charges for smoking marijuana recently. i had to take medicaid so that i could get some kind of medical care, and i hate myself for what I have become and where I am at now. To me, I am a victim of circumstance and of ignorance (my own). yet no one cares about the particulars when you are down like I am, they just see someone emotionally out of control and our society, the world in general, treats women so disposably. I am extremely aware of my own disposability and the thrill or excitement or hope that allowed me to keep functioning in the past have been taken from me. &amp;#x200B;honestly, I am too overwhelmed to function and too stubborn to give up. I have never felt more misunderstood or more unattractive. I have thoughts of ending my life daily but i lie to the therapist about that because i do not want to end up in some lockdown or for it to be any more obvious how fucking insane I have gone from all of the despair. I feel strongly that at this point, because of my lifelong self destruction, that the only person who would really feel upset would be my mother. and even she is more than aware of the neglect and abuse in my past so even she would probably have to acknowledge that the act has given me some sort of relief. Although she is so religious , maybe she would hate me for it. but it cannot be much worse than having to support your daughter who was ruined mentally by an abusive man and who has such misguided lofty aspirations when in reality, I am nothing more than a used up slut who is too old for a man to love. i know how skewed my perceptions are, it did not matter when i was functional, but now I am not. i do not want to face the consequences of the past . i want to give up because all of my idealism and hope are dead. and I am not even attractive or youthful or anything useful to a man anymore. yes I have got issues bad. i feel so worthless. i feel so hopeless. I am drawn to people that abuse me. I am a burden to the state and to my mother financially. I am not sexually driven or beautiful so i'have no worth to men. I have existed in misery without help for so long that nothing gives me happiness anymore and i attack those that try to help me because I have been hurt so many times. i want to gather all of my belongings, leave this place, leave my stuff with my mom and just drive away and find somewhere beautiful to end my life, alone and solitary and without anyone else around to hurt me. only myself just let me crawl away and die",1
"When I tried to kill myself I ended up in the hospital and it seemed like nobody cared, except my parents that were angry on me and later a little violent... Psychiatrist just told my mom that they would have never done such thing to their own mother. Later when I spoke to some people (like psychiatrists or other), they never seemed to be interested in helping me and most of them thought (i guess) that my problems were not that bad. I have never gone often to therapy and thought that most of them just found me uninteresting but is not it still their job to help me? . I had this problem in the past too and then developed a way of thinking: ""Nobody really cares and they maybe want me dead but I am also boring them"" This was when I was 13-15, now I am 18.... Anyway, this really hurt me and please__Can someone tell me how to cope with this?__ _Also there was one person that understood my pain and since then I have been obsessing over them, what do I do? __ _Please can someone help so that I do not lose hope completely, I could not find anyone's help other than here_ :'(( What to do when other people invalidate your problems?

"I have honestly had enough. everything is worth what? nothing.people have told me for years ""it gets better, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" is it though? when does it get better? 18 fucking years is pretty long term to me. Nothing temporary here. when does it end then? What the fuck have you been through to be able to say that in confidence to me? It ends when I do. this is the permanent solution to a permanent problem. Why should I have to suffer and live this punishment, when the people I stayed for are thriving and i have to sit and watch them? feeling numb and constantly thinking why was not I the one who was able to live like that? my ex boyfriend dead, my mam and dad non existent, siblings want nothing to do with me, friends have just left. i just want to end it all.

Admitting to yourself that you have been doing the wrong things is painful. And right now I am going through that phase. This pain makes me just want to lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.

"Every other day I feel like everyone is problems would be solved if I did not exist. I have been hearing voices for about six months now, and overtime the ones that use to be comforting when I was anxious have started telling me that everyone around me is lying to me about everything and my family is the only safe group of people. But even now they are telling me that my family would be safer if I was not around, my dad just quit his job and I have a distinct feeling that by me existing near them I am endangering them in some way. I am on medication as of the last couple days, but I have been going in this circle for months now. I feel okay for a few hours, slowly get worse, and by the next day I am one weird look from a stranger away from ending everything. I cannot do this anymore. I am exhausted. I do not even know why I bother to keep fighting the urge to leave. The feeling just comes back and it comes back a little worse everytime. Music has been helping. But now I can hear songs playing over eachother when I try to listen for too long. Everything is crumbling around me. I feel like I am melting into my surroundings. What do I do. cannot keep going in circles anymore",1
Last night I could not sleep ... the moment I laied down on my bed I felt my wrist aching it is like a blade was running over my inner wrist I do not know if it make any sense but I have never done self harm but still somehow I could feel the blade running over my wrist (I considered self harm but never act on it)I am not depressed.. I do not think I have depression and it is strange that I am on my summer holiday so I cannot see what is the stressor? I am afraid because I have been imagining cutting my wrist and bleed slowly to death but this is new to me the feeling on my wrist Help me... please I feel aching in my wrist,1
"I have been getting depressed lately due to some issues with work. If you have ever read about administrative burdens increasing physician burnout during COVID times, it is exactly that. I feel like this is a situation where therapy will not help because it does not change the fact that I have been getting screwed by policy changes and other things I have no control over. I will not get into more about the situation here because it is a long, complex, and specific situation. I have tried everything I can to resolve the issue and manage my own attitudes but I know deep down that until the issue that is contributing to my depression is resolved, I will not feel better.I have kind of hinted at my state of mind to several people and they did not seem to pick up on it, but then one guy did and said I need to get help. Is therapy really going to do anything when the underlying because is still there and I think I am already managing the things I do have control over (including my stress levels and the depression) as well as I possibly can? Are there situations where therapy will not help?",0
"I have been in down for a few weeks now, its less intense after the third week, kind of like I am in a light fog so I am guessing my depression is easing off a little until next time comes around again.Well, today I was staring at my ceiling just existing when my dog suddenly jumped up my bed. I looked down and she positioned herself at my side, then she leaned her head against the side of my chest and just squinted her little eyes at me. Something burst and I was suddenly overwhelmed with emotions, I was crying before I knew it and I just petted her and softly told her how much I loved her.The first few weeks of my depression resurgence was full of me planning my own suicide because I could not take the feeling and knowing it will just repeat again, but my little dog, seeing her lean her head and just look at me without expecting anything, trusting Ill still be around to care for her, it just snapped for me who Id be leaving behind. I love her too much, she is seen the worst of my episodes but she still leans her little head against me and looks at me like I mean something. At the very least, I have her, and Ill be around for her until she goes. My dog made me cry today",0

At the same time I should not have these thoughts because I have wonderful friends and a boyfriend I love and want to marry but I feel like there is always something missing. I stress about a lot of things, like I doubt I will get a job anytime soon so I will never be able to buy a nice house with a beautiful garden that I dream of having. And my boyfriend and I will probably have to break up because he really want kids and I do not, so there is no compromising there. But I feel like he is my perfect match and I will never love anyone else again.

He said its okay lay it on me, and I said no, because you always get frustrated not being able to help or you get sad. He said no its okay talk to me. So I did, and I told him why I feel like it does not make sense for me to keep living and how much I hate this world. He takes it personally and gets sad because ""i do not even want to be here with him"". I told him this is exactly why I said I do not want to do this. Hes upset now and says its all his fault because he said it was okay for me to vent to him.

"So I posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if I was gone for a long period without talking (2 weeks since I am quite active there) that I was probably dead. The reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support. And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking, that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me (maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close) and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them.

"I would have liked to consider myself as someone who recovered - like someone battling cancer or other similar diseases. Like its been 6 years now, can I say that I do not have major depressive disorder anymore? what is damning about mental health is that its closer to an ongoing process - closer to what you might see in recovering addicts. I am having my first major relapse (depressive period) in almost 6 years. My initial depression was something I did not recognize- something I was not consciously aware of. Honestly, I did not know of another way of thinking that long ago, and thought my life would always be like this, Id always feel like this.. its a miracle I lived as long as I have. With the help of a counselor who was able to change my perspective, a psychiatrist and developing a support system, I was able to overcome the lowest of my depression and finally feel. normal?Now, I know what both feels like. What is normal and what is abnormal. I have had some small bumps and up and downs throughout time, but nothing major. I was always self aware enough of what negative patterns start to lead me to a downward spiral. I have maintained medication and self-care habits to keep me from the edge. Right now, I am in a major depressive episode. I do not know what happened. All of the sudden I was thinking of killing myself again. It first started actively thinking of ways to off myself. I could not think of anything else. Then, those thoughts started to think in the background. I was grocery shopping, looking at fruits and trying to think if I wanted an apple, then I was hoping that something would happen and kill me there. Its this weird disconnect where I feel so self aware of these thoughts unlike before. Like I know I am moving slowly. I have to think about the next step on refilling water than just doing the entire process fluidly (open lid, think next step, ok put lid on side, ok what is next, ). When I sit and stare at a blank wall, part of me wants to laugh because I know what is happening, but I cannot stop. I am still self aware mentally, but my body cannot take the action to start moving. I know its the symptoms of my depression, and I want to laugh everytime I notice it, because, hey its there and I know it is, but it will not go away and its making me do weird things like staring at blank walls for 12 hours. Another thing I have noticed is when I talk to other people, its not a seamless experience of reacting to emotions and providing non-verbal cues with verbal responses. I am taking in the information, putting everything I have into listening, then I have to think about what you said then decide how I should act. Like I am thinking about whether to frown or how to show concern on my face, then I can finally maybe think of something to say. Its like this very unnatural experience to try and stay normal. Sleeping regularly is something that I used to take pride in. Now I cannot sleep until the sun rises, but then to try and correct my sleep, Ill wake up 3 hours later. Ill feel so tired (both physically and mentally) until about 10pm, when I finally feel ready to accomplish a (small) task. From 9am-10pm, I spend my time trying to gather some form of strength to move, to accomplish something, to do dishes or laundry or really, anything. Now that I am not a teen or young adult anymore, and as someone who now has a career and a job where other people need me, well, its not going good to say the least. there is no real end to this because there is no end, and I am currently suffering from an depressive episode. I feel close to a crisis but also feel too aware and cannot just let things be like this. I guess to end this, would be some advice or help? I am in so deep that doing simple things take 10 hours before I can do it. I try to think of things I used to enjoy doing, but cannot even fathom any enjoyment in them- I.e., hiking- right now, its just a lot of effort to look at some effing shrubs and trees. What were the small things you have done to pull yourself out? Thinking of taking medical leave and seeing my psychiatrist seem like an impossibility daunting task right now. Relapse ramble &amp; support?",0

I just wanted to say that life is a beautiful thing and I hate some people are missing it. From my own experience, pain is part of life. Suffering is optional. A lot starts with forgiveness. Of ourselves first and then others. In the end, we will never live while we are trying to die. we have got nothing more to lose sometimes so we grab life again and again and we do our best. We cannot worry about the rest. Somebody out there needs you. That was something its taken 40 years to understand. Seize the day. We do not know what we have got till its gone. In the end",1

"Why is it so fucking difficult to get a job, I have tried for years and I still have no experience. I have been rejected in 3 interviews in this one week alone. What the actual fuck. I am getting sick and tired of this shit. My nonexistent confidence was shattered a long time ago because my stupid fucking ass cannot do a simple task like getting a job. My self-hatred is aggravated by the fact I cannot get a job and I spend most of the day absolutely miserable and wishing I would just not exist. I feel even worse because I paid 7k for a useless certificate that was supposed to help me! Not only that but I have a mark of distinction too! What am I doing wrong? The more I get rejected the more bitter I get. I feel fucking useless.The only thing that gets me through the day is my long distance girlfriend but she is not always around to talk and I do not want to bother her with my problems. She already knows how absolutely pathetic I am.I guess I am not really asking for help or anything, I just am very upset right now and want to know that someone knows how I feel right now.

Every job I apply for I get rejected, I try incredibly hard at school and get mediocre grades. I worked my ass off, even having a psychotic break, to finish graduate school and gained literally nothing but debt. I got a professional certification in data analytics and cannot get a single interview. I met a girl I adore and her best friend goes out of his way to turn everyone against me.

"28 male here. This is something I never felt comfortable about talking to anyone about it in person as I do get emotional about it too much. I have had suicidal thoughts over the years, never brought myself to go through with it but they still linger in the back of my mind. First time was when I was in year 10 at school. All through my young life I was bullied physically and verbally. By that point I just felt completely shit about myself, felt that I had no friends, did not deserve any friends and did not deserve to live anymore. Ended up writing a letter stating how I was feeling and passed it onto one of the guys in my class. Later on that day I was on the top floor of the school walking towards the balcony area under the skylight. My intention was to climb over the barrier, jump from what would have been in effect 6 stories up and aim for the metal plate on the bottom floor.I never got there as my English Teacher called me into her classroom for a chat. Turned out she had been informed about the letter I wrote and she gave me one big pep talk which helped me to feel a bit better about myself and snap back to reality. She never knew that she had just stopped me from jumping.A few years later after I turned 19, I went into the Army. Started developing problems with my knees during basic but managed to complete it. Got to trade training and was really struggling due to my knee problems along with other things. Eventually it got to the point when each time I walked into the accomodation block and looked up to the top floor balcony, I just kept imagining myself hanging from the balcony with paracord around my neck.The knee problems continued and after a few months, I was told that I was going to be recommended for a medical discharge by the doctor. I was completely devastated by this as it was the first job I ever had and I was now going to lose it. I broke down in the medical centre and had to get picked up by one of the training staff from the camp who did provide some comfort. Later on I smuggled a large bottle of Jack Daniels into my room (no alcohol allowed in the block btw) and my intention was to down the whole thing in an attempt to kill myself that way. Again, never went through with and ended up sharing it with some of the lads when we had a trip to the beach.Left the Army in 2014 and since then, I have had a logistics job, done an apprenticeship in Fabrication and Welding and now employed as a semi-skilled fabricator. So been working on myself a lot other the years. But every so often, I have felt crap about myself and hating myself for my past decisions. And on those occasions, a voice pops into myself telling me ""why carry on? Just grab the length of rope you got in the car, go into the woods round the back of your house and just go hang yourself!"" But, there is another voice, a feminine one telling me ""no do not that. you are still doing alright. Just keep going"" and that one always wins.I have no desire to end myself as I know I have still got plenty of opportunities and time to sort myself out and better myself. But I just keep getting haunted by these dark thoughts on occasions and they bring me to tears every time. But somehow I have been able to just stuck it up, dust myself off and soldier on day by day. Dark thoughts from long ago haunt me",0
"i honestly wish i was never born I did not give consent to be brought into this shit world but now that I am in it I have to live through it funny how I cannot even leave ,, i wonder what is the easiest and painless method to kill myself pill overdose ? it could be a test if the universe actually wants me to live or not i wish I had a gun I could have ended it so easily maybe jumping ? I am scared Ill fail and then Ill end up with some kind of condition that will scar me for the rest of my life I am too scared though its weird because I think its selfish that my parents birthed me for their own desire but then again they wanted a smart perfect baby not a suicidal dumb scared little kid so I guess I feel bad for them I mean they did not do much wrong and do not deserve that kind of pain for the rest of their lives maybe I should try ? who am I kidding I cannot do anything you know I think I only have one life might as well try because you never know what happens I mean we do not even matter in the universe we are just a speck of dust but at the same time its just so I do not know anymore i wished i killed my self back in 2018",1

"So I am in my 30s CPTSD pretty much every single symptom of thatChildhood neglect childhood abuse be molested as a kid and they grew up to be raped and physically abused and drugged I have been beat up by a boyfriend all that crap.So here I am I told my mom last week that I am not going to make it to the end of the year. I am not getting the proper help I can only see counsellor once a week and her advice for that was to find a psychologist that she would pay for once a month..... Last time I was in the hospital they said my CPTSD is critical and I need like the life saving help.So last week told my mom I need something more something impatient something where I can actually heal if you forgive me the right treatment. Her advice was basically stopped being a little bitch and just go back to the 24-hour hold.Then I called her 30 days ago and said I cannot fucking do this I am going to kill myself and I do not want to but I need like intense intervention right now or I am going to lose my fight.Her response was I do not know what to do but should I call the police on you......Now 2 days after which is now today, she calls me and leaves a voicemail cuz I was on the phone with two other lines already like one was I was on hold and the other one was actively like having a conversation. She send s this sulky guilt trippy fake I care about you I really need to know how you are doing' So I actually tried to call back because there is not maybe she wanted to finally help me. 6 hours later she finally picks up and says you know I have friends and people and places to be You do not need to be calling me all the time. And I said yeah like always there is always something before me. And then I told her I figured out the trip that she takes quite often is hours shorter than a drive to me..... So why have not you showed up.She says I do not have an answer I cannot talk to you right now you are always being an hassle and hung upSo in case I was not feeling it desperate as soon as I am before......

"I have always had the thought of killing myself. Ever since I would have to say 5th grade. But as they say, when those thoughts coming into your mind at such a young age they are not serious. I think this is what started my suicidal thoughts though. Having them brought into my mind at such a young age and then not being properly analyzed. It was more of a brush it off thing. So now I sit here at just 25 years of old recently.. things may have gotten better slightly before high school ended. Then as soon as it was over.. the downhill spiral seemed to accelerate x15. Right now I would not mind me passing at literally any given moment. From where I sit I do not see any possible way to create an incline for myself. A little more background is I used to be a drug addict. I worked the clinic program instead of the 12 steps because personally I find some of the steps total horseshit (not all). But with that being said as of the past month Id say I was at the last third of my treatment. And I got to do what I always do Fuck it up. I used and I hate myself so much more now. There was no point in going on the stupid 2 week bender that I did but now that I did it. I have backtracked myself 8 months. Do you know how devastating that is. To me Its almost enough to just say fuck it because to have that possibly happen again I would be wasting my own lifealong with the others who genuinely tried to help me along the way.

But at the same time, I wish god would come down from the sky for one second and just tell me, hey, its okay. You can do this. But he will not because that is not what he thinks. I have no choice except to keep living as a woman. And Id rather kill myself.I have a plan to cut myself enough that I bleed to death tomorrow.

"TLDR: Wean off effexor xr 75mg myself or cold turkey?I have been on paxil/effexor xr 75mg for a couple of years now. I feel like its done its job. I am no longer depressed for months at a time. Just some bad days that are few and far between. I have a job that I like for the most part (retail). I am just sorta neutral on everything. I do not have super lows or super highs just blah. I feel like that its not giving anymore benefits. Just major headaches if i miss a dose. For the past year since before COVID started to wonder trying to see how life is without it since I have changed/ the worlds changed so much since I started taking it.I really dislike my current doctor, I only go to him since he is the same doc as my dad and that he is close. Today I called him to see if I can try stopping. He did not suggest it since he said that it could take 6 weeks to see any effects. And that trying to go back on it if I decide I need it is bad.I asked if he was going to wean me off or just make me quit cold turkey. He said that I should just stop cold turkey. Now I know that when I miss a dose or two I get bad headaches/brain zaps, become really irritable, and get sick. So him saying cold turkey is fine makes me feel really scared. I have read up on other peoples posts that effexor xr is the worst to stop cold.I was wondering if I could either A) break the few pills I have left and self wean or B) try to find another doctor as a new primary care physician/ second opinion.Any advice is greatly apricated.

"Hello. I have read alot of people on here(suicide and depression groups) who actually encourage suicide and that is never okay. I am not wanting people who can relate to these feelings but rather hoping someone who is online is an advocate or something who can give me hope. I am in a very bad/dark mindset and I am contemplating suicide. I have been for over a month but tonight I am truly having the mindset to go forth. I have a legit(to **ME**) reason as to why I am contemplating. I do not want to go into details on here as I got hate earlier for reaching out with my reasoning. I was told I was pathetic and ridiculous for wanting to end my life over said reason and was told to get over it and move on when I strictly asked for that not to do be mentioned.The suicide hotline is not cutting it... it makes me uncomfortable. I want to be able to talk about my issues but I cannot as I have no one. The one person I did have.... is gone and now I am like this... Alone and contemplating ending it all.(get help seek a doctor seek meds move on get over it quit relying on someone else for happiness time heals etc) are all things I do not need to hear. They make matters worse. they are cliche and there is a reason why therapists avoid using those.One, I am seeking help on here. Two, I reached out to a new therapist. Three, I do not like meds. Four, I cannot move on or get over my situation. Five, I do not rely on someone else for happiness they just so happened to be the only shred of happiness I had in life. Six, time does not heal. Sometimes time will because things to fade to a certain extent... but it is not that way for EVERYONE. If time healed and people got over everything(cliche) this group would not exist. Suicide would not exist. So to be as short as I can. I am going through the biggest/worst event of my life. I am alone. I am sad. I am heartbroken. I have no one and I mean that. Family told me to ""either kill yourself or shut the hell up I am tired of hearing crying and about you being sad."" I do not get out of my house much. I am an introvert with super bad IBS who is scared of everything... literally. So no I do not have any friends. I *had* one true person in life. Anyways, I have gone through death. Watched some of the closest people to me die awful death's. The worst being a death brought on by cancer. Watched her deteriorate after the diagnosis-radiation and chemo, and within a year of diagnosis she died in hospice. Last moments with her she was not there. She was so doped up on pain meds she could not talk and did not know who we were. And STILL this pain I am facing now as awful as that sounds.... does not even begin to amount to this pain I am feeling now. I am wanting to end my life. I can end my life so easily right now but a small piece of me wants to hang on or I would not be on here. Sure it is sad and pathetic I am on here for help but it is HERE FOR A REASON because some people still care about others in life even if it is strangers. Is there a safe video chat or some kind of chat(not suicide hotline-convos too short) that does not have a time limit? If not, I just need hope. I need to hear that there is always hope. I know you do not know what my situation is or why I am asking for hope, but if it is true, my situation does not matter. There IS hope. I need just a small amount. Just a tad so I can NOT go over the edge. I want to talk about why I am feeling this way SO BAD but I know I will get hate... even if it is one person out of 10 or so. Someone is going to give me hate and make me feel more like shit or they are going to say the one thing's I have said I cannot bare to hear anymore. Please... anyone? Hope. I am alone and broken... Is there anyone who is an advocate online? Actively feeling suicidal",1
"I am having suicidal thoughts lately just because of my health issues.It all started in 2018 initially, I was all heathy and good but all of a sudden I developed frequent urination, along with that kicked in my health anxiety. It took my some months but finally I got over it! For a year it was all good, then I got acidity issue then later on I developed tinnitus which was the most devastating phase in my life. I lost my girl, whom i loved more than anything because of this, I cut out myself from social areas. For an year you can say entire 2020 went in recovering from that, finally when I was feeling better and started moving on, bamm, another issue popped up, i had allergies.Then while dealing with that at some point i got severe upper respiratory infection because of which again meds!Now after that, i took the vaccine, now i see I have pigmentation in my buccal mucosa, all the dentists are saying its normal but dermatologists stated its oral lichen planus! Idk what to do, all these diseases which are non-curable re coming to me! What is my fault, why m i having to suffer all these?Now I am scared of cancer and this gives me heath anxiety most of the time! I really feel so hopeless, i feel like my body is not supporting me. I am scared, angry, frustrated and what not!This is why suicidal thoughts came into my mind! Idk what to do.Doctors are not helping much in accurate diagnosis, i feel like i am in a loop of experiencing bad events!:( I need help!",1
My sister is a recovering addict who has been in recovery for almost two years. she is feeling very stressed and anxious just overwhelmed by life and she told me that she is worried about relapse and suicide. But she gets overwhelmed when I try to talk to her about how I can help to alleviate some of the stress in her life. I have done things like clean her house to make sure that she has a peaceful space and does not have to worry about that. I got her doctors contact information but I need her insurance card to call and make her an appointment. I have asked for it a couple times and each time she was overwhelmed already and just asked me not to do it right then. I cannot ask too much or push too hard or she gets overwhelmed and freaks out. I am at her house with my two children and I worry that the children are too much stimulation for her but she has a one year old and I want to be here to help care for her. I also am afraid to leave her alone. I am afraid to do anything actually. I am afraid if I do not talk and I just try to keep the kids away from her to give her quiet that she will think I am upset. I am afraid if I try to talk about what she is going through she will be overwhelmed. I am afraid if I talk about other things to provide a distraction or show her I am not upset that she will think I do not care or be overwhelmed. Help. I have no idea what to do. do not know what to do,1
"Idk what to do at this point. I am constantly feeling like a failure in life &amp; no matter how much i try to change it i always feel like people are looking at me as a failure or as if I am not enough, I have recently started cutting myself again and at this point I am not sure even if its worth being alive at this point with the feeling of everyone looking down on or everyone blaming me for something going wrong.. am i just that much of a shitty person? I cannot even fix myself because i still feel like ill never be enough. I am starting yo hate myself more no matter how much i try to correct things i do wrong in life or try to fix shitty situations in my life i feel like i cannot ever do shit right and everyone is looking down on me for it I am currently a botlle and a hlf in thinkjng blut where i should just end myself I have been thinkingnof it so long and i feel like that would make every situation better &amp; everyone around me less bothered &amp; annoyed At wits end",1

"i was doing very well for some time now. probably since early spring. no clue what set me off. i have not been enjoying my new job much, but that is not a new feeling (took the job in january). i woke up tired today. as the day went on, my ability to focus on work and maintain my motivation to get through the work day quickly deteriorated. by dinner, i had no plans of eating (managed a protein bar at lunch). this is not usual - normally i am hungry and, when depressed, i binge eat often. but my boyfriend decided to cook the meal i was meant to make us, so i did eat a healthy dinner. i then laid down in my made bed. i did not get up again. i have things to do around the house, but i cannot be bothered. they do not matter to me in the moment, but, at the same time, they do. i have anxiety about wasting time just laying here. but i cannot find a good reason to actually get up. about an hour ago, i started crying. i feel heavy and like there is low-grade electricity in my skin. i am uncomfortable. i have no idea why i feel sad.but i do know that my boyfriend otherwise ignoring me all night after dinner did not help. sure, he made the food (though he also had to eat), but then he never checked on me. he got mad that i asked him (for what was probably the millionth time in the last 6 years) not to touch my stomach when he came in to say goodnight just before he went to bed. i do not like my stomach touched and i have been explicitly clear about this to him relentlessly; he just does not care about my boundaries. because i called him out via asking him once again not to do the thing he was doing, he curtly said goodnight and left without giving me a kiss as he usually would have done. that was my punishment, i guess. he very often withholds various forms of affection and this is usual behavior for him. so, i am not surprised. and i was not surprised he never checked on me because he is also very selfish and self-centered (likely a narcissist). but i am not here to talk about him and his many problems or how these impact me. while his behavior and the way he treats me has done absolutely nothing to improve my overall mental health, i was depressed long before him and I am sure i will be long after. i was not expecting him to help today or do anything really, but brought it up because i wanted to mention still that i am nevertheless feeling disappointed that the person i care about did not give me the care that i have in the past and would have given him if our positions were reversed today. i knew he would not, but it still sucks that he did not. either way, i was already sad and do not know why. this just did not help the situation.background: depression has been a problem for most of life over the last 20 years on and off. in min my mid-30s now. its better and then its not. i can go long stretches of almost months and be completely fine; feeling cured.and then something will set me off again into a downward spiral. usually quite slowly, so i do not see it coming. but I am getting better at identifying when the symptoms are starting to onset and i can start to employ my various countermeasures. but sometimes, often really, it is tough to identify what triggers it to come back. when my depression is bad, i am insatiably hungry, tired, unfocused, unmotivated, sad (crying on and off), experience loss of interest in friends/hobbies/fun, have loss of sex drive, and i cannot sleep. this is sometimes accompanied by anxiety attacks and a one-time panic attack. anxiety is new to the party in the last 2-3 years. and its not nearly as much of an issue, but its there at times. sometimes with the depression and sometimes on its own. fortunately, i am able to force myself to work so that it has never really impacted my career. but i cannot do much else when in a depressive episode. which can last for days to months (though its been awhile since its been more than a few weeks). i live with my boyfriend, whom i love despite his narcissism (he is not all bad, i swear. he just has a lot of his own problems and has no problem putting himself first and/or being selfish). hes almost 40 and we have lived together almost 6 years and it is manageable for now as i cannot afford any other option anyway. he might not be helping my depression but he is not purposely making it worse. and that is a lot better than the last several guys. my US employer-supplied health insurance does not cover therapy and i cannot afford therapy out-of-pocket (i have researched this extensively). lethargic, low-grade anxiety, sad for no reason.",0

"""I do not feel so good"", I said to my mother, she was talking to other people on the party and did not listen. ""can you please ask someone for some medication?"" Again, no response. I felt terrible and walked around fo a bit. I thought that the pain might just go away with time, It did not. I might had been able to ignore it but it got worse. It got so bad to the point where I actually wanted to leave the party. Thanks God I met one of my friends they talked with me and cheered me up. The pain is still there but it is not as strong anymore. And even tho I still want to go I think I am going to stay here for a while.This is something I am actually quiet proud of and I think this is a good reference to depression. :) This is how depression feels for me.",0

"For more than a year now, I have been waking up feeling like shit. Most of times there no apparent reason , it has become kind of a morning ritual. My head pounds, I feel extreme sadness, and I really struggle to go about my daily chores. The situation improves as the day progresses and by mid day/noon I am able to do my job without much problem.But, recently the morning depression has been getting worse accompanied by vivid dreaming every night. Now, when I wake up I am more depressed than ever , sometimes I think why did I stop dremaing, why I had to wake up, and I will not lie some bad thoughts have crossed my mind recently. Feeling really helpless now, what should I do? Waking up everyday in the morning seems like literal torture, with my head pounding and a mood so bad it makes me wonder, is it worth living?",0
"Recently I have been having obsessive thoughts about my intelligence and abilitied or lack thereof and I cannot shake them.I have just been offered a dream job but my self-confidence has plummeted as I have been preparing for it. I know the stress of preparing for it has definitely kicked off a lot of feelings of being insecure in my abilities but I think it goes deeper than that. I just get stuck in these thinking ruts and my mind becomes completely cloudy - I have talked through some of these feelings before and it seems like when I have a problem I start either putting up invisible barriers or I think of all the things that could go wrong and it ends up closing off my mind to solutions before I even get a chance to think anything through. I cannot catch a thought and hold onto it long enough to solve anything - my mind just keeps spinning from problem to problem with no solutions. And I have always had this issue to some degree but I could work through it until several months ago, when I was offered this job. I went from feeling comfortable and relatively confident before, to feeling like I do not measure up to anyone around me. Suddenly I am not talented enough or I am not intelligent enough or I am not creative enough or I am not likeable enough when I am around other people. And I know part of this is my on perception working against me but for some reason I cannot shut it off; it is like the irrational, scared part of my brain is taking over. It makes me feel completely disconnected from the people around me and I end up feeling terrible and not confident about myself. I have read about the concept of a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset; that embodying a growth mindset helps you overcome feeling stuck by believing you can grow as a person whereas a fixed mindset leaves you stuck in a rut. Just rationally, I know I should have a growth mindset to believe that I can grow and change but my emotions are overwhelming my ability to choose that - something in me is constantly telling me that I am stuck being a failure, that I do not deserve good things, and that I have only made it as far as I have due to sheer luck. Does anyone have experience successfully fighting off those feelings? Self-confidence relapse",0

"I have been at home the past year... quite literally not doing anything. And that is the only way I am able to cope with how terrible I feel.

"I am not really sure how to start this... I guess I could preface this by saying that I have no one in my life to turn to for these issues, so here I am. On February 14th of this year, I developed an extremely rare and incurable neurological disorder called Visual Snow Syndrome. For those of you do not know, Visual Snow Syndrome, or VS for short, is a neurological disorder where sufferers see a sort of layer of ""static"" over their entire visual field. Sufferers might also develop other symptoms, like in my case, raging tinnitus. I am definitely not a depressed or anxious person, but I want to end my life; it sounds like an oxymoron, I know. I want to die because I cannot enjoy those little things about life that I love so much, how the sky looks like on a clear day, what silence sounds like. it is driving me nuts and I do not know how much more of this I can take.

"TWI've gone on a very bad downward spiral again recently. I tried to take my own life back in '18, spent some days in the psych ward. Some of you have probably been there, too.Since then, I have not really gotten better - I have just crawled my way into surviving with a strenght I was not sure I had. Two weeks after the attempt I went back to work, and I now realize damn, that is so f\* up. It was like ""now hurry up and be profitable again""I quit that job last year, before the pandemic. Since then, I tried to get another job. I recently landed one which I was really hoping was just going to be something I could handle. Woop-dee-doo. How do I fool myself every time. Two months later, here we are - I collapsed, hard, this time more from my anxiety than from my depression. I just told my boss I was sick until I could figure out what to do. I called my psych; she knows me well. She told me she suggested at least a month off. I know this company would kick me to the curb if I take one month off, so I though it was better to resign saying I got another job offer, patch it up, bye bye.What else can I do other than try my hardest to fix the things this mental illness causes as best as I can? Nothing else.My mom understands. Not everything, because no one who has not had a mental illness can fully understand it. But she is supportive. she is been my anchor all this time. She is the sole reason I am typing today; I would, no doubt, be gone if she were gone. Things is, I moved back here last year, after quitting my job. The reason I moved was because my grandma, who I was living with since 2012, had a stroke and now needs a full-time caregiver. it is a two bedroom apartment, so I had to get out. I guess my stepfather, who ""sees me as daughter"" (pft) has not really liked that. I guess he feels, like always, as if I were here to try and steal my mom or something. I actually felt bad and I thought maybe I am being an obstacle between a couple, even though being honest and kind to myself (quite rare) I have helped the hell out of them after he was diagnosed cancer last year and I took care of the house while they were gone.I think now he just wants me out. I am quite impressed at his lack of care despite being a firsthand witness of my attempt in '18. I asked my mom because I felt something was off (they are gone til tomorrow). She said he, I quote, ""is worried that I will never be able to live on my own.""I do not know if she does but I do see the meaning behind those words. it is a not very subtle ""get out of my house and leave me alone with my wife"". I guess I should have seen it coming, knowing the only love that is unconditional is my mom's. As I wrote down this post I calmed down a little bit. Right now I need to get back on my feet. I will resign from this job because there is no way I can handle it next week, or ever. I will work with my psychiatrist to get me back to ""semi functional"" as I like to call it. Then I am grabbing my money and I am getting the hell out. Screw this. Screw him and his expectations. He can shove his fake care and love up where light does not reach. He has the nerve to judge me, the nerve to expect me to go on after I collapse, when he has two kids (32 and 27) who have NEVER. WORKED.NEVER.I guess I kind of answered myself in this post, but I would still appreciate any input you might have. I feel stronger now. I feel angry. that is good - angry is better than guilty. Eventually I know I will just let go of him, because I do not live with resentment. How am I going to manage once I leave? I have no clue. But I cannot manage here anyway, either. And if I am not wanted, then I shall go.The good side of me still wishes him good. The good side of me cries at how stupid I am, because amidst having a mental breakdown I felt so happy that yesterday he was told his cancer treatment ends next month. I was so genuinely happy, because I do love him. I guess I am just not loved back. And you can tell me ""he loves me in his own way"", but I do not believe in that. You either love someone or you do not. Thank you for the space. I will be down, and up, and down, and up again. But I think eventually, I will just pack up my things and go. And remind myself, yet again, every day, that love is absolutely conditional. How do you deal with the judgement and disappointment of others when they realize you are not who they expected?",0

"Hi, I am just writing this because I want to put it in writing.So, I am a mid 20's straight male who is about to get Master's degree at a university in Europe. For most people that would be considered a real start of life, but for me, it will mark the end. I hope I will leave this world soon after getting my diploma. The reasons are as follows.I have no real friends. I barely hang out with anyone, and even when I do, I always feel like such a burden. Nobody ever invites me anywhere, I always have to initiate something. I have also never had sex, never even kissed a girl, or had a girlfriend. I do not blame them, girls do not like short introverts who have no self confidence. Even though I will finish university, I feel like I am so much dumber than everyone else. I cannot see myself ever getting hired for a job (I have sent applications, and I am always rejected or ignored). Again, I do not blame them either. I have watched all my former class colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable. They all graduated already, have steady jobs, their own houses, girlfriends/boyfriends etc. and I am just here sitting alone writing on SuicideWatch subreddit.The worst part is, I only have myself to blame. Sure, being short, kind of ugly, and being from a poor family did not help, but I have seen people who had it worse than me succeed way better than me. I also have full support from my family in everything I do which is heartbreaking. I would actually prefer if they did not give a damn about me so I could just leave in peace. I have been kind of lazy my whole life, but I would say the bigger problem was that I never had a proper friend/tutor in life. I never had someone I could actually talk about my problems with, or what course in life to do, or to ask help with girl etc. Please do not suggest me psychiatrists, they are incredibly expensive (no way I could afford private ones) and barely do their job where I live, so that is just not an option. So, my current plan is to finish my degree just so my former colleagues do not think that is the reason I left and I look even dumber. After that, I would tell my family I am looking for a job, but I actually will not, and I would just leave one day. I already have a notepad list of things to do (delete everything from phone, web history, stuff like that), put my cash savings in an envelope under my pillow so my family can afford the funeral, and just say I am going to take a walk but I will never come back.that is the plan.

So when my safe haven is shattered, i shatter along with it. I just never learn. I could say that I am used to this by now but i cannot say it does not hurt any less than it did many times over.

Will this actually feel good and just like that all of my problems will go away? If so I am going to punch my ticket soon because I am sick of being on this fucking planet.

"Belief is single handedly the most important thing you can have in this life. Do you remember how as a kid everything felt so much more hopeful and magical so much more exciting. We often times even get nostalgic about these forgotten feelings and we are left with nothing more than a tinge of sadness after. Then you grow up and realize what a cruel and dark place the world can be, that it is not the magical place you thought it was as a kid. That- no we cannot blow a dandelion and wish to fly, that marrying a prince and becoming a princess is not the top thing on our priority list anymore, or that happily ever afters are a nonexistent reality. We realize these things and so we stop believing. We stop believing in most dreams from big ones to small ones and they are replaced instead with anxiety, fear, rejection, low self esteem, and/or depression limiting ourselves from reaching our full potential. We think our dreams are stupid now. That they are a waste of time and non realistic. But would you ever look at your four year old niece who thinks that one day she will build a blue house on a cloud and think wow this kids pretty stupid, obviously clouds are just a collection of liquid droplets which would never be able to hold the weight of a house and even if it was able to, how would you even get up to a cl no. We think this type of imagination is precious and pure, or at least I do. we used to ask why cannot I become____? But the question now becomes what is the point?. We think we are more wiser now, more logistical there is no time for childish dreaming anymore when there is work to be done to earn a living to eat sleep repeat and die. I realized one day however that the world has always been the same broken sad world that it was even when we were kids. Why is it different now? The only thing that changed is us. We stopped believing one day. Believing like a little kid again",0

I mean, yeah, I have ""high standards"", but if I myself live up my standards, why is it wrong for me to want to spend time with someone else who works as hard as I do towards the same standards/values?&amp;#x200B;But I feel like no one will ever accept me because I am a virgin. Because I care about sex-positivity and LGBTetc things and things like that (I am pansexual), but I feel like I would not be seen as legitimate, that I would just be laughed out of the room and trashed because I have never actually been with anyone.&amp;#x200B;Just... having no friends is the same as missing an essential nutrient. You just cannot function. No amount of pushing yourself to get over it is going to make up for that. &amp;#x200B;And I am at my limit.&amp;#x200B;I just want to be seen. I just want to be acknowledged as a person. I want to exist. I want to actually exist. I feel like I do not exist because no one notices me. &amp;#x200B;Just... being 100% ignored... it hurts. I just need friends.&amp;#x200B;If I died today, no one would even know. Like. There literally is not a single person anywhere who would miss me. I am just never going to have any friends or personal connections with other people",0
I have been trying to find a job out of college for a year now but I am shit at interviews no matter how much i practice and i have to hold back all my tics and autistic traits and there is so much competition out there i will never be able to move out but i need to so badlyi want to learn a new skill so id be employable but as I have learned college is one big expensive joke and there is so much competition to find a job that it would be pointless how do people even get their lives started? i feel like i just was not meant to be a part of this world should i end it?,1
"I am positive my addiction to screen time is causing my depression and I have no desire to stop my 16+ hours of daily screen time.I have read what I need to do and tried to get help locally (I hate online therapy) but there is no services for screen addiction locally. I live in a small Canadian city. there is AA and Narcotics Anonymous but nothing for screen addiction.I am not enjoying things I used to. I have read the dopamine levels I get from screen time is so high its difficult to come off that so I can enjoy normal things.I want to enjoy watching my kids play, games night with friends, having a conversation with my husband, going for walks or watching a live show. But if I do those things I just think about being on my screens. And its not like I do anything productive online. I browse Facebook, Reddit, Twitter. Check my email, bank account, play words with friends and Pokmon go. You would think its ridiculous I could spend over 15 hours a day doing stuff like that, but I do.

I have a group of friends that really care for me to the point they force me to go out and play dnd with them every week (probably only thing keeping my at least partially sane) and yet anytime I am feeling down and want so badly to say something to them I cannot.

"there is a plethora of ways I could kill myself at this moment, many of which would be pretty painless. Or at least, I would not be in the right mind to feel the pain if I were to commit.But I cannot do it.Is it fear? Is it that I still want to live? Nothing actually seems particularly wrong with my life, so is it just a phase? Am I trying to be edgy? I do not know. I am not even focusing on what the title of the post says, I just wanted to write something.Also just realized that I might have imposter syndrome, which is fun.I feel like I am just fucking things up for myself despite having everything I need around me. I feel like I do not deserve to contemplate suicide because other people have gone through actual, real pain. I am at a time where I should be finding focus, where I should be giving it my all, but everything I have done up until this point feels pointless and I feel I will never achieve what I want even if I tried now. I hate myself making things so much harder than it needs to be. And I hate myself for not even trying to make it better for myself. Can this even be called being suicidal? I do not know. I might be overreacting. But at the same time I want to die. I do not want to turn 18. But I am turning 18 soon and I do not know if I want to just end it before I have to face becoming an adult or if I should try to survive by then because I know that there is still a chance to improve. This is just a full on rant, no one's going to read this. I want to talk to someone, but I do not know if I can trust them. I am afraid to find out what would happen if people knew that I have these thoughts. Would my friends and family still love me? Would they see me differently? Where do we go when we die? Do we get reborn when we die? If I were to die, would ""I"" ever feel the sensation of having control over body and thought again? Is it worth finding out? Should I try now? Or would it just be endless nothingness forever for me? it is fucking cold. I have a hoodie on, but my body feels like there is chills all over it. I do not know who I am anymore. I spent my whole life buried in textbooks and nothing else and now I am crumbling under the expectation that I have to apply for uni, whether they will even accept me, why I did not do anything in the past few fucking months I had to do something about this worry. I am scared I am going to disappoint everyone, because I know I made them all believe in me. But now I feel like I am going to betray them by either fucking things up for myself or just ending it all. I do not want to sleep, and I do not want to wake up. I do not want to fail, but I just want to end it all. Who decided that life had to be this confusing? Who decided to give me this fucking brain that thinks these thoughts? I am scared to find out if I would actually kill myself before my birthday. it is only a little bit away. I do not want to put that burden on my family. I know that they love me. I love them. I am fortunate enough to have them around when I cry, so I do not know why I am even having these thoughts. I do not deserve to be like this. I wish I spent my time doing at least something else. Maybe then I would have a better idea of what life is about. Of whether or not my worries are even important. Whether I deserve to cry.This was a long rant. I doubt that one can even form a reply to this. I just wish I could pick something and stick to it - either try and give it my all or decide to end it all now. Why is death so attractive yet scary?",1

Going to keep my personal life to myself but how do I break free of drinking every day and sulking in my own shitty pity? I will elaborate if asked. I used to have a great life, then I screwed up. I genuinely want to live a good, honest life but I am always scared of failing ( at work, in relationships, finances ). I am just tired. I do not want enemies, I want to help others but I am frozen with my own doubt. Slowly giving up, scared, anxious, paranoid",0
"that is it that is what my life been likeSometimes I feel so angry I do not understand it, this paralysing anger literally burns me but I cannot do anything about it, I get psychosomatic pains all the time, and then I start crying because I feel unexplainably sad and I begin to cry, but crying does not help anymore, there is no relief I just feel shitty. Sometimes I wish I felt nothing at all. I feel so bad my ears are ringing, and my neck is in constant pain because I am so tense all the time, and then it makes my head hurt. I cannot tell anyone because they cannot do anything anyway, my parens do not know and even if they would, they would just deny it and say something like ""life is hard, walk it off"". I cannot do anything, I want to quit uni and I am afraid I will not make it through another term but the only thing that stops me is the fact that I do not know what else to do, and I do not want to be a barista or a cashier or something. Not because it is not cool, I would just simply not be able to survive it, literally, this shit it just too difficult. I am not suicidal but sometimes I wish I were. It would make just about everybody's life easier. I do not even like doing what I used to like. I do hobbies out of pure habit, like I remember that I liked it once so I might try to get some serotonin now as well but it is just not working anymore. No I cannot go to the doctor because I am broke and because my parents will flip their shit and freak out and start screaming at me because ""cannot you just be normal and stop embarrassing us pls"" there are only three moods - anger, sadness, and apathy",0
"First off; I am not diagnosed, but I feel I might be at the start of what could be a depression. I am tired, have a hard time eating and sleeping, wake up dreading the day to come, easily overwhelmed, no concentration whatsoever. This all started when I ended up in the hospital with Viral Meningitis.But, I love my job, I love my study, I love hanging out with my friends, I practice my hobbies often, I look forward to the future. But the now feels so off. Online self tests all state I might have a depression and I should visit my doctor. But I do not want to die and I love life. Its just so overwhelming. Is this normal? Or am I just overthinking things? Can a person be depressed and not want to die?",0

"I wake up and I am so angry. I drive to work and I am angry the whole work day. I come home do nothing, barely eat, do nothing and struggle to sleep then repeat. On the weekends I get drunk and go to a club or party, sometimes with some freinds. I hate everything about myself. I am always mad or numb I barely cry anymore I just get angry or do not give a shit. I am a highshcool dropout, I work a shitty dead end job, and I do not have any motivation to do anything else. I am terrified of meeting new people because I know they think I am stupid, disgusting or both. I do not know how to do anything remotely social except getting drunk and going to parties or clubs. I have watched everyone around me succeed and move on with they are lives and forget about me. My friends ask how I am doing and I lie and tell them I am fine or getting better, but its not. I cannot stand lying to them and I do not know why I do, but I cannot open up again and I do not know why.I have seen therapists and tried all sorts of medication. But It did not help I go out sometimes to bridges, cliffs, piers rooftops, anything hoping someone comes along and kills me because I cannot do it myself. I can force myself through feeling awful all the time but I cannot force myself to end it. I just want it to end. Please help me I cannot do this anymore",0
"Hi, I always wanted to talk here but never did. I have depression since age of 10, I am 18 years old. I lost a huge amount of my memory power, like if I have dementia, it is the most annoying shit. Because of that, my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot, in school for instance, people know I have autism (asperger) and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me (one big reason why I hate human beings). I also lost all the human fear of death, like, in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me (that is what sh-) with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me, and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it. And he just ran away and hid from me everyday in school. So anyway, that is it, I will go listen to Soundgarden, Joy Division and Misfits all day, like always. Bye Fear of the D(eath)ark.",0

"I am just so tired, been for a while, but I tried at least.. Streaming especially helped me feel I was doing something with my life and having a schedule/stuff to do helped a lot as well.. But after the previous \~week with my friend who visited me I am just done really.. With everything.. Now that he has left I have been binge eating and drinking alcohol to get drunk on a daily basis as well.. Streaming is also gone now, and I doubt anyone cares either.. About streaming or me really.. I am just so weak, have so many issues, I am beaten down over and over and I just cannot handle it anymore. I also seem to have some ""PTSD"" now. Anything that feels like a touch including my own clothes at times, or even seeing guys touch girls makes me flinch or freeze up and feel terrible, and I fear guys even more now than before as well, even hearing guys breathe in a certain way now on dramas or movies I watch makes me feel quite unwell.. does not help I am ugly as usual. Got called sir at the store today even though my friends tell me I am pretty.. Right.. Also does not help people keep staring at me like crazy non-stop. My friend confirmed this, so I know it is not just me imagining things.. My age regression stuff does not help either.. Wish I got carded for my age, but I look probably 30s or 40s.. have not been carded since I was like 15.. lmao.. Myriad of other issues, but bringing them up with nurses, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists does not do anything, or they treat it as if it is a normal thing.. e.g. me mentioning dissociation and I just get applauded for the effort I have done so far based on my own research as usual, sigh.. (I tend to learn a lot on my own whenever I need to help someone, can help someone or face my own issues I need to resolve..) Had to solve a lot of medical issues this way as well, since the entire system here in Denmark has just failed me, or doctors are openly hostile to me because I am a foreigner.. Meds for me also never worked, I tried so many and they all ruined me completely. Only diet and lifestyle ever worked for me in any way, but can be hard to maintain when you fear going outside and when you spiral one day or friends/family make you eat stuff you never eat normally, and then spiral downwards starts.. (I get very easily addicted..)Already been thinking of various methods and where to go or get stuff, even thinking of a suicide note for the past several days.. As much as I want to say I will admit myself like last year (was forced there, though) I will not. It would be extremely traumatic to me (was quite difficult) and make things even worse afterwards.Wish the pain would stop, but it is been lifelong and there is no help because I have been pooped on by so many people growing up, and now I am just broken completely, and things just get more difficult as I get older as well, which does not help.. How long am I supposed to wait.. 50 years to maybe get a tiny bit of longer term happiness..?I keep hoping I can get blackout drunk (almost at least) and end it, but my tummy just refuses to drink that much and I get drunk only.. Wish I had someone who understood me, but they do not exist. They simply do not. Not someone with as many complex issues as me.. They might have a part here or there that they can relate to, but never even half or a majority of it.. Tired &amp; Ruining My Life Further",1

I feel like I am just a complete bother to him and anyone I talk to. Part of me wants to just take out my .380 and just drink till I am not scared. The other part of me wants to pack my truck and let everyone be happy without me. Then a small part of me wants to quit my job and just play Xbox and get drunk all day. I am tired.

Eight years later and here we are, just more damaged and closer to ending it all than ever before but it is still the most painful thing to comprehend. I have held on for 8 years and have done so many things and made various amounts of growth to come back from this but each time I have failed relentlessly.. I am stuck in this awful world stuck in this toxic environment... what kind of job could I get to move out? it is too late anyway... I have been searching for over a year and it is clear I am over.. I saw my eyes and there was absolutely no life in either of them... I cannot even lie anymore, I cannot even fake a happy customer service persona... Dear God knows I have wished for something terminal for years now and each time I hear about someone dying I wish it was me instead and they could live on just longer before their inevitable demise... I have done so much just to suffer more daily... I regret waking up everyday and choosing life.. the only reason I held off for 8 years was to see if things could be ok, they are not AND because I felt God would punish me if I take myself out but this is too cruel for me so maybe eventually down the road when I do take myself out he will understand? He better.. I do not have a choice anymore, I am alone and slowly suffering every fucking day, everyone I am sorry. This is not a pity post so do not treat it as such. it is just my truth of life.

"I have had anxiety and depression issues for a pretty long time. Ten days ago, my appetite suddenly dropped off the face of the earth. It has recovered very, very slightly, but I have to force myself to consume 1,000 calories a day. I do not know what happened to my appetite.When I eat, I get some throat tightness and nausea, but I am able to keep the food down.My blood pressure has also gone way up, to around 145/95. I keep getting episodes of brain fog, feel like I cannot focus on anything, and lose all interest in things. (For instance, I was re-watching WandaVision before, but then the ""brain fog"" hit and I lost interest in watching it.) I also get occasional facial ""flushing,"" where it feels like my face and forehead are hot.What is going on with me? Do any of these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? Is this some kind of psychological episode, or am I afflicted with some kind of cancer that suddenly and completely destroyed my appetite? I do not know what in the world is wrong with me. Did I reach some kind of psychological ""tipping point"" and fall over the edge? Do I need some kind of high-powered medication to get back on the right track? (Note: Not currently taking any meds, used to take Lexapro but quit 3 or 4 months ago because it was making me too tired.)Any help is appreciated, at this point I just do not know what is going on. I am seeing a therapist this afternoon. Zero appetite for 10 days, blood pressure through the roof, brain fog, facial flushing - is this psychological, or a medical issue? Help!",0
"All this time I knew something was wrong but I never really knew what. I thought I hated my body, I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me, I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay, although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed, I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously, in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting, and while my friend cried I started laughing, because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies, I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw, to read, to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied, I drank, O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life, but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me, it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me, if someone hurts me, if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late, to eat too much or too little, to feel tired all the time, to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself, I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression, and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality, just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different, I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling, and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now. I think I have been depressed for years but I did not know",0

My reflections of the weddings (that I know I was at in the flesh) I experience in the same manner as I envision how your current life is like, as if I am a passive observer, as if I am dead or a ghost. I saw a picture of me at your wedding and I remember feeling so out of place in that world, I recall it now as if I were never there, disconnected and a complete stranger. Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever see you again, I imagine our lives forever separated as if that were the answer but it does not really seem any different than its ever been even when I did appear at various holidays and family gatherings.My life today is just a meager attempt to scrape buy, do the bare minimum just to keep living for what? I do not know. I work by myself and mostly just sit in my truck and read when I should be working. I do not really care. I can get away with it so I do it. I would not say I am depressed, I can get by most of the time without ever having a sad thought: most of my life these days is characterized by indifference. I think about trying to change my life in some way but mostly nothing comes of it, I do not really care. I am just another life amoung millions of others doomed to die in obscurity. Sometimes I see myself as having potential to do great things but then I take revenge on this cruel world by becoming a martyr who will die with this potentiality in my grave. At times I wish I had been born thousands of years ago instead of today. This modern world is grotesque and foreign to me, the paths in life we are limited to tread are dehumanizing. Sure, many people make their own path but I lack the strength and imagination. I do still dream of the perfect life. For me it would be a life of endless travel. There are so many places in the world I would love to visit. But then again I know I am doomed to live my days out in this miserable country, in this pathetic world of an era that cannot even give us the satisfaction of failing so we can create something better. No. I am afraid man is doomed to stagnate forever in the filth of democracy and freedom, mere titles and images while the few toxic hands of corruption really &lt;i&gt;live&lt;i&gt; on the backs of the bodies that suffer in the transcendence of eternal hope.I am rambling but my point is this world is lost to me. I do not have any hope, and without anything to believe in a man cannot be said to exist. I suppose this is why I experience your presence, current and past, as a ghost or as if I have never existed all along and this life is only a dream with my body a mere paroxysm of nerves whose only force is born in the desire to exist.Looking at these words I probably will not send this message. But this is the gulf I so desperately want to bridge but I know my breath is lost in that void so sending it is still the same as not. If I am practically dead already why not make it official? I can never send you these words; how could I? My life is so diametrically opposed to yours. I am afraid I am doomed to live like this. I am deathly afraid. I have no place here. A message to the void",0

Not that it matters. I would not want to be a real person anyways. I am not a real person. I am a collection of tired tropes and stale clichs.,0
I am 16. I failed 10th grade because of struggling with online school and now I am on probation for truancy for 6 months. That really is not that big of an issue for me because I can pass the drug tests and I am a mostly behaved kid. My parents are divorced and they do not get along at all. I see my dad maybe 2-3 times a month and its only ever for a few hours. He beat me once when I was young and I had a horrible stepmom who neglected me and verbally abused me for years. He never got in trouble as my mom did not press charges but that and my stepmom basically ruined our relationship. I have a girlfriend with severe depression and anxiety issues. I will not go into specifics for her sake but Ill just say her alcoholic father caused a lot of her trauma. This girl means the world to me and I want her for as long as I am alive but i just do not know anymore. She smokes weed and vapes and it kills me to watch it. I always try to convince her to stop but she says you know what you signed up for. When I try to talk about it she makes me out as the bad guy every time. It genuinely crushes me like nothing else. All but 1 of her friends are what Id consider addicted to weed and nicotine and they are horrible influences. I try to tell her she needs/deserves better friends and then she calls me controlling. I truly am not controlling I just want the best for her. Her mom and I have discussed it and she agrees with me. Idk it just feels like I am trapped but do not want to escape. I just got my first job at Kohls and i get paid $10/hour more than minimum wage so I feel like I should be happy but honestly I just do not care. I feel like my life is just running on repeat. Same bs day after day and I am so tired. I do not have the guts to end my life but I just want it to stop. I feel lost and alone and like nothings worth it anymore,1
"Does anyone else find that waking up in the morning is the most depressing time of day?

"I am a 24 y/o male if that matters. I had struggled with Bipolar 1, ADHD combined type, and Panic Disorder for 12-15 years. 6 months or so ago I finally stabilized. I do not get extremely attached or paranoid anymore. I have not had a manic or depressive episode in a long while. Things can still bother me but only to a reasonable extent. This is the most normal I have ever felt. However there is one thing that still sticks to me without fail. I have absolutely nothing I feel like I want to pursue or interests me. My future is secure due to family circumstances so I am not necessarily in a hurry. I have also gone out of my way to try and find things. I started exercising daily, I tried making new friends and made some, Reading, Video games, I tried playing sports again. I have had girlfriends in the past but I have never been in love before. I am not really interested in pursuing it currently either. Being dependent on someone else to be happy seems like setting yourself up to be depressed later. I tried a lot of things and sometimes they felt fulfilling at first but then that same empty feeling comes back and I lose interest completely. I forced myself to do these things because I thought maybe I needed to try them first. But I was always right in the end and I just lost interests like I thought I would. I am not pessimistic either I know there are many things I am good at. I just have no interests in them and everything is so boring. Honestly I am fairly confident I will not find the answer here either. But I figured I would type this out anyway. Has anyone here had this problem and overcome it and if so how? I am aware the answer to this type of thing will vary between individuals and is always vague. I have seen posts of people with a similar issue. I want to try to fix this problem so I can finally secure my happiness. I want to find something to dedicate my life to or at least that I will feel happy doing. For some reason it seems like I will never want to do anything and that bothers me. Lacking a passion or interest for anything",0

"The person who smiles at you and tells you how great their life is, probably feels similar to you. Many people experience sexual, verbal or physical abuse. The person you are so jealous of could be a day away from suicide. I cannot promise anyone here anything, but you might as well post your story here. If no one replies, they are probably in a similar situation and scared to give you advice.Many people who commit suicide immediately regret it and try to save themselves. This is why it is so difficult to drown yourself because your body literally will fight your brain about killing yourself. Not to mention the fact that people end up mentally retarded or other physically handicaps from suicide. it is NOT THE ANSWER!!!!! if you are reading this DO NOT COMMIT SUICIDE.",0
"Today was a really rough day. I am currently in a residential treatment program and away from my family and today (I guess technically yesterday) fucking blew. It stated off with a conversation with my mom where she confronted me about having issues with her and my dad. She was incredulous that there was anything she could have done that I had a problem with. This is a woman that sent me to weight watchers as a child, called me a bitch, in a family that referred to me as Cinderella (because as the only girl, I was expected to do extra chores) chose my brothers over me time and time again. This is the woman that on the Mothers Day outing I had planned just for the two of us took a call with my brother for the first 20 min of our meal together. The mother that complained I made her miss the World Series because she had to visit me in the psych ward. And then made sure to bring it up again 10 years later. she is never said jack shit about that time except for remembering how she missed a fucking baseball game. Yeah I have fucking problem with you. The rest of the day was just killing time while I heard about everyone is plans for the 4th (I am American). Obviously things are not going well - I am in treatment for a reason, and will be here for a while. But days like today are excruciating. Its like I feel like I am on fire, or someone is poking me with a thousand needles while a weight presses down on my chest and throat, making me feel like I am choking and suffocating at the same time. I cannot stand it. Truly. Right now I just wish I was dead. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I am so tired, its exhausting. I feel like I have lived a million years - I cannot take it. I feel like I just was not meant to be here. To be alive. I have no purpose - each day is just a series of activities to pass the time. I am not in any immediate danger, I am literally being checked on every hour, anything sharp, all meds and anything else potentially dangerously is either locked up or has been removed from the house. But that does not make it any easier. I am terrified that there is no hope for me. I am unfixable. And doomed to suffer for god knows how long. No one should have to endure this many years of pain. A goddamn lifetime of it. I do not see the point. I do not want to be here anymore. I want to die. cannot sleep and tired of being in this unbearable pain",1

"Hi, people. Just wanted to vent a bit, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 5 months ago, been taking Zoloft 50mg since then. Overall, Id say I can see the results of the medication, my mood has significantly improved, anxiety has slowed down. The thing truly fucks me up right now are the random insane moments, which are triggered by trivial stuff; I get extremely upset, not only with myself, but also with my partner, who is the most supportive and important person in my life. When I have an episode, usually it starts from him irritating me, or doing something that really hurt me, but later on whilst sobering up from the insanity, I cannot remember why I felt hurt in the first place. I cannot even think about those reasons while arguing or accusing him of something.I hate that after such a long time I am still incapable of recognizing my paranoid and insane behavior. All of the feelings, my anger, pain, paranoia, fear, they all seem real and reasonable. I know my partner and he knows me better than anyone, that is why after everything I feel like a piece of shit, remembering all the disgusting thoughts I had about him.I hate that I can notice a pattern of a really toxic behavior from my side, that happens leas than it used to, but is still here. My boyfriend is really against increasing the Zoloft dose, but all those episodes resulting in self-harm, arguments, panic attacks and the worst bit, hurting my partner.How are you guys dealing with your mental health issues and loved ones? hurting people whom I love most",0

My head is underwater. I have no social circle. No hobbies. No job. No dates. And almost no car.And to top it off, I am completely jacked in the head anymore over this. I have developed the severe anxiety. My depression has gone through the floor. I have no support system. Family does not talk to me. I do not know what to do I cannot keep a grip.I do not care what anybody says we are not in this together. I have always felt sort of isolated from people my entire life but now, I do not want to be this isolated from people. I feel like outside of the coronavirus, we are just divided in every way possible and as much as I am misanthropic, I cannot be this disconnected.

People usually say the best way to make friends is to find others with common interests. And logically that makes sense. But I have been depressed for so long that I have long since developed anhedonia. I cannot remember the last time (or any for that matter) that I had a passion or interest in anything. Nothing is exciting. Nothing is fun. I never want to go anywhere or do anything. I am very boring because of this. I feel really stuck. I know self isolating is killing me. I know I need to make friends. But I have literally nothing to talk about. All I do is work and sleep. I do not even really watch tv or anything. How can I make friends like this? How am I supposed to make friends if I have no interests/hobbies?,0

Lately I have found myself asking myself the same question. Well.. even more than usual.Is this even worth it? And what is different now is that I even ask myself that question even when I am having a good moment. A little moment of enjoyment or happiness. Like.. is this little moment I am having here even worth all of this? Is it worth living for? Because lately it seems like its all just meaningless. Like its not worth it in the end. I cannot believe I have gotten to the point where Ill even question the good moments. I mean fuck. Why cannot I appreciate them for what they are? Why do I have to question if a good moment I am experiencing in life is worth it all? Any normal person would be happy and appreciate that moment.. Not question if its worth living for. Is this even worth it?,0

"Its been a year since I left college due to a lot of shit happening in my life. When the pandemic first began I resorted to online classes. It was not so bad at first.

I tried 4 months without medication, then 3 months with Lexapro which helped but not enough, then 3 weeks with Effexor which made me insomniac and I started Trintellix 2 weeks ago.I lost my job and had a breakup during this time.Time is passing and I do not feel coming back to my old self. I lack motivation, joy and enthusiasm which were part of my personality ! My question is : 8 months is quite a long time for a depression episode no ? I hear everybody struggled during 3 to 6 months.Does this means I will never return to my level of happiness and functioning ? Am I doomed ? I am loosing hope..",0

"Yesterday on the train there was a street performer (NYC), and before he say for tips he said Hopefully my song makes you feel something, because if you feel something at least you know you are alive and i almost cried.I do not understand why being alive is supposed to better than not being alive just for the sake of feeling. Why the hell is feeling the way I do better than ending it all? Who the hell are you to assume that what people are going through is better than death??Went to be around 1am, woke up at 8am, and could not get out of bed until 5pm. I do not have any groceries so I went to buy a deli wrap and it was not good I am just sitting here in the para watching everyone else be alive for the sake of it and I just do not get it.How the hell is this city so densely populated but so lonely??

"I know this might be a feeling that many can relate to. I have had depression more or less half of my life, due to many different factors and things that have happened throughout my life.I used to drink alcohol quite frequently and even smoke a lot of weed. However I have quit those things completely a couple months ago, and that has been another journey in itself.I knew that indulging with different substances that make me high/drunk, I pushed the feelings of anxiety and depression aside, not making them disappear but just forgetting about them for the moment. Until they came back. For the last couple of months now I have been completely facing my shit, unable (or should I say unwilling) to ""escape"" by any means. I constantly have the feeling that I want to cry all the time. Not just a little, but I have the feeling that I want to let the floods out for real, got so much tension inside and I know I have the potential and that it would feel much better afterwards. But at the same time I just feel so empty and cannot cry no matter how hard I try. It feels like those emotions somehow are trapped deep inside of me, and I would need a terrible reason to be able to ""let go"" of the pressure. Instead of just letting it go and getting rid of it, it just keeps on staying where it is, and it is really frustrating... Want to cry but cannot",0

"I am not going to go into why. its not important and why does not matter. i tied a makeshift shitty noose. i found a sturdy enough thing that could probably support my fat ass frame. and i stood on a stool. i was so ready to take my fucking life. i stood there. nothing was going to stop me and i jsut kept thinking about the life i was going to leave behind. my found family, my hobbies, my future living with my found family. but nothing was going to stop me. and i was just sorting out the noose but i could not get the fucking belt (I am fat so i have a huge fucking belt) around the pole thing. i was actually going to do it but i could not get it around. and when i collapsed on the toilet, i got a message from my friend/ a member of my found family; telling me that he loves me. this broke me. i feel so shitty. i cannot leave him behind. i cannot leave him or my brother behind. then my younger sister walked in to ask to borrow something. if it had worked my nearly 14 year old sister would have been the one to find my corpse or dying body. i cannot do that to her.I am not going to kill myself yet. if i do i will ghost my friends for a few weeks and then do it on a day when my sister is not home. i cannot fucking believe myself.

"The title is pretty much what I wanted to ask. That said, I am brand new and have only done one test stream so far. My only steaming goal is to get 4 consistent followers by the end of the year, but right now I am not expecting viewers.I am starting with hidden object games. And all you would need is a discord account and any mic you have.(Laptop, from a phone, web cams mic, anything that works.)I love discussing story, characters, inspirations, and any random topic that might pop up.(It will pop up, my ADHA meds can only do so much.) Other non game related topics are things like food, art/crafting, anime, living with depression and other psychiatric disorders, plants, animals(I have 3 reptiles), fandom, books, and shows. With other stuff you may want to talk about.I am doing this to help me work on my confidence and public speaking, as well as a way to have fun. So it probably will not be seen by many(or any) people, so it is more like us talking over discord with me screen sharing. So it is low pressure and you can have veto power over deleting the stream once over.My schedule is very flexible and I live in the US MDT or GMT-6 time zone. If anyone would be interested, feel free to comment/massage me if you want to talk more about it. I do not know anyone who like hidden object games so this is my attempt at finding someone.Again, no pressure. And thanks for reading this far down Would someone like to talk during small twitch streams? No long term commitment and no judgement if you need to back out.",0

My family is a reck my brother has some unknown illness, he can literally only eat 10 things at max, my mums struggling with body image and is trying her best to help us. I wish i could tell her everything. around 2 years ago i started isolating myself from the small group of friends i had, one by one i distanced myself till no contact with them i do not even know the reason why, the thing that is destroyed me most is breaking up with this guy i was head over heels for. I gave him no reason and just blocked him i still see him out in public rarely and have a full on panic attack after. I have no friends , I am homeschooled because school have me extreme anxiety.. i really cannot do it anymore I am scared to die but i know i cannot do this for much longer. The only way out i can see is taking a bunch of antidepressants, melatonin and whatever i can find in the cupboards.. i do not want to fight anymore i cannot do it anymore",1

"So, something amazing happened yesterday! A job opportunity basically just sprang up into my face. I completed two back to back phone interviews with the owner and manager, then boy the next thing i know we are talking about start dates and pay and...I am terrified? I should be thrilled. How lucky am I that this happened? I should be jumping for joy because I desperately need a job, have not worked in a year due to covid, and this could be a great fit for me. But all i keep coming back to is how much I want to die. How anxious at failing i am. How depressed i am. How incapable I am. How I have walked this road before; gotten a cool job, dealt with the stress for a few days, and then broke under the weight of constant suicidal ideation. Its a pattern I, and the others in my life recognize. To the point that everyone I tell when getting the news mentions that ""oh well I am sure you can handle it this time"" This time...But I am so afraid. I am so depressed. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. But i know i need this job. Please. Help... Self sabotage, please help",1
sorry for bad english it the first time i write in english since the high school. . Since the covid I lost my job as a waiter in a small restaurant because of the closure of this restaurant. I tried to find another job in the industry but a lot of restaurants close. So it is harder to find a job . I sent a lot of CV but I could not find a job. I have already been told by a boss that he just hires women for a family breakfast restaurant . With all the failures I decided to go back to school. School was difficult for me when I was younger I had a diagnosis of autism. They put me in an autism class where I learned nothing. Even I was of the same level as normal people .So i just go away from the school system. Now i want to go back in school because I want to work in the IT field. So I started to take steps for my return to study. I was interested in a program that a friend of mine told me about that gave money to go back to school. I was very excited I said to myself Wow he will give me money to go back to study. So I have to apply but the problem is that the program was no longer available. I was sad but later he had another program like that that trained people for computers. So I applied I made every meeting everything was fine. But finally the person in charge of the program explained to me that I was not aiming for the program because I was a white man.The program was just for women and minorities. So I did not let go and I tried to look for something else but I could not find anything. I feel like I am worth nothing in the society. So now i do not know what to do anymore. I just want to kill myself but I am scared of painful death. Anyway i got nothing. I am sure if i kill myself nobody will care. I want to disappears maybe just going in the wood and just walk until i die to starve where nobody will find me. sorry for bad english it the first time i write in english since the high shcool. I no longer see the light and I am tired,1

Through some miracle I got a bf, but I should have known it was too good to be true. he is sick of me and probably going to leave me soon.I waited all my life for it to be my turn, but I think it is never happening.

"Hi all! I could really use some advise. Thank you in advance to those who comment. :) Long-story-short, I feel trapped in unfulfilling office jobs that do not align with who I am as a person. Every day I go through some sort of existential crisis, and lately I have really been wondering what the purpose of life is. On top of this, USA's economic and societal climate really makes me depressed. Jobs I would *actually* be happy with would not pay a livable wage. Cost of living is too damn high, and greed is so rampant amongst corporations/rich people. Anyway, I have been working in my ""professional"" career for about 7 years now, but I still feel like a scared little girl when it comes to taking on responsibilities and talking to other people. All the information that comes my way at work does not stick. I do not have interest in retaining it, and it is really starting to bite me in the butt. My career motivation is tanked, and I feel very guilty about it - I know this is not who I really I am... Seriously, I can be a very driven and happy person! But especially lately I really just want to shut myself away. I want to quit, but bills need to be paid!So my question is: **how do I get out of this rutt and find fulfillment?** I have tried therapy, anti-depressants, career coaches, exercising, and eating well. I have also changed jobs a couple times, gone back to school for Master's, etc. But over time I sink back to these bad feelings. **How can I gain confidence in my job and skills? What will make me WANT to wake up everyday?** I miss the feeling of ""the world is my oyster"". The world is shit. Advise on Fulfillment?",1
"I have a friend who just gave up on life. He hates who he is. Ever since he got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he depended so much on that.I want to help him but how can I help him when I am suffering like him?

He will not get help. He refuses to share to any people his problems. He gets ""jealous"" when people are there for someone but not him even though he will not tell anyone. How do I help a depressed friend who does not see a point in living when i also do not see a point in living?",0

"I have been experiencing an increasingly hellish hell for many years and I am closely nearing the end of what I have the strength to bear. I have money saved to purchase a few acres of land in another state, but my depression, anxiety, and confusion of navigating the adult world has thus far hindered me in making this long-held dream a reality. Too scared of making a mistake, scared of risk and change, even if it is change for the better, something I know I want deep down. So to stimulate motivation, I have made a pact of life and death with myself; if I fail to aquire a new home by the latest deadline of this upcoming December 31st, I will take my own life by opiate overdose in a motel room on January 5th of next year, probably sometime in the evening. It does not help that I want to die anyway. A death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal. It seems like ending my own existence would be easier and a more certain win than anything else I have ever done as it seems as though my hopes and dreams are nothing but shattered shards of failure and regret. I want to see beauty in life, a reason to keep living, but darkness is blotting it all out now. I hope things change soon. They have to or I am going to die. If my moving plan is not successful by the end of the year, I am killing myself January 5th, 2022",1
"tl;dr: I am doing better, my friends are so proud of me, I finally believe in myself and I see a bright future in front of me. My family does not. They keep insinuating that I will not ever get better and that I am lazy and will not do anything with my life. How do I not go back to the dark place I was?A month ago was the first time I had felt genuine joy since 5th grade. After so many years of suicidal thoughts and apathy towards my life and future I started to have plans for my future, I started to think about studying languages, I started to say no, I finally was standing up for myself.I now know I can do whatever I want to do. I now know I have friends that love me as much as I love them, and they are so happy that I am doing better, that I hang out with them, they are proud of me. And my therapists have also told me that I am clearly doing better, and they are also happy for me.I feel like I am rediscovering life, without this dark veil that was covering my face because of my past and my family. Speaking of family, unlike my friends I feel like they do not trust me to move on and have my own life, they demoralize me and I just feel like I am going backwards on my progress when I am back home (I live with them). They keep saying things like ""you have to work, you have to study blablabla"" ""what if you start acting like before"" in a very condescending and negative manner, as if I was the lazy useless person I thought I was for all these years. And whenever I talk about doing things with my life they are always like ""yeah but if you want to do those things you have to start working otherwise you are not going to do anything"", like, I know all those things, they do not need to constantly repeat that all the time.They do not believe in me and I am scared that I might go back to where I was. Does anyone know what I am talking about? I do not know if any advise can be given but that would be cool. After almost a decade I am finally doing better. My friends are very proud of me, but my family does not trust me to move on with my life",0

I woke up today not really remembering what I did last night, just knowing it was bad and I was a fucking mess. I have woken up so many times with this same feeling. I am plagued with anxiety about all the nights of my life I have sketchy memories of. How did I get home? Did I do something bad? Was something bad done to me? Why am I bleeding? Did I sprain my ankle? Was I flirting with that girl/guy? Did I try to kiss them? That sort of thing. Stupid decisions (if you can call them that...) after too much booze that I will spend the rest of my life worrying about and ruminating over. I should have learned better by now, but on the rare occasion that someone invites me to do doing something social it is always the pub, and one drink to calm my nerves about being outside in the world soon turns into one too many and me crying or falling over or trying to kiss someone I am not even attracted to just to feel something.The solution is surely to stop drinking, right? I wish it was that easy. I wish this drunken idiocy was my biggest problem but it is just one way of ""coping"" with the depressed, anxious, lonely existence my life has become. I hate myself. I hate everything I am and everything I have done. And I hate everyone else too, and society and the world as a whole. I have been suicidal on-and-off for over a decade. I try to convince myself to keep going but experiences like this just remind me that I am not meant for this life and it is not meant for me. I do not have any friends, and when people try to be my friend I either ghost them or do something to piss them off while intoxicated, because I cannot soxialize sober. I am so done",0

I had people tell me to grow up, calling me a sensitive bitch, swearing at me and villainising me because I am pissed off a nine year old girl was burnt to ashes. Can I not just be angry at that!?And I do not care that the morticians are kind. I do not care that the bitch who did her cremation sent me a tacky memorial gift and a necklace with her fucking powdered bones in it that I did not ask for anyway. I know all the goddamn machines my sister was put through, and I got her back in a fucking plastic bag, and now I am sitting here, drunk off my ass, holding my sister's ugly ass urn and crying. I do not want to hear from the cunt that turned her into this that she wanted to help me.Then there is my mum too, saying she had my sister burnt so I could have her ashes to help me cope? And the morticians talking about wanting to comfort me!? And get this, the bitch who did it is a self proclaimed""grief counselor"" and Is coming over on Thursday to help me with my loss when she made it ten times worse. Can I not just be angry about this without being told I am projecting. I do not care that nobody wants to cremate a kid and that it is hard to do, but if you do that you deserve to feel like shit. Let me be angry. Stop defending the people who are in my eyes monsters and just let me grieve. Let me hate these people. And the woman who did her cremation, Heidi, fuck her. And fuck her constantly saying my sister's ""with God"" and constantly thinking this is comforting when I was the one who was abused by a priest. I cannot even hate religion without being told I am wrong. Just let me be angry.",0
"Every day I think about just doing it and being done. I do not want to die. But its all I think about now. I do not know how to make things better when what makes me upset is out of my control. I am stuck in a place I am not happy and I have no way out. Well, one way right now I guess. How do I stop hating the life that I am living? I do not know. I do not think Ill ever know. I do not even think I deserve to know. I do not know how to stop",1
"i am wasting my days, i come from school eat, shower lie in bed and repeat i do not have the energy to do much, i am hoping to change this summer but i am getting more mentally ill in this house i do not have anywhere else to go, i feel so alone and i am so awkward , i have been thinking of running away but that is not smart. i hate my household i do not like myself , the life i am creating , i do not like being alive i hate everything",0
"I have gone through multiple periods of major depression that sometimes lasted years. I have tried countless medications while seeing many psychiatrists and psychologists. I am dyslexic, and I was physically and emotionally abused as a child. I come out of it by just trying to improve my situation as much as I can no matter how hopeless it seems because its the only good strategy. No matter how hopeless it seems, it can all turn around in six months. Random bad things will adversely affect us, but so will random good things. Do what you can with diet, exercise, meditation, prayer (if that works for you). You can come out of your depression.",0
"First time I applied for transfer to university from a community college in 2020 (for 2020-2021) they rejected me.Then the second time I applied for transfer (for 2021-2022) they rejected me.But I would not give up so easily.I filed an appeal the same day USC rejected me, back on May 28th.The shittiest part of it all was that decisions were due on May 31st but that was a holiday so they email me on a Friday afternoon and leave me in darkness that entire weekend.I emailed USC Undergraduate Admissions almost every week asking about my appeal.Then, a couple days ago, on Friday............AGAIN.........they rejected my appeal.What is it about sending out damaging emails on Fridays when noone can do anything on the weekend?So, I have been having another crisis because USC was my life and NO I DO NOT believe in matches reaches or safeties.Call me entitled but I live in DTLA and USC is in DTLAbut that does not mean anything to them.Every time I think about having to go to CSULA, I get sick again.I applied to several UC campuses, but the problem is the UC campuses are highly competitive despite being public institutions.I am a California resident and there is no decent university for me to go to.Then some lame people got salty with me because I had the nerve to criticize CSULA because the administration is shit.So, as a black woman who has been rejected everywhere, I have never felt more low.*But what I cannot understand is the obsession that people on Reddit have where they go through all your past posts in order to get information then come back and attack you on a current post.*Man, if Reddit was not anonymous, I might actually give a shit.**Thank goodness that reddit is anonymous.**I had people in r/USC and r/ApplyingToCollege telling me to get professional help and calling me delusional and saying truly disgusting things so my posts were deleted because of all the people making inappropriate comments which was not my fault.People are animals and have no forgiveness in their hearts nor any concept of understanding.**Freedom of speech is dead.**I am not asking your opinion.I am simply expressing my disappointment and there is no right or wrong way to do so.Why would I give a \*\*\*\*\* about what anyone thinks on an anonymous forum?Reddit is by definition the cowards way out because everything here is anonymous.Noone made you come here and whatever you say on Reddit has no meaning.People need to seriously chill out.You think whatever people say on an anonymous forum has any affect on me?Come on, man.I came to express myself, not to start some huge discussion on why these top universities are so damn corrupt. But you know damn well they are corrupt.I really want to use COVID to take a gap year but as a transfer that would mean I would have no recommendation letters,etc.I am unwilling to put myself in another dysfunctional environment (CSULA) where I will never get what I need and I am the only black female in the major (again) and noone gives a fuck about me because the one golden boy in the major gets all the glory.You do not go to college just for the education.You go to university in order to engage and learn from the world and people around you.And I resent the fact that all the work I did to have a passing GPA is in the toilet now.But my life is already in the toilet.Every time I make a final plan, I chicken out, but I hope this Christmas I will be able to go through with it. Nobody cares",1
I ate pills last night. Someone have ant ideas to help make me not puke? My body want to die,1
"I have been struggling for many years with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Now I am at an all time low and i cannot take this anymore. Everyday is the same, i have no energy for a single thing, people around me keep telling me that there is so much to live for, but i cannot see that in my dark place and it has not gotten better in years. The thoughts of ending my life and writing goodbye letters kind of give me peace. But other thoughts just keep flooding my brain and it is too exhausting to take it any longer..Maybe someone can relate. I do not want to kill myself, but i want to die",1
I want it to end I am feeling so bad,1
"I do not know if this subreddit is for me but i want to kill myself really badly. I have an eating disorder for almost half a decade now and its been all over the place. I have never been fully diagnosed. But half a year ago I was still sick but skinnier since then now i gained like 7kg which does not seem much and i can just work it off but i keep eating and i never was really suicidal but now I am actually considering, i know it seems strange but i feel this huge self hatred for the fact i cannot seem to control my intake anymore and that makes me so crazy and sad, because i know i can just lose it but i cannot seem to do it and it feels like i lost my mind. I feel like this is such a rude reason to attempt suicide because others seem to have it harder and i should be grateful, which i am. however, this is keeping me from living like i want to and be the person i desire to become. the problem is that i have to eat everyday but i cannot without feeling extrem guilt and hatred while eating more? i feel out of control and it makes me not take care of myself, because i do not want to shower due to my body. I habe a BMI of 20 which is normal but i feel morbidly obese. i know i might cone across as rude, i do not intend to be my eating disorder is making me suicidal",1
"for reference, I am a fifteen year old transmasc who has no diagnoses simply because my parents will not allow me to get tested. back when i was twelve, i dealt with the suicide of a loved one and received no support from my own family simply because it was an online relationship. and before you say anything, i know hes gone for sure, i saw his whole obituary.i was doing better, but always started crashing around mid-july until i do not know, maybe september. i neglect to take care of myself and start to withdraw socially.this year was particularly bad. i had recently discovered that I am trans and with the fact that i have to be extremely closeted due to transphobic parents, i suffer from extreme dysphoria.last night, i relapsed. i had taken my scissors out of my room to prevent it but i guess getting rid of my nail-biting habit just caused my nails to be sharper. i was clean for two years and now i do not know what to do with myself. i wish i was just normal. disappontment",0
"I cannot fucking do this anymore. I do not know who I am. I do not know what I am alive for. I do not know why everyone around me seems to love me and praise me. I do not know why I feel so lonely, every single fucking night of my life, even though I have so many friends and family supporting me at every passing moment.I do not understand this. I do not understand any of this. I cannot love myself. I have tried. I have tried to forgive my actions, because everyone does things they regret. But I cannot forgive myself. I want to punish myself. And the only punishment good enough for me is ending my life.Everything's spinning around me. I cannot focus. I do not know what is happening to me. What happened to that happy little boy who never cried? What happened to the carefree adolescent who ignored the trauma he had been through, and forgot everything?Why did the memories have to return? I am scared that every night it will happen again. she will come into my room and rape me again, with a knife to my throat this time so I cannot fight back. Why was I so weak before? Why could not I fight her off before? Why did I let it happen for three years straight?I have caused my parents to hate each other. Divorce is a common word thrown around the house, and I honestly want them. They despise each other, even if they try to hide it. some days I wake up at 4 AM to hear them screaming, only ending when one of them leaves the house. I have split my entire friend group into two. All because of a mistake I made, which everyone has forgiven me for. But if they really forgave me, they would not be doing this. They would not be split even now. I cannot do thisThese people, ALL these people would be better off without me. My head is hurting so much. I cannot sleep. I hear my sister downstairs, maybe I will watch some TV with her. I would like to finish the show we are watching together before I die.But then again... is it really worth spending your last moments watching TV with the girl who raped you? I am at my fucking limit",1
"I am struggling for 6 years with depression and suicidal thoughts. I always thought that keeping myself at work was the best thing because ""I would be sleeping the entire day if not working"". No! Big mistake!it is my 4th week on sick leave because of the mess I was feeling day after day and you cannot imagine the difference I feel. I am connected to myself. I am even smiling! I feel useful again, even not doing shit the entire day. I needed to sleep and take a nap after waking up. I needed to not think about the annoying coworkers. I needed to go for a bike ride at 2pm on a Wednesday. I needed days in front of TV, eating crap and watching stupid shows. Doing nothing is so needed...People, if you go to work every day feeling like shit, crying during work hours, you should talk to whoever supports you and discuss about taking time off. Be responsible about it, but take advantage if you can do it. I have an office job, which of course makes it easier as I am not my own boss. But we read so much about being at the very bottom in this sub, that I wanted to give a bit of light that we can have better times.I am 100% sure that I will not feel like this forever, I always had ups and downs with my mental health, but I learned some important lessons about myself. Everything that can help me get out of a depressive episode in the future is very welcome. Burn out and depression",0
"Creating new people, by having children, is to impose all the burden and agony of existence on them. It is morally very problematic, because even the best lives leave much to be desired. For example, 40% of us will develop cancer and 21% will die from it. 9.5% experience depression at some point in their lifetime. 1 in 4 people have some form of disability. This is a terrible odd.Think about all the avoidable, unnecessary suffering we are imposing on new beings. To impose such a risk, just for the sake of fulfilling one's desire to have kids, is morally very problematic.Procreation ought to be criminalized. Allowing more people to suffer, by creating new people, is wrong",0
"For me, it is when I have time to sit and think about things. What do I want to do, what is missing? it is when I realize how much fun I used to be. And how much fun life used to be. I suppose it is depressing when you begin to realize that the older you get, the less there is to look forward to and diminished excitement increases while your energy levels and motivation sets new lows with each passing week. Nothing helps anymore. Numbers in the bank account, nice things, spare time, excercise, not even time with ""family"". Because something else I realized, I do not know anybody anymore, and now, nobody knows me. Not the real me. there is just this now. This thing that is leftover after society, poor decisions and everyone else has done their thing to me. Poor decisions. Faith in the wrong people. I am starting to think that life itself was a poor decision. I tried before, haphazardly, honestly out of boredom. I was literally so bored and alone that I literally tried suicide because fuck it, why not? Sounded fun at the time. Now, I only enjoy things vicariously through others. Like a ghost. Life has become a spectator sport. And you just watch and wait for the clock to wind down, because there is nothing else of interest to do, or it involves other people, and I do not want to ruin anyone's day or life anymore. there is more but who cares anyway? I could write a book on this shit, but so what? Who would read it? This society's become a dead end for people like me. And now, honestly I do not even care anymore. it is been fun, here and there, I guess. What depresses you the most?",0
"I am 18, have a loving family, passed my first year in college, have a great best friend, have a roof over my head.Yet I cannot get out of bed and would be fine if I just died right here and now.I do not know, mostly just typing this out to see if it makes me feel any better. Hope you guys are ok. The worst feeling is not knowing exactly why you are depressed.",0
"I have the noose ready , I tried it out it will definitely work. But my pussy ass backed out as soon as I got dizzy. JUST GOD WHY cannot I DO IT. IT WAS SCARY. Just knowing it could all end right then. But now I am prepared. Now I know I can do it anytime I want. After years I finally have a fucking working almost painless plan. Hopefully working haha. We will find out someday. tale of a fucking pussy",1
"I can attract women, but I cannot have them because I am on disability due to mental illness. Its torture. it would be easier if I had no chance and was as I am. Then I could easily die. I wish my sex drive would stop.",1
"I feel like a miserable human being who makes the lives of those around me miserable. That Ill always be miserable no matter what I do. I feel drenched in it. It sinks into my clothes; it clumps my hair together into chunks; wears down my bones and makes it hard for me to move and think. It impacts those that love me the most. Nothing in my life will get better. I have tried to better my life and it does not work. Everyone in my life has either hurt me in some way that I cannot forgive, or have been hurt by me in some way that I cannot forgive myself for. I feel disgusting. I am a disgusting person with a disgusting body and a disgusting, sick brain that makes me think disgusting, sick thoughts. 7/10 people with my personality disorder attempt suicide, 10% will be successful. A lot will be dead before 30. So why even bother? (Vent) I feel like my existence is misery",0
"The world is so depressing I hate it. I just want to kill myself, and I found a way to do it. The US is falling apart, I think sometimes I can talk people into seeing the truth but all I get are insults I am just so mad I cannot fucking deal with conservative people they are ruining the world right now, talking people's rights away, wanting to kill people who do not think like them. I am tired of being mocked and told I am stupid or fat or I cannot do things cus I am a woman, I am tired of men, of bad drivers, or rude people, I am tired of living in a backwards town and worrying if I will give covid to my family again because no one will wear a mask. I am just so sick I rather kill myself. I am am stupid, I am worthless I am fat everyone can get fucked I hope this is the end of the world and we all fucking die... I will go first! See you all in hell. Fist time in a while",1
"I have noticed that talking about my depression and anxiety does not really give me the greatest results. This especially holds true in romantic relationships. I have told just about every woman I have dated I have struggled with mental health and all of those relationships ended. I told them partly because it was all that was on my mind, partly because I wanted comfort, but also a part of me thought I should be honest and transparent about it and that somehow it would be appreciated. I think I have bought into this notion that men should be more vulnerable and talk about their feelings. For a while I legitimately thought whining about my feelings was the right thing to do, despite how dumb that may sound, because no one told me otherwise. I also reasoned that If a woman talked to me about her mental health struggles, that should be an invitation to talk about mine. I had a mental breakdown in front of my current girlfriend. Things are fine now but she told me she does not want me to constantly talk about my anxiety because she also has anxiety and it stresses her out. A few years ago I would have gotten really mad and upset, but I can now understand why that would not be something that a woman would want me to talk about all the time. I said okay that makes sense, and we moved on from there. I genuinely appreciated the feedback, because it was information that was helpful and would allow me to course correct my behavior. After that interaction there was a rough patch but things seem fine now. Every interaction I have had with her since then I have made it a point to be more confident and I sense that she is more attracted to me because of it. I really aspire to not bring up my anxiety and depression to her anymore. I will say one caveat though, if something catastrophic happens Ill talk about it. Some people may say I should just find another woman who understands, but I do not really think a lot of women out there want that out of a man. If I stormed away from her and found someone else to whine to, the same thing might happen. It might even be worse. I think she cares but she does not want to play the role of a therapist.Anyway, I have been reading a lot about personality traits, and the one trait that is not helpful in any situation is neuroticism. All the literature says people who have this trait struggle immensely in romantic relationships, and I believe this would explain my prior struggles. Disconcertingly, its been said that it is almost impossible to change your personality traits, but I am trying to implement tactics that will at least help and I do believe I have made significant progress over the past few years. I just have a long way to go. The thing is, I want to be in a stable romantic relationship, and I am to the point where I would rather just hide my neuroticism and act like a manly, confident man, than allow my neurotic tendencies to be integrated into my interactions with my girlfriend. On the surface this may seem dishonest, but I truly believe the one thing that is causing me trouble in relationships is my neuroticism. If I can keep that at bay while continuing to work on improving by myself, that is what I intend to do. I really do not but this vulnerability crap anymore. I just do not believe women are attracted to it. Maybe if its done tactfully its okay, but when you are at a really low spot its very difficult to do that. I really think my only solution towards a long term relationship is to suck it up and be a man. I know this sounds inauthentic but I really do not want to be an old lonely guy in my 60s or 70s with no wife, kids, or family. If displaying my neuroticism leads to that outcome, I will gladly suppress it all day long. On a side note, I believe that the fact that I can avoid showing my neuroticism is an indication that I am improving. In the past I would not have been able to hide it no matter hard I would try. I am absolutely committed to doing everything I can to improve my mental health from here on out, despite how insurmountable it may look. TL;DR I am willing to hide my mental health issues in order to have a relationship. Talking about my depression causes bad outcomes in relationships",0
it literally never fucking gets better. i genuinely cannot do this anymore. every second of every day i think about killing myself. I have tried so many times. all i want to ever do is get drunk or high or drive at 80mph just anything that kills me somehow or just makes it a little easier. I am so fucking tired of replaying everything that happened in my head and feeling like I am utterly worthless. i turn 18 in 2 months and as soon as that happens I am buying a gun and shooting myself in the face. cannot make it any longer,1

"Even just an attempt, to show that I am willing to go to the edge. Otherwise I am just a pussy incapable of killing themselves who seeks help because they are weak. Is it logical? No, not really. But I also want to show that my self hatred is real, not a joke or something casual. I do not know. I guess I am so surrounded by mentally ill people who HAVE attempted that I feel the need to join them in order to feel validated. Besides, I HAVE wanted to die for years now, with passive suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts being extremely common in my day to day life. But now I realize that its an actual option, and I cannot finish the job.Its a weird cognitive dissonance. People who seek help before attempting are strong, but I never will be. And, honestly, I crave hurting myself so often now that its started to affect my relationships because all I want to do is destroy everything around me. I cannot seek therapy or help until I commit suicide.",1
I decided to not choose death but choose life. Wish me luck and bye death. I chose life.,1
"I do not no what I am waiting for but for some reason my patience is running low. I use to pray to the universe, god and goddess but now I cannot bring myself to it when I do its like I am not heard. I feel like I do not belong anywhere I am too emotional for people to understand why I am like that. I barely understand myself I have BPD but when I am having these moments of self hatred or overthinking I loose it. I can convince myself into killing myself at that moment. But I told my little sister Ill be here for her and told my love ones Ill always be here but for some reason I cannot seem to have someone by my side because I am worried Ill waste their time or I am too annoying to something. So I rather tell them I am ok then wasting their time with me. I stopped going to therapy because I felt bad. I do not know why I am writing this. If some person read my post I appreciate your time. &lt;3 Having Hope ...",0
"how the fuck am i supposed to logically reason that that does not make me a bad person? by reasonable definition, that is exactly what it does. I have loving parents, i have grown up in a middle class first world. i have no medical issues. i can see with my eyes, i can hear, i can touch. I am a physically functional and privileged human. having depression does make me ungrateful. It makes me unnecessarily pessimistic and bitter. that actually is the definition of a bad, unlikeable person, that i do not want to be. it is a good thing i hate myself. it really is. I am not allowed to be depressed. it does make me a bad person that i am, especially considering everything i have been handed in life",0
