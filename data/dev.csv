Life is fucking shit allways has been i have had enough my Life is going nowhere i will not become anything in Life How do i make sure i die this time I do not want help i want to fucking die,1
"Hi, I am looking for some words of advice and comfort here.A month ago, during an argument, my boyfriend (24M) revealed to me (22F) that he is suicidal. He was furious to have said it and became upset with me for having brought the truth out from him. I was never under the impression that I acted inappropriately at the time, but over time I realized I disrespected a boundary I had no idea existed. I made a mistake I have so much trouble understanding. And a part of me was relieved that he told me-- I also learned he has been seeing a therapist for a year, but after the argument he told me he was no longer interested in therapy. Since this happened, my boyfriend and I have not seen each other. we have known each other for three years and have dated long distance through the pandemic. We initially continued seeing each other (long distance, zoom and facetime) to play videogames and talk about our days as if nothing was wrong, but my emotions kept ""getting in the way."" But from the beginning of this crisis, he said he could no longer trust me or the relationship because he cannot bear to think about the problem and my fear and sadness are extremely upsetting because they cast doubts on his recovery. I understand where he is coming from and objectively, the nature of an intimate relationship goes against his desire for distraction and levity -- I have accepted this. We have started a two-week no contact break this week. Before then, I did everything I could to communicate my understanding and faith in him and his recovery, even though I cried due to my anxiety about the situation. But he has been so strong and sought out help before-- I must believe he has the courage to overcome this. As I am someone who struggled with depression and some suicidal ideation too, it breaks my heart to know my boyfriend is suffering like this -- and that I only found out now. I know I brought joy into his life, but without ever knowing truly how dark his mind could be, I am distraught that he must have felt disconnected and alone.I deeply understand I am not *the* solution to his problem. I am working through the paralyzing fear of being unable to do anything for him. Again, he only wants distraction now. We are currently on a break to sort out whether he wants to continue in the relationship. We continue to affirm our love and care for one another. As you might understand, the flux of our relationship interacts very poorly with the intense sadness and anxiety about his personal suffering. I do not know whether I should stay or go, regardless of his decision. I am determined to accept what he wants but I am scared if what is to come is a lifetime of not knowing if he is okay. it is an impossible problem and I am just waiting for a sign. I love him so much and can only pray for him to recognize his strength -- to find whatever he needs. My anxiety gets in the way of my seeing signs of hope and reassurance -- he tells me he is keeping himself stable my continuing to see friends and do activities--I trust that is exactly what he needs, it might be just fine to put off the deeper work it might take to overcome his sadness. Really, I might just be terrifying myself for no reason. My therapist and family tell me it will all be okay because he told me about his suicidality. And he did so in some detail. Even though he was angry, I could not help but feel he might be relieved to share his dark thoughts. And I cannot breathe a word of this to his family or friends, because they would make it worse by wanting to talk about this problem with him, when he absolutely does not want to. This also is a bit scary for me, but I can understand why it has to be this way.I know there is not much I can do but manage my own anxiety. I am learning and adapting, and finding strength. I hope he does exactly what he needs and that the outcome of his decision can preserve his happiness. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and I am terrified",1
"Yeah, that is my question. If mentioning that you are getting suicidal ideation enough? Or someone has to nearly attempt or make an unsuccessful attempt? I am not interested in going there but I am just curious because I have seen posts where they were sent to psych wards for the smallest of the things. Serious question. What is enough to end up in psych ward in the US?",1
I am going to kill myself in tonight. Have everything set. I want to go but I feel for my family. This will reck them but I am not set up for life. I am a shitty human being,1

"My mom was my only other teammate in life. She died suddenly and unexpectedly. She was 57, and I am 28. No father. I am alone. I am stressed from life, loss, and handing her things without a will. One other person close to me; spends time with me but not present in my mess with me. Unable to be communicated with currently. Its been almost 2 months and I somehow feel worse than I did the week of her death. I have a lot of regrets about our relationship. I know I am only human, but she deserved more in life than what she got and I should have given more. I hate knowing that after all of her life, she went back to the nothingness that we were in before we were born. I do not want to die because I think Ill be reunited with her. I want to die because I will not be without her anymore.I am 4 days shy of not having SHd for 1400 days. I am struggling tonight. Alternatively, I want to drive away from the city and turn off my phone for a day. Stop being a mourning daughter, an invisible girlfriend, a tired pet parent of ill animals, a lawyers client, and executor, etc. I truly believe Ill take myself out one day. Maybe Ill give myself the same amount of time as she had. Sometimes, I just do not see how I can make it that long, though. I do not know how I can love the same things I loved before she passed. What did I even love? I foolishly gave a lot of my heart to others. that is about it. I do not have the energy. I do not want advice or solutions. Thank you for reading. My mom died. I am finding it difficult to keep living.",1
"(if anyone wants to know the story ill post it in a comment under this)I am thinking of overdosing myself with my moms medications for her diabetes, i have strict parents and i want to get away from them but I am scared of fighting or rebelling against them. I am already 25, I am old enough to make my own decisions for fucks sakebut when i think about overdosing on my moms medications i started thinking about stuff like what if they do not get me to the hospital in time? what if i actually died and its frustrating because even now I am feeling scared i do not want to traumatize my boyfriend or anyone else with my suicidei actually already have a plan on how i would die, it would have to be me being separated and distant from everyone i know, i wanted to die peacefully and on my own so i know i will not hurt anyone too bad i want to end my life because I am weak and a coward",1
my mom accused me of stealing her drugs again and it makes me so upset because i have not and i do not know why i had to get such a fucked up family and narcissistic mom. I am crying in the bathroom and i can hear her in my room going through my stuff and I am so sick of dealing with this stuff. she just was all nice and asked if i wanted to watch a movie like 10 min ago and now she is mad again. i feel like ill never be able to get out and do what i want to do with my life so what is the point. there is nothing for me. i just wish someone would see how I am doing and help or something but i know that no one will. i feel so stupid and i know ill delete this later I am so sick of this i cannot do it,0
"I know as a fact that I was depressed as a teenager, because I did not have friends, i slept all the time and all i could think about was suicide.So that has always been the parameter that I used to measure my emotional state through life. I have always thought ""I am not feeling as bad as I felt those years so I must not be depressed"", even if suicide popped up in my mind here and there.I am 25 now and I have been going to therapy for the last 2 years and only now it came to mind to ask my therapist if I have ever been depressed since I have been going there. She told me that I am, and that depression comes in many forms. In my case, sometimes positive events make me ""snap out of it"" for brief periods of time and then I am back into it.I am so sad now because I feel that I have had this sickness for more than 10 years and this has put so many obstacles in my life, and I will never be happy. But I guess this is the depression talking.I took an appointment to go and see a psychiatrist because I want an official diagnosis (and because it is free in my country), but I am scared of taking meds and I feel hopeless.tl;dl: you do not have to be sad all the time to be depressed. Look out for other signs. I just found out I have been depressed all this time",0
"I am heavily considering moving to online school so i do not have to deal with seeing normal people my age all happy enjoying their normal lives. I am done with everyone thinking I am weird if everyone is so fucking bothered by me existing I am going to be a hermit and not interect with people., i cannot even fucking walk because girls think I am following them and being a creep.i do not like the way i am ether ok? i know I am weird and ugly but can i just be left alone? i get disgusted looks from girl and weird looks from everyone else. i just want to be left alone on some mountain in new Zealand. I am not a human I am defective and i should eather be killed or left alone far far far away from humanity I have 95% given up on being part of society and trying to have friends",1
"pretty much the title. i just cannot bring myself to care about other people anymore no matter how unkind and cold that is. but the thing is I am also very self-aware and i know i do not want to recklessly say anything harsh and insensitive to other people-- i think them but i just never say them (but mostly this is just because i am too tired to deal with the drama that will ensue if i hurt other people with my words). so what i do is just feign responses they expect from me. they only like it when you respond that way but the moment you start even mentioning your depression, it feels like they already want to leave the conversation or move on to the next topic. they suddenly do not want to listen to anything you have to say and that really fucking hurts because most of the time, that is really all i need (not that it will make my depression suddenly go away, but i think it helps me get by a little). so yeah I have learned to just keep repressing everything and feigning every response to the people around me. i feel like I have become skilled at feigning a positive mood in front of other people and feigning interest in what they have to say but the truth is i actually could not care less about whatever they say",0
"No more long holidays already, routine life, you get to see friends less often and some people drift away. So much less free time and more responsibilities, life is such a lonely and depressing journey. I wake up in the morning still feeling tired and dead on the inside Life after leaving school sucks so much more",0
i feel like my life is too good for me to be feeling sad and yknow.. suicidal I am too privileged,1
"To preface, I will not ever do anything, so do not worry, but good god if I am not having dark thoughts all the time. have not been able to keep food down for months. Used to drink a lot of hard liquor during the pandemic and had increasing difficulty keeping the alcohol down. Eventually something snapped and I have not been able to handle pretty much any food (or alcohol) very well. I vomit almost every day. The doctors are not sure what specifically is causing it. I have had all sorts of diagnostics and red herrings, but treatment has not led to any improvement. I go to university in an eastern bloc country where everything is dubbed. While I was in the US, I figured Id see a movie while I still could watch something in the original language. I waited so long for this film to come to the United States and was so excited to go see it. But, I was dumb and had a bit of lunch before the movie, and 45 minutes into it, I could feel the nausea creeping up to an unbearable level. I tried to hold it as long as I could, but I ended up sobbing and vomiting into my cup.Financials are really putting me on edge too. I am behind schedule on the bit of software I have been working on. I need to buy new glasses - they are held together with tape right now, but when I look at the prices, I just cannot justify it right now. I am burning through savings so quickly. I need to renew my visa as well, pay tuition, book my flights, etc.I want to get a pizza tonight to relieve some of the stress, but I know I am just going t beat myself up over the cost.I am in a bit of a LDR being in the US and my girlfriend has all sorts of medical stuff to work out relating to her transition, so I am on her sleep schedule right now. have not seen the sun in weeks and as she gets more distant, the fewer people I have to talk to during my day.Speaking of my girlfriend, we have not been sexual more than a couple of times during the past 6 months. We do not send each other any videos, we do not use the sex toys I had gotten us (one of them is still in shrink wrap!), we do not sext, we do not watch any porn together, and we never talk about our fantasies. Making it extra hard, every time we have looked at porn, she exclusively gravitates towards women. I have never once seen her looking at men. She was propositioned by a woman recently and admitted that she had fantasies about saying yes, but seemingly never has any fantasies about me.I feel so physically unwanted, unattractive, and unsatisfied.I feel like my life is slowly collapsing. Alcohol abuse has made it so hard to make it through the day",1
"I am 18f and every day i wish i was never born. it seems like my life is a series of mistakes and every mistake i make only makes things worse.i was sexually assaulted when i was a preteen and it fucked me up mentally. I have struggled with depression ever since and its impacted basically every part of my life, and because of it, i live a pretty sad life. its hard for me to make friends because i have trust issues and i cannot open up to people. i either have the motivation to do my schoolwork or i just blow it off. maintaining relationships with other people is a hassle. i can count the number of friends i have on one hand. i just graduated high school and i was on my way to starting the next chapter of my life at the ohio state university. i was accepted into a summer program and everything. things seemed to be looking up until i got hit with one of the worst waves of depression I have ever had. suddenly everything went downhill. i could barely get out of bed, much less get to my classes. every waking minute was spent either napping or wasting my time on video games instead of being a productive member of society.my behavior got me kicked out of the program and my family found out. they said they are not paying for my tuition anymore. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself, i had such a bright future and i threw it all away like a fucking idiot.there is nothing left for me here anymore. I am the family disappointment. this is my legacy. I am going to kill myself, and in a couple of years, no one will even remember my name. things are only getting worse for me and i think tonight is when ill end it.",1
"I hate what depression does to me and I also hate that there was nothing I could do to stop it from happening I was bullied at school I never had any friends this lead to drug abuse that just made the situation worse I am living life fine now but my depression and anxiety always comes back to haunt me when I least expect it I have been having suicidal thoughts recently but I know I would never act on them I do not want to die I want to live my life , life is great at the moment but depression says otherwise I try to be open because there was a period in my life that I was closed up and did not want to talk about anything and I lost a year of my life wasted on video games that made my depression and anxiety less but it never solved anything because as soon as I got back to real life it comes back to haunt me I have depression",0
"It seems that there are few quick fixes to this depression struggle... I am on the good side of this struggle now.. but I have realized it was a long road... but so worth it. Even though you can go and read other people's stories and read books of how to deal with this struggle... it seems that each person has to write their own book of how to get out of this hole. I have read so much material... listened to so many podcasts and youtube videos, taken meds, gone to counseling... but I still had to write my own book.I had to do my own experiments to see what worked for me. I wrote what worked for me down... and then.. when I went through some difficult times.. I got my unfinished book out and read it.. and tried the solutions in MY BOOK.... and came up with the one(s) that worked for that particular day.. Start writing your own book today and find your recovery. Slow road back",0
"I have been very depressed for quite some time now. My daughter is autistic and I never feel like I am doing enough for her. I have been bullied all of my life and do not have any friends. I cannot date due to how my daughter is and because I only attract abusive men. I have gained a bunch of weight and my looks have gone down the drain. I am also just not very smart and I have never been talented at anything (even my own mom cannot come up witanything that I am good at, other than being a mom). I have been wallowing for a long time over these things and it is been exhausting.For the past week, though, I have been thinking about how the only one that matters is whether I am doing enough for my daughter or not. I have only been selfish by worrying about whether I have friends, romance, looks and talent. It finally dawned on me that my purpose in life is to love and care for my daughter and to only strive for things that will directly benefit her. This is actually helping me to become more focused on my goals, and I am actually looking into going back to school so that I can get a better job (purely to benefit her, not for my own enjoyment). I am also trying to be physically healthier, but this time it is so that I can be healthier for my daughter, not so that I can look attractive or for any other selfish reasons. Anytime I feel a bit down about any of these things, I redirect my thoughts away from myself and towards my daughter. I am finding that I am slowly but surely thinking about myself less and less, because I no longer matter to myself. I do find that I am a bit nervous to go back to school because, like I said earlier, I am not all that smart. Hopefully I can find a course that will work for me.Moral of my story is that the only thing that matters to me is my daughter and that I do not need any of those other things that apparently contribute to happiness. I have stopped caring about myself, and I actually feel a bit better for it.",0
"I cannot believe that only such a small amount of people of all people on earth are depressed. This number is not right is it? ""&gt;264,000,000 people of 7,800,000,000 people worldwide suffer from depression"" - Is the amount really that small?",0
"I am only 16 and I fucked up, I have a 1.2 GPA so school is fucked, I am going into my sophomore year, I was in honors classes and now I am in what my school calls behinds classes, basically where the not so smart people go, and I am there. Ever since 6th grade I have felt burnt out, I have not felt happy even though I should. I have a loving family, everything I could ask for, and friends who tell me how much they care about me often, yet I feel nothing. I just cannot handle feeling nothing anymore I do not even feel human. Everything is coming crashing down and I do not know where to turn anymore and I am seriously contemplating suicide and I am scared I do not want to die but it is all I think about now I feel like my life is completely over",1
"I cannot live like this anymore. Random painful memories pop into my brain throughout the day. I just want to forget. I just want to forget everything, all of the trauma I just want to forget it all",1
"I am miserable. I have been in depression for many years and I do not ever see myself getting back to ""normal life"". I am 21 and from france, I live on an depression aid for now, I hate the idea of work because there is nothing I see myself work in for a living, the idea of working just repels me (and I have been searching since very young a work I would like to do, but nothing). I have a psychiatrist, I am on medication and tried so many different medication (still tries new ones from times to times) but I am at a point I really see no end in my depression. I have the two things I wished I had for a long time, which is money (from the depression aid) and a cat (who I love, but she kind of hates me for some reason). I already did 2 suicide attempts in 2017 and I wish I succeeded. I hurt from depression, some unlhealed trauma I do not know how to heal, some wounds more deep I still do not know what it is from, I hate everything about my body, my life. I live at my parent's because I cannot really afford an appart just from my aid, and even if I did I would probably let myself die of hunger as it is really difficult to make or even just grab something to eat sometimes. I hate my mother, she is toxic, she made clear she wished she never had me. I do not really like doing anything anymore. Medication is not helping anymore. I considered talking to a psychologist in addition of my psychiatrist and have even an appointment for August but I am hopeless and deep down I do not believe anything is going to help... Anyways, I am tired... I am just thinking about ways of ending my life I have not tried... I have nothing to live for",1
"I cut all of them off in high school and dropped out. I do not have a close relationship with my family. They love me and I love them but I keep them at arms length, I am not comfortable letting them get closer. I feel so alone. I wish I had someone to do fun things with, or to just chat. Realized I have no friends",0
"i feel like I am either on the verge of a break through or that I will be stuck like this forever the issue seems to go very deep. almost on a fundamental nature. you get what you get in life, and you make mistakes, and you have moments of happiness, but none of it is ever in your control, I cannot help but feel like I am imprisoned In a body. And that I desperately want life to mean so much more, or to see a truth, to get some kind relief that is not drug related for once, but the suffering goes on how do you stop hating yourself",0
"Dear Stranger, I am going through a lot of pain and internal turmoil myself. I do not know how to get through it. I do not know if any of this is worth it and if anything is ever going to feel good and make me content. I do not know if anyone will ever want me since I am an insecure piece of emotional baggage that is fat and dumb. But everyone deserves to be loved and cared for (at least I believe so). So to whoever is reading, I love you. You might be thinking that its not a sincere I love you so therefore it does not matter. However, I am sure that if I took the time to know you and spend time with you I would love you (if anyone ever needs someone to talk to I am here for you). there is no reason not to love you. Even if you do not believe you are worth being loved because of what you have done or who you are, well sucks for you because you are not changing my mind and I. Love. You. You do not get to choose whether people love you and I have made up my mind. I do love you. I at least want to love you. I am not trying to be some corny, heartfelt poser, I am actually quite crummy myself. I just believe that a lot of people are victims of circumstance and suffer through choices not of their own, and need all the love they can get. I know this is a dumb, weird letter. Who writes letters anymore anyways. I am just someone on their bed not able to cry myself to sleep tonight trying to make it so maybe someone does not have to cry themself to sleep. Love,Some Stranger A Letter.",0
Every little inconvenience makes me want to cry and wish I was dead. No matter what I do I just want to cry all day and wish life got better I would give anything to stop crying,0
"Nothing is helping the pain I am feeling right now , crying does not even give me relief What the fuk do I do then cannot even off myself if I wanted to. Trapped in my suffering I am so tired of crying. it changes nothing",0
"25/m just got off another job interview that I failed. These thoughts have returned, and this time my mind cannot fight them anymore. I just want to be happy with myself I just got rejected by another employer. I am currently just so lost.",1
"I am going to put this here since I got no one else to tell. The past 2 months my mental health has completely crumbled. My friends did not reach out to me, I always had to reach out to them. It was just really obvious these past 2 months that they do not care, never did they reach out and even ask if I was okay. Just nothing. The fact that I am a lonely loser just amplified itself these past 2 months.I always thought that reaching out to a friend that you think is having a bad day was normal. My friends all knew I have depression and yet not one message of comfort was sent to me. Friends were always important to me my whole life but now that I am experiencing life after school, everything just feels so hopeless. I am stuck with depression and it feels like no matter what I do, I cannot just get rid of it. My friends always said to improve myself and whatnot, if it was that simple then I would not be this depressed and suicidal.I just felt so lonely these past 2 months. After I reached out one last time to one of my friends, he said the reason they do not reach out and check up on me is that ""we are adults now"". After he said I should just toughen up. Those words have been stuck in my head the past week. I do not know what is right or wrong anymore but what I do know is that I want to move on, I simply do not want to live anymore.Just then I removed them all from my social medias and friends lists. The amount of pain I went through my life just outweighs any good that happened. I never had a girlfriend at all and the fear of being lonely forever is eating away at me. Seeing that those friends do not care enough just made me more and more depressed by the day. Being told to toughen up is just bullshit. All these bullshit excuses and words they tell me, I just had enough of.I just hate everything, I cared so much for my friends and the care just was not returned. Anyways guys, I am probably not going to post again and honestly I feel extremely suicidal right now so this might be my last post on Reddit. Sick of it all",0
"I recently graduated High School and I am attending university in the fall. So many things are going well for me. I have wonderful grades, and I got into the program I wanted at a prestigious university. I have friends I am so grateful for. I have all these wonderful things, and yet all that seems to matter to me is how ugly I find myself, and how I will never find love or be loved because I am just not normal. I have internalized everything my sister taught me about myself as a child, about how much of an embarrassment I am because I do not act a certain way, or because I am just a fucking weirdo. I do not think my parents ever defended me; but now that she is messed with them, they have a problem with her.I cannot go a single day without reminding myself that I am repulsive, and ugly, and that no one will ever take me seriously or love me. I am not committing suicide right now because I do not know how to do it without inflicting too much pain.I feel like I know the way out of this, that it will and can get better, but I am not letting myself believe it. I am the only person not taking myself seriously, it seems. I feel so alone. No one knows this about me IRL. I want to die. I have been depressed and suffered so much from anxiety this past year. And no one knows, and no one is seeing it happen. And I do not know if I trust anyone to talk about it. I am so tired. Terrified and tired",1
"They do not understand I am depressed, that I have been experiencing low moods because I had a traumatic experience. I promised myself I am going to be honest with my feelings and everything that I do but all I get is misunderstanding that I am crazy. I do not want to go to s psychiatrist not because I do not want to get healed but because my parents will think I am crazy and they will use that against me in my near future. I do not want to walk around and be known for having mental health issues and a degree, again not because I do not to have one, but because mental health is very stigmatized and looked down upon where I am.The thing here is that I want to go to a psychiatrist secretly in the near future but my mother keeps pestering me what is wrong, talk to me, etc. etc. I honestly believed her which is a dumb move to be honest so I opened up to her because you know, I want to ease her mind and at the same time, I want to let her see what I see. The former option was checked on her checklist but not the latter option. She saw what I see but she did not understand, but instead she used it to increase her pride or ego, told people without my consent, I honestly believed (and it should be) that if there is anything private, you should be honored that you out of all people are the one they tell it to so you do not say it and also take pride on it that way friendship is formed, tell to my father, whom I hate for reasons I am not telling, and tell to everyone who is not at all understanding. Now everything is going too fast and I lost everything I hate my parents so much",1
"hurt and broke up with my boyfriend, there is nothing holding me back anymore. I have been wanting to do this for years. I am a horrible person and i deserve to die.

So I have been on Effexor 75mg ER for about 3 years and recently my doctor decided to change it to Wellbutrin. I ended up taking 32.5mg for about 2 weeks to ween off it but as soon as i stopped the withdrawals started beating my ass. I am currently on day 4 without it and its unbearable. the physical symptoms are horrible i have brain zaps throughout my whole body and i cannot even stand up. not even going to go into the emotional symptoms. just wondering if anyone has gone through this and has any advice because this shit sucks Effexor Withdrawls,0
"I have wasted, 18 years of my pathetic life. I have quit literally done nothing. Now I am 18,trying to pick up art, but I am lousy at it. I could have started when I was much younger, but no. You know I was suppose to have a medical care. Phlebotomy young happy, but come test day I fail. The one thing I studied my ass off for,and I fucking failed.so no license. Alright I have got other options, no. Forgot to do the process, to continue the classes, graduate high school with nothing. Great now what. do not worry I got ? Oh yeah. I am a complete fuck up. ADHD, autism,dumb and, wasted my life hitting controller playing video game. So I am a 18 year old infant. No social skills no friends, and despite being 18 feel like I am 81. Old dying mind slipping burden. Honestly I want to take a long walk at night, then find a peaceful place to end it. My lifes over, and I do not feel like Ill make it past 20. Honestly I do not feel human, probably due to autism. Either way I want to peel of my skin. I hate the way I look. Want to wear a mask. Or have my mind transferred to a robot. I just feel close to death at this point. I want to die,but I am to scared of the nothingness I am a coward. 18 years",1

"I can never fully get rid of this fucking curse. It always comes back to me. For no apparent reason. It makes me miserable. It does not matter what is going on in my life. I am surrounded with family. I have a good job that I enjoy. I am poor but I am not so broke I cannot feed my kids. What do I have to do to stop feeling like I am the only one who knows what this is like? To stop feeling so alone and isolated from everyone I see. What will it take for me to stop praying that I do not wake up again in the morning? What will it take to make my heart not so heavy?Why does it feel like my father and mother have died when I know they are alive and well? Why does it feel like no one cares about what I feel? Why do I even worry if someone cares? Why do I even care?I write this for myself and no one else. I am cursed with this. I was made to suffer, an unforgivable way of life that haunts me for reasons I do not know. The way my brain works, I would never choose to let someone else experience. I will never have children of my own blood because I would not wish this way of living on anyone. I could not live with myself knowing I prolonged this cycle of self hatred and loathing. Nothing good comes from it. it is time like these I want to drink myself to sleep in hopes I choke on my own vomit and die, like I should have before. Why did I have to get saved? It would have been painless. Now I have to deal with this tainted and tormented mind. Why cannot I just be happy? I do not expect to always be happy. But why should I feel like everything has come crashing down on me for no reason? My family is fine. My life is moving along. I am not hungry. I am sheltered, and I provide shelter to others. I am a hard worker. I am a caring person. What have I done to deserve this?Fuck this shit. Fuck medication. Fuck my brain. Fuck living like this. I do not want to hurt others because I am hurting. that is not how this works. The drugs do nothing. The alcohol does nothing. Talking does nothing. God does nothing. I do nothing. My life feels like a sad fucking song that is stuck on repeat and I hate it. I have done nothing to deserve feeling like this. I have done nothing wrong to deserve my head turning against me like this whenever it chooses to do so. I have fought it before and I will fight it again, but one day I will become too tired and weary to resist. I will lay down and die like it is meant to be. I know someone might read this and I do apologize if you can relate to even one thing I have said because this is a fucking living nightmare and we do not deserve this. it is that time again",0
"I am lifeless, I live only for the hope to be with the one who will understand me. Its impossible to describe the pain I have felt emotionally. All I have had was myself to keep me from totally giving up, telling myself ,to hang in there, it will all get better, I am strong, I am lying to myself. I see straight through everyone, everyone I have known have all been fake, I know they do not care about me. I have cried myself to sleep multiple times this year. I feel like I am the only one going through this even though I am not. I try, and I try to be the best person that I can be, someone who can be accepted by others. I want to die. Whenever I feel an ounce of happiness the pain always comes back to me. I am tired of living.",1
I cannot rely on family. I cannot rely on friends. I am all alone in this. I cannot do it anymore. The only thing that remotely helps me cope is alcohol. I have always been such a calm and loving person but recently my family and friends have made me so mad I just want to scream and beat someone to a pulp. That feeling scares me because I have always been so loving and now I have this anger and frustration that I feel is eating me from the inside out. So I try to deal with it by drinking better to hurt myself and my liver than other people Everyone is unreliable,0
"I live in a small town in iraq/Kurdistan dating is not allowed in where I live and there is not much to do besides soccerSo I would watch porn all day and text girls who I would never meet because they are in different countries.I got tired of wasting my time like this been avoiding porn for 7 days I literally had a dream last night about sex.

"I think I should kill myself, not because I am depressed or mental. (I am) Or because of how much I hate myself and hurt inside. (I do) Or even because of all the shit I have to deal with from people. But because what is the point of any of it? Why live just to die? should not I just opt out? it is going to happen anyway. In the end it does not even matter. Nobody will know I ever existed 100 years after I am dead. I might die tomorrow anyway. Why wait? Give me an actual reason. Why should I have to go through all of all of this, just to reach the end and have everything wiped clean? I think I should kill myself.",1

I have friends but my social anxiety makes it hard for me to see them. I have an easy time making friends but I am so flaky that they always end up giving up on hanging out and I do not mind because I like being alone anyway. I have been in 3 serious relationships in my life and all 3 have been very physically abusive so I do not even want to try with men (or anyone) anymore. I have not had sex or anything in like it in 2 years, even though I was in a relationship . I am lonely asf but its like my brain will not let me trust others.

I am very self destructive. I tend to ruin the things I find comfort in by overthinking and just putting myself down as if I am telling myself I do not deserve it. I do not deserve having things that make me happy. I do not know how to stop myself from doing this and naturally it messes me up causing my depression and self hatred to just spike. Its ironic seeing as my whole goal for this year was to gradually learn how to love myself. I am just incredibly tired of myself. I am very self destructive,0

"I generally feel fine whenever my depression is away, but it comes back there is this giant tornado following me around. I have trouble sleeping, doing the things I like to do, communicate with friends and family, etc etc. Even if I wanted to talk to people about it, its hard to truly trust anyone. My family gets overly concerned to the point where I feel like a child, any friend I felt like I could open up to about is not there so to idiotic drama or social distance (not THAT social distance, just not catching up regularly), and my fianc rarely seems to ever show the emotional support that helps. I hate opening up to her because its always alienation or an argument, and the idea of both makes me feel so fucking alone. I have started cutting myself at the age of 27 because it feels oddly rewarding. I just do not know why to do anymore. Any time I try for therapy it always ends bad: whether the therapist uses me as a pawn for their psych experiments, completely forgets to pencil me in when I have an appointment with them, or generally just get a vibe that I cannot trust this person. I have trouble trusting anyone and its lead me to contemplate suicide again, and I fucking hate that. Even writing this I feel like I am just asking for attention but I am serious at an ends here. I do not know what to do and I am sick of being pushed around and told me my life is good and I should be happy. I am sick of being peoples pawn and punching bag.

Because even though employers ""say"" they support mental health, we all know the levels of acceptance and denial in the work force, and she does not want to look ""weak"" and ""emotional"" in front of work competitors and miss out on promotions.

"The only two paths for those who have severe depression are madness or suicide. I think that way because once you get into this dark hole that is depression, when you get to the very bottom, there is no way to go back, at this moment you will see only two paths, madness or suicide. Either you are brave enough to take out your own life, or what you will have left is madness and sociopathy.

First thoughts when I wake up are suicidal. Atleast 50 times a day it crosses my mind. I went far enough to eating 20 xannax and trying to load a shotgun years ago but put wrong size she will in it. (Was fucked up also in public) still detailing with that in court. Been stressed bout it. Learned not to act on it anymore. Tired of feeling like this but I also same time do not want to die. Sober I will not act anything just worried when I get fucked up randomly get an impulse something could happen. I do not clean I do not go to work I live like an animal and just do not care. I am not me anymore. Severe depression and constant suicidal thoughts,1

"People always say how only you are in charge of your life and shit, but that is just objectively not true. You need other people to do things like hire you, befriend you, love you. there is only so much you can do for yourself. I was the youngest child in a homeschooled family with 3 other kids and by the time I popped out, my parents had pretty much stopped caring about what happened. I spent most of my childhood alone or hanging out with the characters I created in my head. All of my sisters and family members are constantly talking about how I ""missed out."" Missed out on the fun things they used to do, missed out on having a dad who gave a shit about me, missed out on most people even giving half a shit. I have been so starved of human love and affection that I recently realized I was in love with one of my characters. How pathetic is that? I am like Lars and the Real Girl but even more cringe. Relationships have never worked out for me, platonically or otherwise. The only friends I can keep around are all hundreds of miles away and if they knew me in person, they would probably leave too. I did everything ""right."" Went to college, got straight As for the almost decade I was there and yet I still cannot get a job that is not a scam, keep any friends around, or find someone who thinks I am worth more than just sex. I think I just grew up being socially fucked from being alone all the time as a kid that there is no coming back from it. I have been praying to gods that I do not believe exist to give me just one thing that will make life worth sticking around for for over a year and there is absolutely nothing for me here on this earth. Every day and every rejection I get from the outside world just pushes me further and further into my head and the paracosm I have created there. I know it is not realistic, but I hope that death brings me there. I see nothing in this life worth living for. What is left? Working slave labor hours to be underpaid and struggle to pay for a 1 bedroom apartment for the rest of my life until global warming fucks up the earth so bad there are endless wars and famines? what is the point???

"My Goodbye NoteI am tired, I do not even know where to start, but I am tired. Ever since I was little, my dream has been studying and becoming a professional in a career I can be proud of. I was the type to take college classes in high school so I could expedite the process. When I got the opportunity to move the USA at the age of 15, of course I said yes. Yes, dad! Of course I want to go. The land of opportunity, the land of the free. It has been more than 10 years, and I have been anything but free. I am 26 years old, and I have not started my career. I am an illegal immigrant. I cannot graduate, drive or work (unless I do so illegally, which has never been my desire; breaking the rules has always been my worst nightmare). Doing the wrong thing completely paralyzes me. I do not suppose dad knew what he was doing when he moved us to this country. And yes, I could have left, but it does not work like that in our family, where the man of the house is the ruler and tyrant. Leaving meant having nowhere to go with no roof over my head or food in my stomach. I have always struggled to make friends, I guess they all have sensed the brokenness that is in me and ran the other way. As the months go by, my interest in people diminishes. I want to be left alone. do not talk to me, do not look at me, do not breathe on me (please ignore all this and love me anyways). Just give up on me and leave (please fight for me). I understand I am hard to love, which makes this decision a little easier. Dad, even though you were tough on me, I know you were just as broken as me. I do not want to follow in your footsteps. I tried. I really tried. But I am you. Mom, I love you so much and I am sorry. You do not deserve to lose your only daughter, but I cannot do this anymore. Hubby. You have tried your best to be patient and be there for me. But my presence is a burden that you do not deserve to handle. I hope you find love again. I know you will with that light that shines through you. I have realized that a life in which I contribute nothing but pain and strife is not worth living.I hope it will be a light, painless death. I will sleep and hope to never wake again. My Goodbye Note",1

I have self harmed over them in the past but i know, as of right now, if they end up marrying this new person they are seeing i will off myself. I will not be able to take it. Not this time. Maybe they have not changed and this is only short term for them, but maybe it will turn out differently than our relationship did. I have spoke to my therapist about it and she had nothing to say except its an understandable fear. I want them to be happy. I want them to change for the better and not be alone, but this is still hard. I am alone. I still love them with everything i have. I feel i always will. I do not want to kill myself to make him feel sorry or any other reason other than i will consider myself completely unloveable.

"I am a (M35) who have been struggling with depression more or less my whole life.What I can remember, is that from the age of 9, I have been an extreme introvert that attempted suicide at many occasions but with the luck or bad luck based on how you look at it never succeeded.For many years I would not talk with people and had a temper that made people frightened and made some enjoy pushing my buttons until I snapped.Disappeared whole school-days and just sat at isolated places considering my options even trying to end it.First time was in a forested area outside my school age 9.Had a rope and decided ""it is time"".Trew it over a large branch and anchored it to another tree. Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son ""dad is going to work"" and he just said ""Bye"" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner. Never made a post before but here goes.",0

"Its something I think about everyday. How much better things would have been if I was not me, if I was someone else, someone more. I never wanted this life, to be born into this world.

And when those bad things inevitably come my way, I remind myself that I deserve it, and accept it with a smile.I have ruined every friendship, chance at love and happiness, chance of acceptance, quit every job I have had or everything I have done. Id planned to Kms when I turned 21, and now I am 23. could not even make that one on time :).I also know that I do not want to stay alive much longer, no matter what happens. I could have everything I wanted and it would not be enough, I do not deserve it. If I were a bit stronger, I would not be here to type this now.

"I am 32 now. I was never skinny, but I am gaining weight ever since. Now I reached 200 pounds while being only 5'10"". I realized I am really obese now (BMI over 30), though I thought my lifestyle was not that bad - I do not drink any sweetened drinks, no alcohol, I never eat junk food (no fries, hot dogs, tacos, no processed food). Sweets very rarely. I even have some amount of exercise (though I would like to exercise more, but I fail so much at it) - I walk or take a bike wherever I can, I do not have a car and never will own one. So it can be only worse.So the thing I am posting here is that obesity will kill me (and I cannot do anything about that) and I do not want to live past 50 anyway - just long enough to pay the mortgage and bring the kids past their teens. So I can start with heavy drinking, bacon and sweets in few years. Any means of death is horrible, but no one will notice this one - a perfect win. And if Covid or something takes me aerlier, I do not care - the sooner the better. I have not even taken my vaccine yet as I have been putting it off for too long. Can obesity/diabetes kill me before 50?",1
I ghosted someone because they were a bad friend to me and criticized me to the point that it made me feel like if I got into one more argument that I am afraid I would snap and try to kill them or kill myself. My other friend is living with him now and it means I might have to see that ex friend that I ghosted. Also my other friend has been ignoring me. I do not know what to do. I do not know what is going to happen. I am afraid if I ho over there something is going to happen that is going to put me through so much mental suffering that I will fall into complete horror and despair and do something crazy and kill myself. I might have to confront someone and if it goes bad I will probably kill myself,1

I am done do not want to take shit. Life is my story but works makes it feel so makeshift.(Sing) I am your sanity and you are ripping me in millions. The dark has took control and its coming for the killing. How could i ever get you to this feeling? You ever want to sleep forever i do not want to suicide I am too alive. Wondering why I am here and who am i? A pawn from dusk till dawn an expendable. Air dependable my soul and repenting I am unsendable. Bury me in ashes my grave. To life I have been a slave. The law says to behave and my soul is so depraved. I have been folded i have caved my stomach is packed like a rave. I am slowly choking.I have been done with hoping the empty of the empty. Dissociated from my senses the messages you send me. Depression Poem,0
that is it. fuck my life. Fml,1
I am just done with life honestly. no I am not killing myself but i just have given up on trying to find happiness. Its never going to happen to me done,0
"I take trazodone, it does help, but I need something to go with it. I just had a suicidal bout and they always come at some point I am just not happy, I need suggestions to give to my dr, cuz I have not been well in 5/6 years. Its really bringing me to a place I do not want to be What meds do you take",0
"Day 1:I do not have many friends so I am using this platform to communicate how I am feeling and maybe someone experiencing something similar does not feel alone. I am a 23-year-old adult, no job, in the fifth year of college, and has not graduated probably till 2022 and just tired of life. Sometimes I feel suicidal and want to rely on drugs, alcohol, or cut myself as a coping mechanism but I do not really want to harm myself. Neither do I end up doing any of those things because I know I will become addicted to them. I guess I want a specific part of me and my problems to banish for good and start a new like an axolotl. I never thought I would end up like this. I was a smart student with ambition in high school yet when I got out kind of lost it and do not know how to bring back my ambition and motivation. Thinking of seeking out a therapist and hopefully, I will feel better bc I am too young to be feeling like this. I do not want to be in my thirties with this type of thought bc I might just end it for real. This post probably will not help at all. It was just me ranting butty hey if you want to talk about your feelings go ahead and comment. Please do not comment on how my feelings are temporary and I will get it over it!!! lifffeee???????",1
"I just am so tired of being alone, last night I almost put a 12 gage thru my head cus I got nothin and no one. No one loves me no one cares. All I want is a relationship but noooo I cannot even make fucking friends. I try and try and try and everyone around me is in these loving long term relationships and here I am stuck. Alone. I am honestly just so done with everything. All I want is to be happy. I am so done with my life.",1
"i keep failing everything, every social interaction, every test, every sin thing. i cannot wait to kill myself.the problem is that i have no way of killing myself without pain, there is no building i can jump off, there is nowhere to attach a rope to hang myself, so I am just stuck. i guess ill have to wait until the end of summer vacation to kill myself that is the worst (yet the last lol) summer vacation i had in all my life I am done",1
She was the thing I worried about most when I considered killing myself. If she would be okay. But now she is gone. My cat died.,1
"This post is not going to be about my vivid and memorable bad experiences, instead it is going to be more general; but if you want to learn about my current mental health status, read this post, it will be helpful: [ So, as I remember, it is going to be my second post in here; I just hope that I will not be ignored again, as just like the first post... As the title goes on, I especially hate my generation; not because I feel different from them, just because they are so cruel, shameful, and disgusting; as I see more hateful things done by people, from this generation, I just want to take my local gun and put a bullet in my head; I am a sensitive person, and I have situationally both predisposed and bound or cued panic attacks; I am being affected so much by tragic deaths, broken relationships, unexpected depressing messages, and much more crisis triggering things... I will give you a current example of me being in depression, feeling low, and why; there is a known event going on these days, a crime which happened two years ago has just went popular on social media again, it is going to be her death anniversary on ""**14th**"" of this month; shortly, just after two days; I do not want to give out more details about the murder because I feel bad and uncomfortable with it, and I will explain the connection between my sadness and this event. On her ""**Instagram**"" account, there is a picture posted two years ago today; and when I went to the comment sections, of all posts, they were just so many disgusting and hateful comments; there were people telling that she deserved it, and some of them also making fun of her death; and another strange thing was, there were so many people from my country flooding the comment sections, which is so goddamn strange; and yeah, some of them were trying to be like the other foreign people and making hateful comments, and the other half was just acting like they have known the event for a long time; after seeing those things, I once again, hated world and especially my countries people, then I learned that the people from my country were coming from **TikTok**, and from a recent popular hashtag in my country; I feel so bad and sad that they are people out there, using these types of events to receive more likes and followers, to receive more attention; and yeah, do not you ever ask me again why I hate social media so much, especially **TikTok**. I got affected by the event so much; and those comments, they was the spice of the thing; now I am feeling so damn low that I just want to end myself, I am done with everything, I just want to go and stab the murderer in the neck so many times; my anger about this type of events are just uncountabl, and because of my character and psychological personality, I always blame myself for such things and hate myself because I am not or were not able to do anything; like, I do not even want to continue to this article, I just feel low and do not want to type things on the keyboard... You got the point; this event was just an example, and the fact that I have much more things going on on my life right now; I am not suicidal, but I will not hesitate if I get a chance to end myself too... No matter if or how you just want to reach out, I will both answer to all of your comments and DM's; please do not hesitate to ask such things, they can be related to anything, I would love to answer your questions and clean up those question marks; and also, please do not also hesitate to share your thoughts, completely... My only wish is, just do not be too offensive; thanks. The world is a bad, disgusting, and a hateful place; I want to end myself just because of this...",0
Pls i need help. I cannot take it no more Counseling,0
"Back story how I got to where I am. I am 20F and I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Everything was going great until I got depressed again. I could take care of myself properly, could not get myself motivated to do anything, slept in later than I should. And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work. For some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that I am scared of or have a hard time doing, I just shut down completely. I agree I was pretty terrible to live with. Some days I helped out so much around the house and other days I could not get myself to do anything at all. I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (I would not do that). Flash forward to three weeks ago: everything got worse, we started fighting constantly. He told me I should have tried harder and he was right. He said it was killing him to see me like this. He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However, we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. Took him a bit to realized that I was not just trying to get him to let me stay and I needed help with it. He told me if I start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but I feel lost. My parents are so mad at me because I failed my relationship. They because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way I told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened. I just need someone to listen and encourage me to do better.",0
"I used to be very passionate about helping people. I had so much optimism and good will in me, knowing that I am not an expert I still hoped that I could cheer people up. I remeber trying to put words together so they would not sound cheesy but also be understanding. Sometimes you do not know what to say. What could you anwser to a question like ""what is the point of it all if we are going to die anyway?""? At first, you get stunned. But then you say that life has it is good sides and bad times make us appreciate them more amd we should use the one shot we have at life. I remember giving such anwsers almost automatically, without really thinking about it. It seemed obvious, right?&amp;#x200B;Flashback to now, I had a suicide attempt 3 months ago and got stuck in a psych ward for a while. I got out by not speaking about my thoughts, I guess doctors thought that if I do not talk about something, I do not think about it. But to be honest, suicide never left my mind. I think about it every day. I want it. I crave it&amp;#x200B;I got results of my end of high school exams. I did very well, far better than I anticipated. The moment I saw the results I realised I hoped they would be awful. That way I would have an excuse and more bravery to end it all I am not sure why I am writing this here. To be honest, attempts at trying to comfort make me sick. I feel like puking every time I see another ""You matter "". Even those of you with the best intentions will be able to write a comment like ""I know it is hard, it will be better. Blah blah blah"" which will make me roll my eyes. Even if someone means well, how can you not get annoyed hearing the same things over and over?&amp;#x200B;In a week I am going to another psych ward. I have exactly 0 faith in it. I have been going to therapy since I was 4, my number of therapists has entered double digits. Truth be told, therapists do not have any magical recepies for fixing you. You hear from them the exactly same bullshit you would see if you googled ""motivational quotes for depressed people""&amp;#x200B;I guess the only reason why I am writing this is because I cannot really talk about it to my friends. they would mean well and tell me the same things as everyone but I really do not want them to see the type of anger those cheesy lines invoke in me. Tonight I will probably tie and untie nooses out of boredom whishing I had enough courage to try again&amp;#x200B;If for some crazy reason any masochist will decide to comment on that post, I am sorry in advance. I will be very angry and irritated because everything you can say I have heard millions of times. you are better off spending your energy on someone else I used to be a supporter like you guys. it is a lie though",1
(excuse my bad English)Since my 14yo I search a painless death. I know my place is not on earth and I just do not want to live. I have tested many things and it did not work. I would like someone to give me a good way to kill myself without pain.Thank you in advance. 5 Long years,1
Want to hang myself but cannot afford to go buy rope(looks suspicious and kind of expensive). What can I find at home that will work? Thank you in advanced. What can be used for hanging?,1
"Idk where to start haha... I just know that if I do not vent I am going to go insane... I am uhm... I am holding back tears right now and my anxiety is at peak levels so I feel like I am going to puke... I just... God these last few months were so much better for me... I thought I was getting better... I was not constantly flitting between being a numb robot which calmly enjoyed thinking of killing itself and a girl who was always on the verge of tears, always anxious and scared shitless of her own thoughts... That was fucking terrible and I... I cannot make it through that again... These last few days... With my dad leaving on a trip and leaving me in charge of mom, who is going through an episode rn (she has BPD)... And my brother who is older to me but just... does not help... I am still recovering... I am not nearly as strong as I used to be... Idk if I can take it... Handling mum in her episode all alone I mean... And my fear and anxiety is only made worse by the fact that everyone is on edge about this trip of dad's and they are taking it out on me... My dad telling me that I am useless (while also saying things like I am the only reason he can leave) and just making me feel like shit about myself... Like I am not doing enough... I am trying so hard... I swear I am... I am giving it my all... But rn? I cannot do shit like studying... All of my energy is going in pretending that I am not fucking losing it or fine with this whole situation... So when I am not doing things for them I am playing minecraft... Something I find fun and relaxing and therapeutic almost... Just... Whatever! I know it is a fucking waste of time but really dad? Now? You want to tell me that I am wasting time and I will regret it now? When I am already feeling like shit about myself and you know it? Not cool... Fucking give me a break! I am not the perfect daughter you wanted...I am sorry... I just cannot be that... I mean... Who tells their kid who is A) just coming out of depression, B) just expressing her feelings, C) literally is coming out of depression solely because she followed her therapist's advice to express her feelings instead of bottling them up, that she is not allowed to show anger or be upset? Who does that?I wish I was fucking kidding but dad said that... Because it might upset mum... God forbid mum sheds a tear! Me? Pshhh let me cry rivers... Who fucking cares? Oh silently smothering myself with a pillow so no one can hear me cry of course... God forbid MOM hears me and gets upset... Now if you will excuse me... Imma do just that... Go smother myself with a pillow and cry myself to sleep... If you made it this far... Thank you for listening... Seriously... I... I needed to be heard for once... I do not want to go back there again... Please god no... I do not think I will survive...",0

"Now no one love me and need me. it is all my fault, I always mad, lazy and being an asshole to everyone. The last person that love me is now hating on me after a fight. Now I am unloved and I deserve it, I should never exist in this world. Worth it",1
"9 months ago, I very suddenly got depressive symptoms. Id been struggling with anxiety before that and was in therapy for that reason. Depression hit me like a brick in the face and I started to share thoughts of suicide to my friends and therapist. I was involuntarily hospitalized after I cut myself in public. From there it stayed bad.While I could avoid the psych ward within the last 9 months except for that one time, I have scars all over my body, especially my leg, from cutting myself. They are itchy, horrible and so fucking ugly.I do not think I have spent a week without an episode in the last 9 months, no week without thoughts about killing myself. I have friends, a therapist, Ill be put on medication. there is a boy and if I can trust him, he likes me just as much as I like him and we may have a future. Things are objectively getting better compared to when all of this started, I was lonely and being emotionally abused by a friend. But I have lost trust in all of this. In my head, I cannot get better. I cannot believe I am loved even though I kind of know I am, logically.I constantly still think of killing myself and today is one of those days. The thoughts do not stop even though life is getting better",1
I am really fuckin sad I am in this summer term for college and I cannot control myself or anything around me I feel like I am worthless I do not have any friends I try to open up to people but I just cannot I am struggling like never before,0
I am not talking necessarily to the suicidal people here but to everyone rhetorically I am tired of the it gets better and you are loved fucking horseshitIt does not get better. No one loves me. No one even wants to talk to me or be around me or be my friend. No one will ever desire me romantically or sexually. It does not ever get better unless you are wealthy or outstandingly good looking. Ever Can we just stop fucking lying to people? I have tried to kill myself 4 times this past year. It did not get better. I have wanted to kill myself since i was in high school. It did not get better. Life is not beautiful. Life is not a gift. Life is NOT worth living. Life is NOT valuable or precious or important. It is never worth living unless you live in extreme comfort and have meaningful people and things to live for. Can we all please fucking admit life is not worth living?,1
i cannot take it anymore I am planning to write my suicide note please i need someone to talk to,1

How come I have to speak in a positive tone when I am feeling like this. How come when I say something in a negative tone, its my fault and I am the bad guy. Why cannot people respect my space. When I say leave me alone, my family demonizes me. I used to be bubbly, optimistic, and outgoing. Now I hate the world and see life for what it isa big waste of time and were only here because of biological purposes. To survive so we can fuck and produce more offspring so that our genes can thrive. there is nothing deep about it, no bigger picture. God fuck I wish I had the guts to kill myself but I do not.

"I am tired of the ""ups"" and crippling ""downs""(I would not say ups, more doing things that distract me long enough to not feel bad). Nothing makes me happy long term. Whenever things that do make me ""happy"" happen, like conventions, ALWAYs lead to a nose dive of depression afterwards.I understand that that is life. That all good things mush come to end. But that is exacly the point. There was a quote from a show that I will never forget, It goes: ""that is exactly it, are the best parts of life just finding momentary distractions to keep yourself busy so you do not think about the harsh reality of life for a second? I can ride roller coasters, meet new friends, and spend time with my family all day long. it is does not change the fact [that]... all of this was for nothing.""I cannot watch anime and avoid most of favorite shows anymore. I see a world full of real adventure and. Not just what people think as adventure in real life. They have a quest, and objective, something that no one else has ever done. The MCs have friends who actually care about them. I cannot make any friends because of my Paranoid Personality Disorder. NO matter how hard I try I just cannot make any new friends. I have tried therapy but nothing has helped. I do not want to touch meds anymore because I have tried them and they made me feel worst. No matter how hard I try I just cannot make any new friends. I do not want to live the rest of my life being this alone. I crave people to hangout with but my PPD is so crippling.Even beyond all my mental illness, I just do not see a future economy I want to be a part of. I do not want to have to constantly be burnt out just to barley survive. Everywhere I look, I see young people totally drained. What kind of life is that?The fact that 78% of people live paycheck to paycheck, cannot have savings, half of college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, I just do not want to live like that.So, to that end, I have made ultimatum. I have just 2 years. If nothing improves I am going to die. But before I do there are something is that I want to do before I go. I have already started putting together a death playlist. Songs I want to listen to before I go. I have already thought about my suicide note I am going to write. I have a list of people that I am going to write them too. Many would say that life is worth living, and that you will never know what the future holds, but, honesty, if you do the same thing from different approaches and nothing changes, you really do not have a reason to hope. ""But if you die,then all that you will know is a painful life"" Not really, because I will be dead. As far as I know, there is not an afterlife. You just die. I have given myself an ultimatum. 2 years. If nothing improves I am going to die. Maybe life just is not for me.",1
"I do not know if this is the right place for this.I just feel sad a lot, the only time I am not sad is when I am with friends, but as soon as that is gone its like a switch and I am sad again.I want to feel justified for having all these sad feelings and I do not want to get up, when I have all these good things around me. So sometimes I want bad things to happen to me like I just wish something bad could happen so I could feel justified, and wanting bad things to happen makes me feel like attention whore.I just feel like I have it much better off than most and I am selfish for feeling sad all the time I just wish I could just appreciate what good things I have but I cannot and I do not know why.I am really sorry this is probably all over the place and does not make sense. Why am I sad when everything is good?",0

"Mainly saying that statement in regards to people like parents and other loved ones who are supposed to care more than anyone else does and who all too frequently cares less than anyone else does (that is how it was for me at least). If people are not truly caring about how you feel, and most people in the world truly do not care about anyone but themselves, find somewhere else you can open up at and consider helping others to do the same. Opening up on the internet is the only thing that helps me to feel better, opening up to friends and family never helped me out at all. I am alone but people on the internet have been helping me to feel less alone and I appreciate that a lot. I cut myself a lot and I am not embarrassed about it or ashamed of it. It helps me to feel less suicidal, and its the only thing that does that for me. I leave my cuts and scars out in the open for all to see. I do not hide it anymore. I want to traumatize everyone with the realization of how much they truly do not care. Most people are basically just happy to watch people they act like they care about suffer and die and I want them all to remember that the rest of their lives. Not all people are like this, but most are. Maybe after they realize how much they truly do not care at all they will learn how to actually care for once and try to save someone is life. Maybe people would not get so desperately suicidal if people actually cared more...",1
Every time I start enjoying life or thinks seem okay something happens and fucks everything up and leaves me back to be extremely depressed. Wtf why cannot life leave me alone and let me be happy for once is that too much to fucking ask for Let me be happy for once,0

"Post-partum depression for the second time. I barely survived it with my first. there is definitely no time to sleep or take proper care of myself with a two year old and a newborn. I used to think that needing to stick around for my kids would keep me from killing myself, but I am starting to feel like literally anyone else could do a better job than me, so yesterday after a particularly bad night of lots of inconsolable screaming and crying from my newborn and no sleeping (do not know how many nights in a row that makes), I started to make a plan. Looking for the best way to go peacefully and quickly. I want to shut my brain off. I just need some quiet. I just need some rest. Mom of 2",1

I just suffer everyday and I cannot fake that I do not suffer anymore. Sorry for everyone who I ruined lives and that is it. But it is fine, I will not be a jester for you anymore and you will be free from the burden I am. Goodbye. I will kill myself soon",1
"I am getting old now and realizing I have had dead spot decades in my lifetime. Memories of depression starting from age 5. Parent accounts of ND sensitivities before age 5.From age 10-20, dead spot, 0 productivity Then some brightness and progress from 20-30.Then again, 0 productivity from 30-40. I am starting to see some brightness again now. I hope it lasts.Are these decade-long cycles common among people with depression? I am not asking for a diagnosis of course but I am curious is this pattern consistent with a different diagnosis besides depression? I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I am on medication for that and I have been on anti-anxiety meds before but not currently taking any now. I need to go back to a psychiatrist for further evaluations I just have not made appointments because the whole process feels invasive and kind of exhausting but I will. Are Lifetime Cycles Common?",0
"I think its time for me to say my final goodbyes to this Earth. There is so much boiling hate with the people I left and the people that have left me. It was all worthless since the day that I came to this hell they call Earth. Nobody can save me because I am impossible to save. do not even bother saying that is its all going to get better. The void inside that I have does not get filled, but gets even bigger everyday that I wake up to this fucking pain. I went through so many suicide attempts and I think I do not regret every single one. I do not want to know about what is going happen next with my goddamn life. Every fucking voice in my head is always telling me to die a fast death. I think I have reached the point where there is nothing else to discover. I said I was going to kill myself pretty soon so I think this the way my life is going to end. Thanks for 18 miserable fucking years. I think I fucking had it with all the bullshit. There is no goddamn reason for me to live another day.",1

please check my last post (linked in comments) for context I am going to kill myself tonight,1
"Sometimes I just want to give up. The reason why will sound so petty and hilarious to you, ha ha. I am a 24 year old man. I am a virgin. this is a problem for me, not because I am desperate for an orgasm upgrade (my right hand does a decent enough job), but because I want validation that I am worth someone is time and that they will get that close to me. I want to love someone and know them intimately and vise versa. I do not think people who have had a partner actually understand this. they are always like ""its just sex"". Uh, no, for me, its a symbol of acceptance into humanity, a symbol of love and acceptance. Sure my mom loves me. She has to. The trick is to convince a total stranger that you are worth something. In my eyes, I am a loser and pathetic. I cannot tell you how painful that is. And to get to the point, I feel like I will take so long to recover. I have allot on my plate. A court case, drug addictions, social isolation, depression, unemployment, a bunch of nasty scars that are obviously self-inflicted, learning disabilities. Need I mention, a brain that is fantastic at compiling excuses. I feel like a disgusting and unnatractive wretch. I am sure you can understand that from what I listed. But also, please understand that I am desperate to reach out and have someone tell me I am worth spending time with. At my lowest most loserish point, I have become more desperate for affection than I have ever been in my life. Shit luck, that is. And I cannot help but think I will be into my thirties by the time I have ""focused on myself"" long enough to fuck. And then? Well, Ill get to fuck ugly thirty year olds. There it is, there is the petty point I have been tryuing to get to this whole time. To be honest, I like to look at 18-22 year olds, young people, that is who I am attracted to. And I have squandered my opportunities to be with those people. And I am never going to be bezos and be able to pay for peoples affection, adn I do not think I am going to look like arnold schwarznegger either. So I have missed out. Also I am drunk right now. Sour grapes",0
"Ever since the summer solstice, I have had this heavy feeling of dread that the days were growing shorter and eventually they would just stop. I have a lot going on in my life right now with divorce, retirement from one job and transitioning to who knows what else, my children live on the opposite side of the country during the school year(of no fault of my own), My health has gotten progressively worse due to my own lack of motivation and it feels like I am telling the story of the end of my life. When the days began to become longer, I felt a little bit of hope, or at least something I can look forward to. Now, it just feels like my life is ending and there is nothing I can do about it. Can anyone feel the days grow in shorter?",0
"Very soon I am going to have about 2 hours alone to myself. I think that is as good a time as any to die. I need to stop procrastinating and crying wolf every time I want to die. Now its time to act. I guess this would be goodbye I might die today, if I get the courage",1
"Pretty basic post. I just wanted to vent and know if there was anything I could possibly do to talk myself off the edge this time.I am 16, just turned this past May, yeah I know my post history says I have been 16 for longer but whatever, I am tired of keeping up with all my online ages. I am currently away from my house, staying with my aunt and uncle in North Carolina. I thought this trip would make me feel better, but it has not, and it is made it substantially worse. there is guns everywhere. I am constantly misgendered (I know it is annoying to hear that word, believe me I hate it too, but it is been taking a pretty big toll.) I feel horrifically guilty for existing around these people and making them uncomfortable by looking and acting masculine. They expected a girl, not some hairy weirdo that looks like it is going to break down and cry everytime you call it a girl. I just want to hide and act like I do not exist, I want to go to a place where no one has to indulge my make-pretend fantasy but me. I want the constant buzz of thought in my mind to go away. I want my mom to get the attention she wants from my death and finally stop villianizing me.I try to visualize my future and all I see is pity and rejection, constant pain from my past, and more than likely a few addictions to boot. I see no woman or man truly loving me, maybe a pity date once and a while. I know that I will never have enough money to get surgery or go on t, I know that I will most likely age out of highschool and barely be able to land a job that I will miserably work at for twenty years.I just want to take myself out before I have the displeasure of experiencing what my adult life will be like. I have no friends, I have distanced myself from all of them. I have no siblings. Most of my outer family is dead. I do not talk to my mom's side. My Dad will most likely die before he hits 45. My Mom will not care, it is not like I was making honor roll anyway and now she has another excuse to bitch and whine.I am done. I am barely 16 and I am done. I am so tired of suffering. Being trans is horrible and I am ready to add to the statistics.",1
"Unfazed. Unbothered.There was something bothering me, but now that I got it off my chest, instead of feeling better, I feel nothing.I do not even feel like listening to music and having a breakdown, like I have been doing for the past 5 or so days. I do not feel like killing myself either. I just feel... nothing.And I hate it I hate it so bad. For as long as I felt pain, at least I felt something. But now it is all gone. I am gone. I am back to being the boring she will of a person I once was, and I hate it. I feel empty.",0
"I do not know how can we overcome this parasite that is called depression and anxiety! Its killing us. I am so fucking tired of being like this. I want to live happily, enjoy life, and make something with it.I am tired of thinking that its over and then all of a sudden it hits back even stronger.I am tired of being alone, yes tired of being alone with no one that cares about me. Tired of being alone with my thoughts that will not stop until i kill my self.I am just tired. I think I am done with all of this shit.",0

I am just trying to be authenticate and real with myself.i can still get degrees. i can continue running long distances and probably break a few records. i can still climb. i can still ski. none of it really seems to matter to me anymore.i can sell all of my assets and drain my bank account and just enjoy the rest of life with what i have.for the last few months, i just want to die. it is a constant struggle. i feel bad thinking about it. i feel bad talking about it. it is exhausting. there is no relief.i have no will to live. i have zero hope. i keep crying.i keep repeating these same thoughts all of the time. no relief",0

"I hate my thoughts because they are intrusive, depressing, loud, and give me headaches so I listen to music to drown them out, up until recently I was told this was not normal.

"So since my last post of honestly wanting to die. My life has somehow actually gotten worse...? Go figure... I thought, for the sake of the love of my life, maybe I should pull my ass from the ground and really try to do something more for my life. I am still on the path to losing weight, I am slowly getting healthier, I am on the right track for medications, I applied for another job thinking maybe now the covid (for the most part) is dying. I could finally return to work. I could pay my debts, save up, buy a travel trailer for now, and a vehicle to tow it. I am 22 without a drivers license... I am 22 and I do not own a car. I am 22 and I cannot even pay a simple phone bill. I am 22 and I can barley afford to feed myself even with stamps, I cannot afford the special diet for my medical needs. I am 22 and I cannot hold a job. I am 22 and I am relying on the state because my family is basically dead to me and I to them. I am 22 with next to no friends. I am 22 and I do not think I cannot really trust anyone else ever. I am 22 and I am pathetic. I am 22 and I have longed for death for so long. I am 22 and I should have been dead before 18 according to doctors when I was a child. I am 22. I made it past all the odds I was given, I did not get pregnant at 20 like the last few generations of my family. I am 22 and I am a failure. I cannot stop thinking about it, I cannot stop longing for it. I am 22. Why am I in this much pain? Why do I deserve this? I try to better my life... I try so hard to no avail at ALL. I grew up severely abused and neglected, I kept pushing and pushing, I had no help, its never been easy, I have basically been on my own since a very young age, I took care of all my younger siblings because my parents are incapable entirely. I was the mother. The caretaker. I did it all. I cleaned an entire house pretty much daily. I cooked all the meals. While juggling public school, state enforced therapy and a bunch of other shit. I have never had a stable situation I could spit toward. But then. I met someone. I love him so much, the first person to really treat me like a human instead of a tool, someone who really just wanted to get to know me, let me express my emotions. Someone who tried their best to offer me the stability I craved my entire life. But now I have fuked that up too... I got my job, I managed to nearly break my foot and got fired after one day of training. Which lead my depression down again, so I stopped taking as much care of myself. Now. Half way through my doctor advised healing. I am being asked to leave, not by the person but another, who owns the house, so I must abide. I am 22. I am on the street. I cannot get a job and I have no real place to sleep. I am pretty much way past the point of dead inside. I really am a useless and worthless piece of shit. I did my best, I had a bit of stability for once. Now I cannot live without having that again. I am done this time. I have been homeless so much because of my shit family, and got used by toxic friends to just have a place to sleep. I tried to change my life. I needed a little more time. there is something really wrong with me and I am never going to get the help I need. No one wants to be around me, is not that clear from how many times I have been asked to leave? Yet no ones going to give me a reason or tell me what I did and I cannot figure it out. This is hell. I want to change and be better, because clearly something is wrong with me. But I do not know how... I cannot do this again.. I am homeless again and I am twenty fucking two. I am worthless. A waste of time and space. I am useless. I mean nothing. No one is going to actually care until I am gone. No one is going to really miss me. I cannot get these thoughts to go away, they have been so present since March my last post. I did not kill myself when I planned to because I got the job, things looked up for such a short time. Now not only am I back to square one, I have taken several steps back from that. I am way fucking worse. My fear of instabilty has grown to new unbearable heights. I am confident I will never been able to live somewhere and not get fucked over. Like that is legit it. I. Am. Done. I want to die, I do not want to do this again, it will never get better and if it does for a few months? A year? Then what? I just prolonged this shit again. I cannot take itIm done this time I am over my lifeI cannot do this anymore. I am 22I have nothing to my name, I cannot even stand on my own two feet (quite literally) I will never get help, I will never be fixed, idfk what is wrong with me I cannot handle this anymore I am so scared and I feel so alone. I want to cry till my eyes bleed. I want this world to make sense. I feel like I am a break in the code. A mistake. I do not belong here. I never will. I should not be of this world. I am not made for it. I am too scared a mental hospital will fuck me like they did as a child, beyond that where do I go when I get out? I am homeless again.. maybe I should just rot there? I do not know I do not know what to doIm lostIm scaredIm helplessI want to change my life yet every chance I try for gets taken away from me.I am undeserving of kindness, just like my family taught meI am undeserving of love I am undeserving of time or space I do not want anyone to waste their energy on meI don want to be thought of I do not want to be spoken about I want to disappear Its not even that I want to dieI just do not want to live like thisI do not want to struggle like this I want to be far away from all you humans.Yet that can never happen. Humanity is cruel Death is my only option I am 22.... I am 22 and its just worse",1
"I feel like I have tried everything.I am 22, I have a wonderful 8 month old daughter, I completed my Bachelors degree in 2 years, I work at my dream job in a level one trauma center as a Trauma RN, I own my own home and paid off vehicle. I am fairly healthy, I gained some weight during my pregnancy but before and even the past 2 months I eat pretty well, count macros, workout 4-6 days a week. I have tried so many medications, therapies, psychiatrists, psychologists. They all say I am improving but in reality I just shut down every time I go. I am tired of feeling the same way day in and day out and hearing the same crap. I feel like I do not get anything helpful that actually changes my life. I do not have many close friends or people that I enjoy being around, I feel exhausted after my days of working or having lunch with a friend that may only even last an hour. I have tried the ""fake it 'till you make it"" bull crap, positive mindset, yoga, everything. I feel like my mind is a black cloud that chokes out every happy moment or thought.I kept telling myself when I was in middle and high school that this would be it, when I finally achieved what I wanted to and had my dream life maybe I could get stable ground and not feel like I am running away from my own thoughts 24/7. I am sick of being depressed. It is robbing me of my life. My daughter is 8 months and I cannot help but cry every time I think too much about it, I feel bad because half of the time all I can do it put on a show for her and scroll through my phone or sleep.

"Been dealing with depression for a few years and although I have gotten better when comparing myself now and me from a couple years ago, I still feel hopeless about myself.Had a long term relationship that ended two years ago and I still suffer about it daily. I feel like I will end alone.Got no clue about what path to take professionally and even though I am working, it is outside my field and I am absolutely exhausted with the second university course I am doing currently.I just feel like whatever I do and no matter how hard I try, it is never enough. Not enough to get over my ex, not enough to find someone nice and actually trust people again, not enough to find myself professionally and not enough to get myself better, away from the pit of dispair that I was back then.I know I am a bit better, but I am exhausted and frustrated. do not know how to feel at peace anymore and it does not feel like it will charge any time soon. I know a new relationship is not the answer for my problems, but damn, I miss not feeling alone, I miss taking care of someone and feeling cared for.I am just rambling at this point but those are the feelings I have every day, and no matter how hard I try to see things differently and to reinvent myself, it never seems like it is enough.

"college applications may be one of the stupidest reasons to commit over, but I have no other options. it hit me today that i either do it now or later, after the schools reject me, so why wait i guess. besides, i cannot say I have ever really seen myself living past 18 anyways. the only drawback is that the method is not instantaneous, but i do not envision myself backing out this time. this subreddits helped me feel less alone these past few months, but it is not enough anymore. take care guys college apps suck",1

"As the title suggests I had planned to kill myself last night. Precisely the plan was to electrocute myself as it does not really require a lot of prep. I will not go into details about the specific act due to the fear someone might attempt to recreate it. Anyways, that would have been my second suicide attempt, the first one being about a year and a half ago with me stabbing myself in the neck a few times. Not the most elegant suicide method I admit but I was not looking for something elegant at the time. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) about 3 years ago, changed a few therapists and medications but nothing helped enough. It just feels like life has just been postponing suicide since my first attempt. On the bright side, I have not self-harmed since then but hell do I want to sometimes. In every bridge, every speeding car, every kitchen knife, every rope, every policeman even all I see is a way to death. The main question that people might have from the title - Did I go through with it? No. Why? I do not know really, instead, I went for a run (which is usually a temporary mood boost for me but it goes away quite quickly) and then I was too tired to do it. Do I still want to do it? Yes, yes and yes. I only stopped myself today too because a friend of mine has her birthday today and I do not want to ruin it even if we are not really close. it is just all postponing but I am not sure until when. Anyways, thanks for your time, hope you are doing better! I had a suicide attempt planned for last night.",1

"I got prescribed to months worth of Lexapro (and to take half a tablet a day) right before my insurance expired (they were trying to get me enough lexapro to last me until I find new insurance). That was two months ago and I have been afraid of taking it since.I smoke weed on the daily because it helps calm my nerves for like 30 minutes so I could work on my writing and get in the zone. However, in the past week I have been incredibly depressed and the upcoming death of my cat I fear will make that 10x worse (it already is).Is it worth taking Lexapro or do you think it will kill my creativity? I can be creative without weed, its just a small jumpstart. I am more scared of losing it to the lexapro but I am also scared of my lack of motivation, energy, and depression. I am trying to work on changing my lifestyle but its been years, and though I had a good 3-week period w/o depression after getting the pills (aka I did not have any anymore) I was back to square one and its been getting worse since.

I go to work everyday from 3 PM to midnight. it is been sapping all of my time and energy. The drainage and time taken away from me is making me believe that this life is ultimately pointless. I am attending university and I am a part of a fraternity, but I am scared to reach out to any of my brothers about my suicidal thoughts, mainly because I do not want them to think of me as someone who ""just does not want to go to work"". this is seriously hurting me, I am really scared.

So on top of everything I am going through my transmission is shot. And the guy I am staying with is kicking me out because I cannot make it to work(which is an hour and a half away) so now probably going to lose my job. I am broke. Homeless. Without a car.

"I am having this overwhelming feeling lately that I am not right. I feel like the longer I go on the more broken I get. I feel like I am missing pieces, I do not know how to describe it properly. It almost feels horrific, the only way I can put it is like I have had a whole bunch of body parts amputated over the years and I feel irreversibly disfigured. But mentally. And not all at once, but gradually over time. Like one day I might wake up and look down to see my leg is gone or my hand is missing fingers. It makes me feel sick. Its like body horror but only I can see it or feel it. I will never be the same again and the further I go on the more mutilated it get. It feels like something puts me on a surgical table and injects me with a sedative so I cannot move, but I can still see and still feel it and then it straps me down and takes pieces of me and then throws me back out into the world to figure out how to come to terms with my new disfigurements. Its horrific but I am too numb and tired to scream or react. Its like a waking nightmare and no one can see it but me.I cannot explain it properly. But I am trapped in this feeling and I am silently horrified. But I am also tired. I just want to lay down and rest but the parts of me that allowed me to rest are gone now too, like having my eyelids removed. So I just have to shamble onwards, feeling like I am trapped in some Saw-inspired gauntlet losing piece after piece of myself to the grotesque traps to the point where I am not even sure I want to get out because I have been so irreversibly mutilated. I feel broken beyond repair",0

Getting a favourable result is the only way I can stay alive, staying alive/functional is the only way I can get a favourable result. I should be in a mental hospital. This is the only way through. I am not in control of my own medical decisions. I am not capable of dealing with this rage. I am fucking drowning and it gets worse everyday. My problem is existential but it is not being treated as such. Where the fuck do I put this rage. I am stronger and weaker than everyone my age.

I do not like her. not because I am being petty - but she made fun of the shit I am interested in. so much so that it send me into another depressive episode or whatever. I am not even sure if that is what these things are.i find no interest in the game I have recently been playing. like all of a sudden an off switch went in my brain and made me lose my love for it. all i want to do is sleep but i feel too restless to do so. death terrifies me. i pretend it does not but as soon as i think about the method to killing myself i tear up. shit sucks. what stings most is that i know i have it good - my teacher even poked fun at me for it , lol. i just hate what i feel a lot of the time.i wonder if I will ever get the balls to chug down a bunch of my mothers blood pressure tablets - she mentioned once that if i took them I would have a heart attack.I have decided going by train is too scary. the way i decided that is by my friend shaming me about the fact i wanted a more gruesome method.I only ever wanted something more clean cut and gruesome because i heard once that, while women try to kill themselves more than men, men have a higher death rate because men usually choose shooting themselves in the head rather than an overdose.I am in my bedroom right now - listening to the birds. I would say I am calm but i feel like I am on the verge of fucking tears. i hate crying. i never feel better after crying. venting a few thoughts again",1

"I think I am going to finally find peace next month. I have been consumed by suicidal ideation for about a decade now (and have one near-successful attempt + months-long hospital stint under my belt), and the only reason I have not succumbed to it once again is my fucked up family dynamic.My mom died nine years ago and since then my family has been non-existent. Its just myself, a sister I talk to once a year, and my twin brother I cannot/do not confide in. My dad broke when my mom died, and hes now grappling with the early stages of Alzheimers. He is essentially a pet I check in on now. Hes never been an emotionally supportive parent, so when my mom died, my siblings and I were left to grieve on our own. We were left to wrap up our childhoods in mourning, and enter adulthood without support of guidance. Despite this and the total lack of emotional support, my dad truly is the kindest man I know, so accepting and admitting to myself that hes been a useless father has been a difficult process. I feel guilty every time I feel frustrated or resentful of him. I feel angry because hes the one thing blocking my path to easy, permanent pain relief. I do not have family to lean on. I do not have any friends I am comfortable confiding in. I simply want to die, but doing so will fuck my siblings up, and my dad will have no one to regularly check in on him. Lately, I have been feeling less and less restrained by all this though. Like my family will eventually be fine, and on some level they will understand the humane aspect of self-euthanization. I do not know. I am consumed by the desire to self-euthanize, and I do not think I can restrain myself much longer.",1
"About 3 months ago I finally decided to go to the doctor by reccomendation of my relative after another heavy depressive episode. It was just one visit, and after that I stopped going because of workload at my university I felt I could not keep up. I know I should not expect miracles after one visit, but even this one felt so incredibly hard, I did not know how to describe my feelings, why I wanted to die or should I even share too much details of my life. I was also prescribed antidepressants for a month but i do not think it helped. Now I am at rock bottom again and want to start my visits again, but I do not know, I am afraid I am just helpless and I am stuck being miserable for life. And the guilt that these visits are being paid from my parents' pockets does not help... I want to get help but afraid it will not do anything",1

To me it seems like something everyone struggles with sometimes. I know it is a serious thing but I just do not understand why it is not normal. Is it possible to not think about suicide sometimes? I think about it often last year I thought about it every day. I had a pill bottle in my closet I had a plan but I knew I would never do it because it is too scary I am afraid it will hurt and that I will fail the attempt. No one ever knew because it feels stupid to tell someone I have the thoughts but I am not actually going to do it I just think about it. If a few years ago someone told me they were suicidal I would have been shocked and kind of scared but if someone tells me now it is just a normal thing to me. It see it as something normal that happens to everyone. Like having a bad day everyone has bad days sometimes. But I have those thoughts too so I should understand that it is a very serious thing but I do not Are suicidal thoughts normal,1

"For the most part of my life I have been depressed. My brother is getting married,graduating from college with flying colors and my sister is starting to graduate from college now. Tried getting into it but suffered from such deep depression that I could not continue with college and had to drop out Had multiple mental breakdowns, in my twenties and still leaving with may parents barely getting starting on anything. Dad low key called me a failure and wants to see me gone from the house. My mom was supportive but she is starting to get annoyed by me more and more. There was not a day that went by where I thought of ending it all,Had to take such deep antidepressant and actively seemed treatment. And after that I thought I was getting better. Entered another college that I wanted and was proud off being accepted. Started going out more and feeling all around better.genuinely thought things were getting better for me. Than one day I ran out of pills to take due to my insurance. Every single day I would feel worse from before. To the point that I started thinking of suicide again. I thought I was finally happy for once and I was improving myself. Find out that all of those feelings where from the Medication and nothing really much of me changed. I want to be happy but I cannot and I am genuinely sure that those medications were the only thing keeping me alive. I just wanted a happy life for once. Why cannot I feel this way by myself. The idea that the only feeling of enjoyment was not because I was improving but from a pill manipulating me to not feel sad.is this what progress is. I become the disappointment of my family and my life can never feel alright but hurray or me for taking a prescription pill and not ending it all? Is that progress?

"did not really know where to post this but needed somewhere to vent. In the past weeks I have had a lot of unfortunate events unfold, anxiety building, feelings of numbness to emotion. To pile onto everything, a good highschool friend of mine had passed away, I have cried several nights, and spent days completely emotionless, friends and family trying to comfort me are met with dull response and low energy and I hate how I feel right now, I am fully aware this is probably normal but it is really taking its toll on me. Not really sure where I am going with this post but if anyone has had something similar happen to them I would love to hear some comforting words and some strategies I can implement to put myself back onto the road of self improvement.

"Sorry this is long but I have to get it out.I have a dissociation disorder and I struggle with attachment/abandonment issues. A couple years ago I ended up in the youth psych ward. I got discharged and sent to this place called Woods Homes. It was a residential program for youth who have pretty bad mental health issues. Long story short, I got really attached to a couple of the staff there and sometimes they would leave without saying goodbye. That would always break me but I kept going because my favourite staff (J) was still there. When it came time for me to be discharged J informed me that she was also leaving. That broke my heart in a million pieces. me and her did have a decent goodbye but it still hurt just as bad. AnywaysLast weekend was really rough. My mind was spiralling. I was in such an intense physical, emotional, mental pain. I just wanted it to stop.My mind was just going over things that happened at woods (good and bad) over and over and over. My memories are what hurt me. The good ones hurt the most because it makes me realize I am never going to have that again. I am never going to find another J. Never going to see them again.With all this on my mind I wanted to end it. There was not a point to living without them in my life anymore. So I made a plan. I have attempted before but I have never made a plan. At least not a serious, detailed plan. Basically it was death by cop. I have a BB gun that looks exactly like a real gun with no orange tip. My plan was to go to read my confidential files from woods, go to woods, make a scene, have the cops come, Id say what I wanted to then Id point the gun and walk towards them. Bang.That never happened unfortunately. I ended up breaking down and dissociating. I was on autopilot and I ended up picking up my belt and tightening it around my neck. Even if I wanted to, I could not stop it. I was seeing spots and my vision was fading. Then I heard my cat outside my room. His meow pulled me out of my dissociation enough for me to undo the belt. It stayed around my neck for about 45 mins while I laid back and just sobbed. All of that did not change my mind though. I still wanted to bad to die. But I was too exhausted to do anything about it. After all that I smoked a huge dab and went for a walk still dissociated. I was hearing shit all around me, people walking, loud bangs and people yelling. I was seeing little shadow animals running across the road. But it was 4am and I live in a small town where the streets are absolutely dead at night. Just paranoia I guess. I ended up sitting on the sidewalk and dissociated then fell asleep. I got home around 6:15am. It was really a nightmare I was trapped in. The next day I was very physically sick. Just from the exhaustion and all the emotions I was feeling. could not do anything. I reached out to someone I work with at a life skills program and she graciously changed my appointment to monday. I went and saw her and gave her all my writing. After reading it she recommended I go to the hospital. I went to ER and waited for a day and a half before I got transferred to a short stay crisis stabilization unit. that is where I am currently. Its not helpful. I have been doing the work. I have been making an effort. But the staff do not seem to think that my problem is as big as I say it is. Everytime I have gone to the hospital and tell them what is going on the staff always look at me like really? that is it? Okay then its very frustrating. And usually leads to me making a scene on purpose so that they take me seriously. But then that leads to getting restrained and being put in high observation and getting tackled and getting a needle in your ass so you sleep for two days I have been through all this before and it was just as useless then. The problem is.. when I go home I know I am going to go right back into that state and want to carry out my plan. I feel so lost and hopeless. Not sure what to do anymore.Anyways. Thanks for reading. Dissociated and tried to end it",1

I would prefer to keep my identity anonymous but I am at high-school and I was basically a pretty energetic individual until I got hit with the fact that my friends hate me because of a stupid asshole I ended up becoming the quiet nerd not really as I was not working enough at my school work even though I am confident I am an excellent student. 2 years later I ask them again now if we can go out or something and they told me they would see 3 out of 9 people supported me and were able to make that asshole agree to voting which ended up being that I am not a person they would ever invite and my friends did not stand up for me they just rules are rules so I just cut all contact they can have with me which I think does not really matter because they would not give a fuck I have been suffering from social anxiety for many years and now the only thing that I can think of is why am I hated and for how long and I cannot talk to anybody else and now I am just surrounded by no true person I am breaking down and might have suicidal thoughts any advice please? My friends hate me hanging out with them because of some stupid assholes who hang out with them and I cannot take it anymore,0
I woke up today and after feeling slightly better for maybe six months I got a letter in the mail my insurance company is reevaluating my claim for long-term disability. I feel like I just went through their evaluation by other MDs a year ago and now they sent a whole package of information for me and my doctor to complete. I am so tired of life I need to be out of work. I lost my job because of mental and physical health and there is nothing to go back to. How can they do this evaluation again? What if my doctors do not say the correct things on the forms. I am shaking with fear because the only way I am surviving is on disability and I was ready to end my life before they took me out of work. I just cannot do it. I am so tired and afraid. I am shaking with fear and dread. I cannot feel this way again. Insurance Reevaluating My Disability Claim,0
"I am a 22 year old full time single father, her mother does not care to ever see her anymore, I lost my job because I have absolutely NO family to watch my daughter. I have been stuck at home for months terribly behind on bills and finally got an eviction notice a few days ago. 1 year ago I had a happy family in a new home, and there is nothing that would have helped me prepare for the enormous amount of mental toll this has had on me. I have been a sorta chubby guy nearly my entire life, and within 7 months i look disgustingly skinny and unhealthy. I want to die , Every night its a struggle falling asleep with all these thoughts. I have nobody around to tell them to anymore. the good part is, I do not think I would ever actually hurt myself, or so I hope. The love I have for my two year old daughter would never let me leave her alone, and knowing none of my family would ever want to take her.

"I have (m41) been single, lonely and depressed since H.S. never met anyone ""special"". Never been on an actual ""date"". Thought I would try tinder, since my area is a few years behind the technology curve. Those sites/apps are all the same. I have tried them for the last 10 years, and have yet to find anyone even remotely interested.I have been trying to admit for years that it was over. But, hope is a damned thing.It would have been nice, somewhere in the 20 yrs, if someone was even looking/interested.it is hard to accept, when your depression is based off of being lonely/rejected and treated as an outsider (even from ""friends"").

I spend most of my days lately on my futon doing absolutely nothing most of the time. I just stare at the ceiling or cry for hours, waiting and hoping I just die. Everything you care about hurts you eventually because it either dies, changes, or goes away and there is no point of even trying to get attached to anything.

"I do not know how to explain why I am like I am.Starting I was popular trough middle school but always a nice person, suddenly there is high school and in half of 10th grade I start getting bullied, than in 11th grade it become way more frequent and done almost by the whole class because of one of the person So you understand I finished 9th grade with honour and max grade in one of the exams and ended 10th grade with an average of 18/20, but during 11th and 12th grade suddenly I had no friends, I was bullied and people thought it was funny, even I tried to get help from my family but all it did was worsen it. I ended highschool with an avg just enough to join an uni that I wanted but grades way worse than I used to have. Ffw 5 years, I went to uni and made a ""lot"" of friends, have 2 close friend groups and I can speak to random people even if I used to be way more introvert. The problem is for the past 3 years I have been going down a lot mentally, I am really delayed in my uni course, keep disappointing my mother who has to support me alone because my dad never really gave a shit (they are divorced) even if she keeps saying is okay and everyone lives life at their pace and mainly because I am a loser. I feel like I do not deserve the friends I have, I do not deserve my family and I am a virgin at 23, that can make friends with girls but either they never see me romantically or I am just that annoying / ugly. I feel the worse when I am with my friends for a whole night, I feel loved and that people care and like me but suddenly the night ends, they go w their gfs and I am here alone. I do not know why I feel like this and I feel like I am both an impostor in life and in feeling bad, since I keep thinking about just finishing it but do not have the courage to do it and would not want to hurt my closest people specially my mom who has worked 2 jobs and dedicated her life for me. I tried therapy and it did not work, it only gave me more anxiety having stuff to do every new session. Oh and I am delayed in uni because I cannot seem to study properly and when I do I sometimes get panic attacks before exams, I have tried Valium and other medication but it does not work. I just do not know how long I can take it anymore but I feel like I would be a coward for doing it but the pain is just too much.

"I could go on and on about this. But I will keep it brief. To me, i jump from one thing to another.

Now i constantly go back and forth from taking a plunge into binge watching and drowning myself in melancholy. I need to fill myself with something so consuming all the time. If i do not, i crumble into pieces. So it is easy for me to use mobile, because it is easy and accessible and it is normal. what is the cure? what is the fix? Can I go back to being that child addicted to studying? I have an idea on what to do and I am currently doing so much better than how i used to be. But I really need some perspective on how to deal with these tendencies of mine? As in, how to feed it and keep a check on it, at the same time?

"Does anyone else here feel like they will eventually lost their battle with depression? I try to see the beauty in the world but I just cannot seem to find it. I genuinely hate it here and I have zero reason to be depressed which makes me feel even more guilty for feeling so bad. I have a great family and friends who care for me, I have been told I am pretty and I have a good job but none of that seems to matter. I am constantly plagued by the question of what is the meaning of all of this? And why am I here? I have actually looked through pictures of famous people who have ended their own lives so that I do not feel so alone. Succumbing to your own mind",1
"Last week, I made a passive choice to stop fighting. This is not my first time here but, I think this is really going to be it for me. These are my reasons why:1. Nobody would miss meMy family moved out of the country (parents+siblings) and are now permanent residents of another country that I do not have access to (plane ticket prices + covid restrictions + I am a foreigner so I cannot ever just live with them). Its funny, they did not even tell me they were moving until they got their passports renewed two months before. I was just in college and they left me here by myself. So yes, I think I have good reason to believe that my death would not impact the day-to-day life of my immediate family. My old friends and I barely talk. I do not have a job or coworkers. I live with my ex and as soon as I move out, we will be going no contact. So there, nobody would legitimately miss me in any way that is actually meaningful. In fact, I could bet you that I could go a month being dead somewhere and nobody would notice. 2. I am not important. Like I said, I do not have a job. I do not have friends. I do not have a partner. I do not have anything going on in my life. I do not even have pets who depend on me. If anything, because I cannot find work, I can only assume that my skills and education are useless in the current market. I have nothing to offer anybody. 3. I do not want to be here. Id say this is the least important one but if it still matters. If all of the above is true, then what reason do I have to be here if I do not want to be? I have no prospects. My future looks bleak. Id rather control my death if I cannot even control my life. So there. These are my justifications. After I leave this apartment, and my ex no longer expects to hear from me, I will find a peaceful place, away from everybody and say goodbye to this world. I cannot say that its been good but I really did my best. I tried very hard for a long time. I just think that I have nothing to offer to anybody or anything.

My reasons why",1
"I have been trying to tune into how i feel more lately and i cannot stop thinking about one thing in particular - it is usually assumed that suicidal folks are more likely to attempt/commit when they are at the lowest point in their life, and, i mean, it does seem logical. but what I have also noticed is that when I am at my lowest i do not really think about it, and instead i think more about how i wish the pain was over and similar things. but when it gets a little better and when I am back to not doing things on autopilot, that is when i start thinking about it. and it causes kind of a dissonance because i feel better and the situation is better, but at the same time i want to just end it all more than ever. like, for example, I am done with school for the summer, i got a job offer recently, i have not had a flare up in weeks (got a chronic condition), I have made a lot of progress on the book I am currently writing and I have been catching up on a lot of shows and movies - long story short, i have a lot of distractions. but at the same time i feel like absolute shit and every time i go to sleep i hope i do not wake up, and when i do wake up, i think about how much i want this to end.is this how other people feel too? how do you deal with that? usually the go-to advice is to find distractions, but what if distractions \*are\* what is making it worse? when distractions actually make it worse",1
"I do not condone, so please do not do that, but cutting myself and my soon-to-be suicide had made me feel in control again. I was deeply hurt, angry and upset over a thing I did not want to see and hurtful words from a dear person (I knew I was wrong, but seeing how harsh they words were, I realized that I should get rid of myself).So I hurt myself and it felt so fucking good. I could only focus on the physical pain instead of my emotional pain and hurt feelings, the blood coming out of It. Then it came the shame and regret, but still they were better than my original feelings. I can see why people get addicted to it. Anyway, my self harm will not fix the disgrace I am, so all it turns back to killing myself. And I will not give up now.I pretty much want to say sorry to all I hurt, but I doubt people who I hurt will read that. And I am really thankful for the good moments the people I love gave me, but they are just a little ray of sunshine in what could be considered a tempest. I pretty much stopped caring about anything, so I now I have to destroy the fucking failure I am. The only thing that keeps me on is the deep regret of not ending things earlier, especially after losing everything. Goodbye.I just wish I was not an unloveable, worthless freak that hurts people and no ones cares for. For the first time in a long period, I have felt in control again",1
"4 th of July. I am sitting here by myself thinking why tf am I even alive. This is fucking miserable. Go to work, get money, pay your shit to survive, back to work. what is the fucking point ? Hoping something is going to change? It will not. Happiness is an illusion. The only time I have ever felt happy was when I was 6 and my parents got me a sega and when I took molly for the first time. Other than that its just the same fucking shit everyday. Met the love of your life? Guess what, she is/hes either going to either cheat or get tired of you one day. Rare cases when people stay together till they die, but that is because they had no other options. Wait you just won a lottery and hit that 1 mil$? Now everybody wants you for your money and even your family members will try to play you. Life is terrible and we all know that, but we keep pretending its not just because we are too scared to die. The only reason I am not blowing my brains out right now is because I do not want to hurt other people. And I know many of you can relate. Life is pointless",1
"I do not know why I do not have a good reason, maybe its because I am pretty isolated but theoretically things should be looking up for me but I have never felt more like I wanted to hurt and bleed and make stupid dangerous choices.

I am very very tired and I am trapped inside of my own house my own head and the past actions people did to me and I cannot get out of it and I fucking wish I could I want to get out I am feeling so out of it and low",1

I was happy, I had a wonderful partner which I totally fucking destroyed. did not realize how disgusting I was, he wants nothing to do with me and I refuse to live without him. I blew my chances. I am blocked &amp; his family too because after he left I kept harassing him and calling and crying and begging. I even followed him home when I saw him driving because it hurts too much. It has been four months and I cannot change the past. I will end my life. I feel nothing I miss him and I do not like this anymore. I am tired. I do not care about anything or anyone but him. I need a chance to be with him but I do not think its happening. I have failed.",1
"Bare with me guys. I am 22, graduated hs in 2017 and was bulimic in high school. I failed 3+1/2 years of college because of depression that started up my freshman year. I have hidden it from my mom who pays for school w/ the limited $ from parents divorce (because she is extremely reactive so I did not want to tell her &amp; expected the best of me every second because I got good grades in high school). I am just starting over and now she is wondering why I am hiding my grades from her. &amp; I have lied about my grades every since I started failing/was on academic probation in college. I feel like a POS. I do not know what to do. She says if I do not get in a call with a school academic advisor and discuss why I did not get into the state university here WITH HER, she will not be paying for any more school. I am fucking fucked. Long story short, I got my depression handled this last year also but she only knows about the eating disorder. She is NOT the type to be sympathetic about me failing because I had depression, so telling her that is a no. All of the people I know my age have graduated and have degrees w/ a path/future, and I am still here at phase 1, but minus a ton of money. I work for all of my money I have, but my family does not have a lot to spare and my dad does not believe in education &amp; has told me every time I see him that he will never help. Yes, I know I sound ridiculous being sad about wasting money we had for school. Any advice is welcome except for its okay, she will not be mad if you tell her. Depression sucks ass, it directly and indirectly fucks every bit of your life up. Its the reverse Midas touch. Depression in college",0

"If you are reading this then i finally got the courage to end it all i know this is not what you wanted and you may blame yourself but you really should not i believe i was born fucked up and just like how fish give birth to thousands of babies expecting a few to not make it i am just not compatible with the world i have always been a outcast and a waste of the world's resources and i have been waiting to end it all sense middle school being unhappy for so long really fucks you up. And even though I feel upset that this is the way my life went and that I did not get to do the fun things other kids my age are doing, I cannot help but feel happy that I will not have to be a wage slave to continue being miserable until I die of heart disease or cancer. In this part of most suicde notes they write to people who care for them but the only person i have is my dad who is most likely a little bit happy i am gone i mean he is going to be a little sad but over all my death will be a net positive i will not be a burden on him anymore. Today he asked me if i had a plan for getting my driver's license but he kept asking if i have a plan my plan is to take all the mild anxiety meds a friend gave me a then hang my self in the garage i wish i had a less painful way to go out but what is 1 day worth of pain vrs a whole lifetime. I have never been much of a writer but I guess I could rewrite my story here in how I wish it went. I was born randi keene in a small town to 2 happy people who loved eachother very much and would work hard to provide their son the best life his mother would always pack him a school lunch and let him know that she loved him and that his worries were not stupid and that he was not alone. Randi would do well in school and have lots of friends who would care about him and would always have his back on the days he did not feel his best. Randi would never feel like he needed to starve himself or binge on food; he would never have serious thoughts of self harm.Randi would exile in art and theater and would go on to have a fulfilling job in the animation industry working on movies from disney and pixar. Randi would go on to have a successful online presence and would be loved in his circles. He could create anyworld he wished with just his own mind and his artistic talent. One day Randi would meet a wonderful person who would love and support him with the things he loves. They would always try to have a positive outlook on the world and would encourage randi to be his best. They would have a wonderful medieval style wedding. And would not be afraid to express things they like without guilt or shame.Together they would never have to worry about money, they would always have just enough. Their children would become well rounded individuals that always felt loved. Randi would go on to create video games that were well received he would die happy and loved by many he would have a large funeral and people would mourn his death he would be remembered for his kindness and success as an animator. I like the story I made. I know it does not have a lot of struggles but i do not think you need to fight a dragon to have a happy ending.i hope my story comes true next time my note. sorry for spelling errors i am stupid",1
"I used to be happy and had many friends, I used to be the school athlete and people used to look up to me. 2 years ago after drug use at partys since I was 15 (I am 19m) I had a bad reaction and I have not left my house since , I have ghosted everyone and I feel like I have set myself up for failure and thrown away a perfect life if I just never used drugs and stayed with the football team I had been with for 9 years, I think from the reaction I have some kind of of psychosis, I used to be fully sociable but now I feel like I am crippled mentally its horrible sometimes I cannot even watch videos because they trip me out and I do not think I have a way out, Iv trued everything and I have truly fucked myself , idk even know anymore , I have planned my suicide I have 2000 I am ganna set up nitrogen tank with a exit bag hopefully I will not mess up my next life this might be in the next month or 2years but I will not make it past 22 Hello",1

"I have been on a steady decline for a couple months now and I am thinkin I am at my stop. I tried to get better and get help, changed my meds, added meds, but I am all out of juice. I do not have much to live for. I am living alone in my apartment with no job on my 5th year if college. I am in a major I am too late to back out of and hate very much. I have isolated myself from the world and only go outside to get weed or groceries. Otherwise I am playing video games and avoiding my online class and feeling incredibly guilty for not having a job like all my peers. Its anxiety inducing to the point of breakdown to even think about doing interviews. I know, please do not judge me. 98% of my days in the past few months I have had no social interaction whatsoever besides texting my only friend who has now given up on me. She told me i need I need more help than she can give. I get it. But she is been writing off my emotions for a while now anyways so its not surprising I guess. The isolation has killed me. I have lost a lot of ability to socially interact. I know I can be stable. In I highschool I played sports and was friends with half my class. I was able to function and even hold relationships. I am diagnosed bipolar but its ramped up gears 10 fold since freshman year of college. I liked to go birdwatching. I liked to go camping. I liked being around people. I liked playing video games with my friends. Its sad I miss that the most. I still find a little joy in playing team games to get at least a little social interaction. But I have none of that left now thanks to this disease. so what is the point? I do not think there is one anymore. If I kill myself the only ones who would know are my parents who have never supported me emotionally or took mental health seriously. I do not even have anyone to say goodbye to i think I am close to the end",1

"Played an old song ""I do not cry when my dog runs away, I do not get angry at the bills I have to pay.""I did not feel anything, I did not cry, I was locked inside my mind, feeling a cold apathy.""I do not get mad when my mom smokes pot, hits the bottle then goes straight back to the rock.""My mother was a bipolar drug addict, she committed suicide during my childhood. Every time I looked in the mirror I see the she will of another's misery.""Fucking, fighting, it is all the same. Loving come back to me, loving come back to me.""It was all the same, the same, long day of laying around in a depressed haze.I used to listen to that song while I laid in the tub until it became cold. I would have two big plates, four enchiladas, two tubs full of beans, eight tortillas, family meals, bags full bread from various food chains, whatever spoiled thing was in my fridge E.T.C. And I would be eating this way for a long time, going deeper into mental illness, without even seeing it. I would just sit there in cry. did not even know who I was anymore, I had faced derealization that would last for so long I had a difficult time stepping out. Long days, fast years.I was endlessly spinning in a downward spiral.Then I played that song, and I realized how full circle my depression is. I have went through so much since that point, life and depression has changed much, but I have slipped right back into everything I was when I loved this song. Full circle depression",0
I am having a really hard time right now and am about to lose my health insurance so I am scared to even talk to my current doctor about medication again. I am in my late 20s just finished law school and am unemployed but just feel like such a failure. I am not taking the bar until feb I still have some essays I got extended time on and I cannot even bring myself to look at them or think about a job app. All I ever heard from my professors and classmates even when I struggled to turn in simple things was how smart I was and how they wished They got the material like I did but my grades are absolutely terrible further killing myJob prospects. I honestly do not have any friends and do not know how to make any. My partner just started school far away and I cannot even see them and hes been my only support. I am really struggling here and I know eventually things will be ok and get better but I do not know how or when wnd just feel like such a failure all the time. I cannot live up to anything. I just really needed to vent and feel a little less alone right now. Really struggling right now,0
"Long story short I was feeling like relapsing and killing myself so I texted a suicide hotline. I do not enjoy calls at all, to me they are very awkward and uncomfortable so I prefer texting instead. A bot or something like that asked me some questions and I answered, after I finished answering the questions it said someone would be with me soon. Well 20 minutes later I never got another message back, if I had got a message back I probably would not have relapsed :| luckily I never attempted suicide here because I forced myself to take a sleeping pill so I could fall asleep. But what do I do if this happens again?? I messaged a suicide hotline but they never responded",1
Good day everyone I will be returning back to university soon after taking a year off but I do not feel as prepared to handle the academic demands. I have been staying in bed for much of the time and do not feel like doing anything either. I had been diagnosed last year but I never been to therapy or taken any medication for my depression because I was not comfortable doing those things at that time. Now that the new school year is approaching I wanted to ask anyone for advice on how to approach school Especially on how to deal with the heavy workload the stress and depression that comes with it. Thanks Returning back to university,0
"Please let me preface this by saying I am not trying to insult anyone or flex or brag and I am very aware a lot of people are less fortunate than me. I work 3 jobs, 7 days a week, 60 or so hours a week. I pull in. $2400 a month sometimes up to $3000 and have done so for the last year. My monthly expenses come to about $1700 a month and yet I never have more that $300 or so in my account unless I plan on buying something big. Last year it was $1200 on flight sim controls I think I have used like 10 times since I bought them. I have slowly added more pieces to a drum kit I can hardly play, I just rebuilt a new computer two months ago, and last week I bought a 3D printer to make DnD minis. It was not until two days ago when I started looking for a bigger new computer case for my just built rig that I realized that I am just spending money to buy stuff I do not need.I think I am doing this because I constantly feel lonely. No significant other and I do not really socialize outside of work. Does anyone else spend money on expensive things like this? Again sorry if it sounds like I am bragging. Spending money to fill the hole??",0
"Hello. r/depression Expect some incoherence, here. I have had a 40. I will try and cover all the bases: career, love, relationships in general, self-esteem/worth. I will be 40, this year. I am graduating with a worthless Bachelor's in CIS this month. I recently moved to be closer with and provide a home for my daughter who is in the military. My boss loves me, my boss's boss loves me. My daughter loves me. I tried going on BetterHelp but, it is too expensive. I am intelligent, articulate, and charismatic. I am also, probably suffering from CPTSD...maybe...Without a real diagnosis, you have to calculate these things indirectly; kind of like an astronomer measures the distance between stars. So if we measure all the ""giftedness"" I had as a child and compare that to the actual output, setbacks, and emotional outbursts I have had in adulthood we can, maybe, probably say I am guessing the right sport...even if I am not in the ballpark. Anyways, I used to feel something. I used to have euphoria almost everyday. I was working out and eating healthy. I was attractive and I had a sex drive. I felt hopeful and motivated. I had a much stronger sense of self worth pursuing my degree than I feel on the verge of achieving it. The key, back then, was that I had a sense of purpose. I felt that the world wanted me, even needed me and that I would offer up my contribution as a good and kind friend, as a supportive coworker, as a loving and kind mother, as an educated and ""gifted"" woman.I do not feel hope. My dumb ass pursued work in a field that is demand is decreasing. I am alone in a city and state that I abhor. I am too old to seek out friends and I have been alone for so long that I am just fucking weird in public. At least, I feel that way. what is worse is, in spite of feeling sadness, I feel hollow. I am sad because I do not feel the actual sadness. I never understood how people become entitled ""incels""; how they will not just get in the problem and do the emotional work and the physical work to get themselves out of their heads. Well, I think I know why, now. Sometimes, some people do not have access to their creative reasoning. Some people do not have access to their visual mind and literally cannot see a way. Some people cannot access the core emotion that drives them and pushes them to move forward. I have, somehow, become one of those people. I feel owed something for all my years of work. I am creeping ever closer to my sense of insignificance in this world; how plain an lackluster I truly am and I am acting out in stupid, uppity ways. I drink nearly every day. I used to drink occasionally in a year. I want to take up smoking again. Addictions used to scare me but, with the ever increasing sense of doom and hopelessness I have, any dirty spot under a bridge somewhere, homeless and single minded, feels like the right space to be in. Tomorrow, I am going to do a thing that is always worked for me in the past. I am going to make myself suffer. I am going to cut off YouTube, Reddit, and Facebook. I am going to wake up early and exercise and study and read and force the world into slow motion. I am going to let go of the beer and sugar and flood my body with veggies all day. I am going to meditate. I am going to relinquish my idea of who I am and what I am worth and set long term goals but, force myself to have short sight that only encompasses being in this moment doing as much as I possibly can to exceed my own expectations. This used to work. It has worked every single time in the past. I hope I have not squeezed the magic out of it by allowing myself to repeat this cycle. No one owes me anything. I do not owe anybody anything. I am curious to know what I am capable of and what I look like as my very best version of myself; this takes embracing every moment with enthusiasm and without judgement. If I were the best version of myself I would take the energy I use to fight moments I am not comfortable with and use it to express some greatness from within. I should not wish for good days. I should strive to be good to my day. So, now that I have spoken to a bunch of strangers who probably will not read this goddamn mess. I have a sense of how to go about this. Thank you reddit for having this thread. I know I have broken a rule because I have not really asked for anything but, I mean...I kind of just am asking to be witnessed. I think. Would you please be a witness to this terribly painful moment in my life? Feel nothing's worse than feeling misery",0

"A little over 2 years ago I was seeing a girl that would have been the closest to a girlfriend I have ever had. We were both in bad places when we met. She hurt herself, and blamed me. I was at my lowest point of depression. Everything she put me through nearly pushed me to ending it all. After nearly jumping 3 times I decided to tell my therapist, and I was re-diagnosed as bipolar type 2. Within a year I was not suicidal anymore. Now, I may be still fucked up and traumatized, but I am stable. I can feel happy again. I hate that she was the event that led me to save my life. I wish I could just forget her and the trauma she caused me, but I cannot. she is an integral part of my life and the changes I made. I cannot change that. I just hope this trauma does not haunt me forever. I hate that the girl who nearly ruined my life was the catalyst that led to me saving it.",0

"I have always been prone to catastrophizing and only ever anticipating the worst. Last year, I had attempted suicide and wound up in a coma for two days. But lately, I have been feeling like I cannot understand why I would do that. I am excited about where life can take me and when I deal with something tough I feel this trust that it will resolve itself. I have been raised within a fundamental Christian household and been taught that only people with faith can achieve such a mindset and religion has always made me unhappy and that inadvertently felt guilt for that. I was in an unhealthy relationship back then and I felt like I really did not know who I was outside of that relationship. I have always wanted that mans validation and he dumped I remember hurting but since that relationship ended I have been making connections that have made me feel whole and I have come to accept that people come and go and I am completely okay with that. It felt like the past years have been completely traumatic and strangely enough I have been thinking about changing my name because I feel like my birth name is loaded with so much trauma I want treat that person like its someone else. I have been feeling this way more recently, I do not want my trauma to influence my decision, I just want to experience life as a new person. Is it optimism or denial",0
"I think this is the best approach I can have towards my suicidal tendencies. I can also admit I want attention, yes, I have to acknowledge that. I just feel so alone that it is hard for me not to try to remind that I am also here. I can be a decent person at times. Thank you for reading. I am not going to do anything but I really wish I had someone to talk to. Thank you.",1
"I just wish that life was different. My life is not even that bad on the outside, I have a great family, I live in a decent area, I do not really have many external struggles, and when I say that I do not mean to brag I am simply saying it for a little bit of context. I am 19 years old and for as long as I can remember I have just had this emptiness inside of me. I do not like to talk about it a lot with the people around me but it really is something that just eats at me. It feels like there is no middle ground for my emotions. One minute I can feel like life is great and the next I just wish I had not been born in the first place. I just wish I was not here. I have felt this way since I would say I was around 11 or 12. It feels like any bit of happiness I get is just a temporary high but I always come down and sink into this dark place that I cannot crawl out of. No matter what I just always end up finding myself in this pit. I just think of how I wish none of this had ever happened, I could have just not been born. I think about suicide a lot, but its not something I truly want to act on. Its not that I want to die, I do not truly want to die, I just wish Id never been here. I am not necessarily afraid of death, it feels like I am just kind of waiting for it to happen. I would not search for it but I am also not afraid of it happening. Id like to think that it would be comforting to know that everything just goes away. It would just be over. No more stress, no more sadness, no more worrying about this or that, just the peaceful notion that I do not have to deal with anything anymore. Does anybody else feel this way? I am tired of living a day to day life and feeling like I am trapped in this reality I want nothing to do with. I just want to be at peace. I just wish it had never happened in the first place. I just wish it was over",0
"He cries every day. The first thing he always talks about when he wakes up is how much he wants to die and wishes he did not wake up, everyday without fail. For months he is said everyday has made him want to die more than the last. Hes begged me to kill him, so hand him poinson while bawling so hard on the floor he cannot get up to get it himself. He said ""you would be mercy killing me"". He cannot go to a mental hospital for various reasons, we are both minors (I am emancipated hes not) living alone together, and he has quite a long time before he becomes an adult with controlling over his own life. His mom neglects him and refuses to give him the medical help he needs despite his therapist telling her how at risk he is for suicide, she will not allow him to transition (we are both transgender) and he feels like nothing could ever make him see the light through the dark. Not even me. Not even smoking weed helps him anymore because he does not even get stoned anymore and that is the only thing that slows his thoughts and eases his ptsd. On top of that were financially struggling and we cannot afford to keep buying weed but if I do not keep buying I risk coming home to find my boyfriend dead. I would reach out to authorities and ask him to be helped but we live in a rural bible belt community that would surely make things worse rather than better for him. He recently told me ""next time you go back to work, I am going to do it. I can give anymore. Its too painful. All of our friend manipulate us and we cannot trust them."" It took me days of spending every second bwside him to assure him I would not be ask okay as he thinks I would be if he was not here. He told me ""its going to be okay when I am gone. do not be sad, please move on and be happy."" He feels so alone like he only has me. And it took the risk of getting fired and losing the house to make him promise me I would not come home to a corpse. I told him I could not go back to work until I knew. I know he still wants to die more and more every day, and he cries more and more every day about the pain of being alive and reliving his trauma and worrying about everything and feeling so out of place and uncomfortable amd burdening in any situation hes placed in. I do not care how worn out and exaughsted I am only sleeping one hour a night making sure he does not kill himself, I love him and I need him. But I know its selfish to keep him here under so much suffering. I feel its comparable to watching somome go through chemo without hope of even going into remission, knowing they are going to die in pain and just wanting for that day to come. ""But I need you in my life"". ""But I need my life to be over to feel any sense of peace."" He tells me it follows him into his sleep. He cannot escape the PTSD and the trauma and the thoughts and his therapist treats him like a kid so they do not do sessions anymore because all she talks about is school, which is another reason he wants to die. He does not see any positives to living and it is rare for me to come up with ideas that actually make him feel better. He never feels better for more than a few minutes at a time. Hes been through depressive episodes before but none that have been this harsh and long, ever. I have never seen or heard of anyone who seems to be living in such a constant state of agony. He craves the pain of death because to him it is an answer to his prayers of escape. I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like it is only a matter of time before I loose him and he keeps telling me that too. there is no adults who can help him now, atleast not in the situation hes in. I just need to know what to say or do. I need to know that I am doing the right thing by keeping him alive, even though I can tell it tourchers him to be conflicted about hurting me and hurting more each day. Am I doing the wrong thing? Sometimes it feels like I am. Please help. I do not know how to help my boyfriend. What should I do?",1
"I promised myself that id stay out of this sub when i made this account. Not going too well so far haha.... I have not slept in 24 hours, maybe more. I have lost count. I am tired but i do not want to wake up only to be faced with disappointment. The right side of my teeth hurts from clenching so hard for a prolonged period of tiem without noticing it. I had a mini depressive episode earlier and i think i might be going mad sometimes. I want die so bad, its all that clutters my mind lately. I am not going to do it, not yet atleast but the thought sits there and taunts me. It makes me feel like i should do it sooner. I look around me and its all worth doing. I could end things, not suffer a day more. I am exhausted of the acts i have to pull, the sacrifices i have to make. When in the end, I am still a miserable wad of shit. I want to rest. Eternally. Sure I am a bit stepped aback from what is beyond that but frankly, i care more about ending this daily fight than what comes next, i could worry about it when the time comes. I wish someone could blow my brains out. I am pretty dumb haha",1
"Hey all, as the title suggests I have recently (last 3-4 months) been taking Citalopram. This is my first time being on Anti-Depressants. Anyway long story short, as an avid gamer I first started noticing my aim, reaction time and concentration starting to perish. Followed by troubles articulating words more than usual and now I am noticing that other little things are perishing a little and it could be anything, picking something up only to lose it a moment later, troubles using tools efficiently, kind of fumbling on the keyboard rather than instinctively hitting keys. Citalopram effecting my fine motor skills",0
"I am having anxiety where I do not want to talk with the other people, or cannot sleep or eat then because of that my relation to the other people including my family got worse where I feel more awkward to talk to them or to meet their eyes so I always lock my self to my room whenever my aunty or cousin visit our house, because of that I get overthinking where what if they think I am weird, or what if they start to dislike me or to hate me, since I cannot even talk to them because of that damn wall inside my hide that forbid me to talk with the other people and start to make an assumption of what my family thinks of me and that wall is my anxiety. So because of that some other people say that I am too pridefull or to queit, or snobby or arrogant but they do not know that each time i interact with them i always carefull about my expression or word in that way i can hurt them, becauee my looks bratty or pridefull but that not who i am, I am just carefull of everything, I even create a scenario of what should I say in order for them to think that I am not that kind of person But they cannot even see on who I am,and that is the reason why i start to shut my self to the world to them people around me and start to hate my self to thenpoint that i want to die because i know to my self how loser i am. Having anxiety can give me wrong impression to the other people",0
"i want to be able to come home to someone that wants to cuddle with me and likes me for who i am, but i know that is a fantasy because I am already thinking of killing myself and I am not even in high school i just want someone to like me",0

"I am 19 and I am lucky enough that my parents are not forcing me out on my own or into a career just yet. However, rn I can barely count on myself to wake up and do the bare minimum everyday. I cannot even sleep normally and wake up to alarms. I do not know how I am ever going to be able to live any sort of productive life st this point. For context I take medication to sleep at night and I still cannot fall asleep until early morning, I then cannot wake up at a reasonable time and if I try I am almost completely incoherent. The sleep medication is also a form of antidepressant so I have to choose between a healthy amount of sleep or my depression meds. I feel like a complete failure either way, and I am so scared of my depressive episodes but I have anxiety attacks whenever I have to do anything during the day because I feel as if I will not be able to wake up on time or get up. I do not feel capable of adult life",0
"I feel like I can do something and go crazy about it for some reason. For ex; I can wash the dishes and someone would push me, all of a sudden murder is on my mind? Like bruh I are not Light Yagami what is I doing? Hope you understand me xoxo I feel crazy but I cannot tell if I actually am",0

Anyone have any experience with this?Every time I have weened myself off SSRIs it is been a steady slow decent into the original state that got me to the point of needing SSRIs.

SSRIs and trying to get pregnant.,0
"Got broken up with four months ago and have been in the worst depressive episode since then. My heart has been physically hurting (I can feel the pain in my chest) every single day since then.

Its just another addition into the list of depressive symptoms I guess. Heart physically hurts",0

"just for context, i had a rough childhood, most of which i cannot remember. of course there are a few stray memories here and there, but for the most part my brain refuses to allow me to remember my childhood. i do know that i endured a lot of emotional abuse, and that i was neglected. my parents are divorced, and each have remarried and had new kidsabout 5 and a half years ago, I began to understand better how the world works, and how to be in touch with my emotions. and since then there has always been this constant nagging for me to just, pull the plug on life. i do not feel love from either of my two families, my friends never check up on me, I am afraid i have too much emotional baggage for my boyfriend to handle. and i do not just mean ""oh no! my family does not give me enough attention"", i mean i genuinely do not feel love for them or from them.i genuinely feel as though the world would not care about my death, and that i SHOULD end it, because if anything, people would be better off. my parents (who hate each other) would no longer be tied together by me, and they have their own new families that they would grow with, and forget about me. my friends hardly care about me anyways, so it would not make much of a difference there. and my boyfriend would not have to deal with my ever-changing moods and insecurities. I have been shutting my emotions off for a long time just to get through each day, but just recently I have allowed myself to 'feel' again, and it is becoming too much for me to handle. i got comfortable when things we are good and now that they are not i do not know if i can handle it. there is too many things wrong, not enough love from the world, myself or the people around me, and nothing to look forward to. i do not have an active plan, but i have had a few different plans that I have come up with that would make it quick &amp; easy. i guess i just need to think about it some more and see where i end up. the world would be no different without me here",1

I use to be too tired to do anything but now I exercise and get motivated to do everything I need to do. Then after that I just sit back and kill time. I enjoy nothing. I just get motivated enough to finish everything then find myself with 10 hours on my off days just waiting for the day to end. Can anyone relate to this i know it is weird but. Like I feel absolutely dead inside but somehow found this motivation to kick ass. But after all the necessities I just wait for time to go by.... :/ maybe it is because I still actually want to see how far I can go. Or maybe a hope for the future still who knows. Like it is super black and white. White as in I am motivated to kick ass. Then black as in completely dead waiting for the day to end. Also I am eating super healthy now too idk. Motivated to do what is necessary then lean back,0
"I have been a sports fan all my life.I also have been thinking about killing myself literally since I can remember. In many ways I feel my life is like a movie i have not seen yet but already know the ending to it. It ends with suicide, i have known this always.I grew up in s country that had not a lot of access to baseball, it was more of a soccer kind of a country. Circumstances have lead me to be only partially employed at the same time my marriage is going thru a rough patch. I think it is safe to say this is the most depressed i have been in my life. Folks, I am not sure how I come out of this one.Enter MLB opening day. Always been a baseball fan but never had the time and resources to really really follow a season (I get the MLB thingy for free with my phone provider so...)I watch all the games, every single game my team plays. I know the names, the averages the everything. Baseball has given me a reason to look forward to tomorrow, to see what happens the next weekend, the next series. My team sucks this year by the way but I do not even feel bad about it! I am like riding a high, while my world and my life collapse around me I am sitting like an idiot watching baseball and loving it!Truth is, we are halfway thru the season and I am dreading the end. No more baseball, no more looking forward. No more games means I can focus on my dark and gloomy circumstances and the fighting and the crying and I honestly do not know if i have the energy to keep putting up with it all.So here I am.Not in immediate risk of offing me but scared oh so scared of what the future may bring.TLDR: I do not think I am making it to Christmas people, love you all. I honestly think baseball is saving my life for now",1

"I am 25 yrs old (F) and I suffer from depression and anxiety. It just seems like life just has it out for me and I am falling deeper and deeper into this depressive state. I feel like I am being swallowed up whole and there just is not anything that I can do about it. It does not help either that I bottle up all my emotions and then turn around and cry myself to sleep every night bc of how horrible I feel about myself. Like somehow everything and anything bad that has happened to me is somehow my fault and that I deserve it. I truly feel that I do not deserve to be happy or that I am worthy enough to be loved in any kind of way.None of my best friends really understand the pain I have been feeling nor have any of them cared to connect the dots that I disconnected myself from all of my social media platforms. I do not blame tho, I get that everyone else is just living their lives but it would be nice for someone to notice that I am not myself anymore and have not been for a long time. Although I feel so alone, I do have one person in my life that I can always turn to and that would be my dad. Yet, I am ashamed to admit to him how low I feel all the time and that what I am feeling is far beyond my own personal control at this point. I also do not want him to know bc somehow I am afraid he will resent me for not being more strong minded like himself. Falling deeper",0

I would do anything for the people I love and I do that. But when I look around, its almost like constantly waiting for someone to return the favor. I seem like a background character to everyone, while I know some of my friends have people very central to their lives but those people are never me. I just am really at a bit of my own ropes end.

"I am being kicked out of my house by my parents once I turn 19 this January because I do not want to go to college yet. I told them I wanted to take a break from school since it stresses me out and gives me more anxiety but they still want me to go. They have told me that I will be paying for my own insurance and basically everything and I do not even know what to do. And my messed up head keeps telling me that the easiest way out is to kill myself.I know that I have people who care about me. I know people love me. My parents love me, even though they are homophobic and I have not come out to them yet. My boyfriend loves me, even though I have not told him that I want to transition to male. My best friend loves me even though it is hard for me to open up to him.But there is that small part in me that does not give a fuck that they love and care about me. I can be selfish all I want, I have been trying all my life to be as selfless as I can. I do not care that you want me to live. I do not want to live and I want to do whatever the fuck I want, even if that means taking my own life to end this shitty cycle.I have always been suicidal. Just not actively. When I was younger I always thought about situations in which I died. It carried on to where I am now and I cannot go a few hours without thinking about suicide.

"At first i did not know what it was, i just felt empty, sad, lost interest in all of my hobbies, nothing was fun to do anymore. I did not take it seriously, ""probably just your teenager hormones messing around"" i told myself.I began searching on the internet for weeks and i eventually understood what it was, fucking depression that is. Probably caused from many years of extreme shyness, social anxiety and self isolation, i was scared of people and i had no personality.I failed highschool 3 times, it took me 6 years to finish highschool. In my 5th year of highschool (19-20) years old) i only had 4 subject to finish, so i had pretty much 80% of free time the whole year. I promised myself i would get a job and actually be someone, do something with my life. I failed, got called for 6 interviews and i did not even attend 4 of them (huge panic attacks), last 2 were on a more discrete place with less people around so i eventually had the guts to go inside, first one i had a panic attack right at the beginning, interviewer seemed cool about it at let me take some deep breaths, i went through the interview but he said at the end ""I am sorry, but you should really consider seeking a therapist"". Last interview, i did sweat a lot, i had a very shaky voice, i was extremely anxious and could barely look at her in the eyes, 5 minutes into the interview she says ""you are not really qualified for this job, I am sorry"" and i left.After that day i hit the rock bottom, a few months later i rested my forehead on a loaded shotgun for more than an hour, trying to get the courage to pull the trigger but the only thing that came to my mind was my mom's reaction seeing me dead with my head blown out. I could not do it.Last year of highschool, only 1 subject left and again, could not even apply for a job, my anxiety was getting worse and so was my depression. One day at 5 in the morning i decided, this is it, I am going to end it right now. I got into my car and drove to the nearest cliff by the sea (huge 100m drop), i just sat there on the edge for about 20 minutes trying to find a reason not to do it, once again the only thing that i could think of was my mom's reaction. Eventually an old fisherman saw me and called the police, i kind of got away saying i enjoyed sitting while looking at the sea and i do it nearly every morning.Got into university at 21 years old, 2 years went by and just being occupied with something eventually kept my mind busy and suicide thoughts went away for once. Nowadays, 23 years old, 2 years of university went by, still never had a GF (or even a female friend), i made 0 friends, i still have 0 experience talking with women (i have not had a female classmate since i was 16). I promised myself that university would change my life just like it does to many people, once again, i failed myself (my social interactions got a lot better and people do not notice that much that I am weird, but I am still shy as fuck).Summer holidays just began, depression is growing again at a fast rate, no one to go out with, i have 3 friends from highschool but we go out like once a month at best, my closest friend just got a GF so he only talks to me like once a week just for regular stuff. 2 weeks ago i spent most of the time searching for ways to peacefully kill myself without making too much of a mess, i planned to jump of a 75m bridge into the water or maybe try again the 100m cliff, and also thought about taking a bunch of sleeping pills, go into my car and and let a butane gas cylinder open inside... I do not know how to help myselfSorry for long post, i have too much shit going on in my mind, and who knows if i end up doing it in the near future, i will send my reddit account to my closest friends so at least they know what i had going on in my mind. 4 and a half years of depression and suicide thoughts, is there any hope?

"I am tired. it is the same routine everyday. over and over again.i used to be a morning person before the pandemic happened. now i feel like a zombie waking up every morning. my mom wakes me up every morning, but never with a ""good morning"". it is always ""you are never studying"" or ""wake up you lazy ass"". cannot she, for once, notice that I am consumed by dark thoughts and sadness? (i would not say I am depressed, because I am not clinically diagnosed). yesterday, after my online class, i was having an existential crisis and just lying in bed crying the fuck out into my pillow. I am pretty sure my mom heard me crying, and chose not to ask me about it. and while i like to be left alone when I am having breakdowns, it would really have helped me if my mom had comforted me. instead, she chooses to always call me lazy. I am so sick of this. online classes suck, but that is a whole another story for another post. i just feel really really suicidal right now. there is nothing left to live for. my life is not going like I would imagined it. what is going to happen? should i really keep going? when I am actually contemplating suicide, i realize i want to hold on a little bit longer. that is when i realize i do not want to die, i just want to live. I am so tired of everything",1
"So if you are depressed, like I am, and are wondering about why you are here and what value you add to anything, I can assure you, doing something is not the answer. I bought about 150$ worth of art crap, paint, paper, brushes, canvas, all that shit and I sit here thinking its all crap. It looks childish and ridiculous. It clearly shows I have no idea what I am doing, or even why. When I see the work of others, they are serious and successful, and 30 years younger. There is no point to start something new at 52. My advice: just stop trying. I gave up. There is no reason for my existence. Try something new is bullshit",0
"Hello everyone,I have used drugs on and off throughout my teens. I am a twenty year old male that has lived a very happy and fortunate life. However, the lows that I have hit throughout have always truly haunted me. My family has a history of high-strung anxiety and off-and-on depression that has unfortunately trickled down to me, along with addiction issues (which I am lucky not to have fallen into). I have been through unconventional therapy that has really helped me as I hit rock bottom in my late teens - which is another exhausting story in of itself. I struggled with deep depression and was lost in life. I can expand on it if you would like later on.I am currently heading to my first year of college as a sophomore (since last years was entirely online). I struggle with chronic fear of public speaking and social anxiety as I had terrible experiences with my peers throughout high school, especially as I was living alone and fairly isolated. I plan on taking a second oral communication course to get over my fears since it still petrifies me. I am and have always been an extremely sensitive person and always wary of what people think of me.In short, I am looking for an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety prescription medication that is non-addictive, but at the same time will allow me to coast through life for the first weeks of my upcoming college year. I have tried Benzos but the side effects and soul-gripping addiction it causes is something I can not allow myself to fall into. Looking for a prescription medication that will allow me to basically feel emotionless and non-reactive, since as I mentioned I am an extremely sensitive person in general.I hope I am in the right subreddit. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Anti-Depressants/Anti-Anxiety Prescription Meds That Will Make Me Fairly Emotionless?",0
"Hi Guys,For the last year or so, I have been slowly losing motivation to do anything of worth. I do not want to go to work, I do not want to go to the gym, and if I can, I would remain in bed, within a dark room, and just be on my phone the entire day. I am addicted to it, and the worst of all is that I have no ambition for change. There is a part of me that just wants to continue this lifestyle of staying in bed, and a smaller part of me that just wishes that I can be motivated again. It also feels like I am becoming more and more unmotivated by the day, and thus only digging myself deeper into the grips of an unmotivated mindset. I do not feel depressed or sad, I just feel nothing. I do not care for anything and I do not even want to speak to people. The articles online do not help at ALL, but my psychiatrist recommended that I start taking CymGen 60, but it makes me feel weird when I take it. Does anyone have any experience with this medication? Does it get better? After reading this entire post again, I realize how pathetic I sound, and I do apogize for that. I just do not know what to do and whom to turn to. All advice on how to get out of this deteriorating mindset will be appreciated. Thank you all, and stay safe out there. My lack of motivation is going to destroy my life",0
"I truly thought I had beaten my depression but then god said ""fuck you"" and I am right back where I started. I just cannot do this anymore. every time I get up I just get knocked back down. plus ADHD is not making things any easier. I can see myself deteriorating and I cannot do anything to stop it. I have just resigned myself to a life of depression. since I keep getting knocked down what is the point of getting up I am back",1
"As the title says, I want to die, I really do, but I cannot, I am scared to die, I am scared to move on to whatever is next, I hate myself and know the world would be better if I was gone but I simply cannot, how do I do it without being scared, is there a painless way, this isint a one time thing, or something happened and this is an irrational conclusion, I looked at the facts, and know I am better off not here I do not think living is worth it to be honest but I am too much of a coward to die",1
By all accounts I should be dead right now. The amount of pain and hardship I have been through is not something that I can just live with. Basically any kind of normal life for me is out of the question. Despite me being depressed 24\7 I am just not in the mood to end it. What the hell? Why do I still want to go on?,0
"Everything about my life that can go wrong is going wrong. I cannot have a moment of peace without dark thoughts clouding and I.I do not even know what to rant, the only thing keeping me alive is knowing that my family will be devastated without me. I do not want to blame anyone but me. I really really need someone to tell me its going to be okay and they are going to have my back but I cannot ask anybody. I cannot keep smiling in front of my mom as if everything is alright. Hope god had given us an easy way out of this world. I am not looking for any kind of help here, I do not even know why I wrote this. I survived 1 year since my last post. But I do not think I can anymore.",1
I do not want to fail and still live with the attempt. It cannot be super painful either because Ill just back out of it out of fear. Thanks. What are the best ways to kill yourself?,1
"When I read about people withdrawing during depression, I read about how they stay at home, etc etc.I have been struggling with depression for a long time now and recently got better, but now it is back to being bad again. Ever since I quit meds it is gone this route. I hardly maintain contact with friends and have now officially decided to take a break from social media.I know this is bad but the strange thing is that I still do everything else. I leave the house everyday. I grocery shop, do the dishes, laundry, I want to go to places like art museums and go out shopping or do writing/art but I want to be alone. I am not lying in bed all the time either.For some reason I just do not want to have any contact/talk to anyone. This concerns me but I do not know why I feel like this.I am also struggling to feel emotions right now and have lost interest in what I love, I seriously do not even feel human at some points, which might be why I do not want to talk to people, because I do not want to keep up this facade that I am interested in the conversation. Yet I am still going out and doing stuff and have some interests. I just feel totally dead emotionally? I do not know how to explain it but I am trying to pull away from the internet to ""recharge"" and whatnot.Any advice or any similar situations would love to hear your advice, thank you Socially withdrawing but still doing everything else...",0
"i have not been able to cry in a long time which is way out of the norm of me. for the past month it has felt like there is something bottled up within me and it is suffocating me. but i finally did it, i cried. now that i think about it, cry is probably a stretch. i she would a tear but for those 15 seconds i felt all my anger dissolve a little. it is so tiring to deal with this shit all the time. i feel shitty. this is shitty. shit. i do not think normal people thinking about ending it all this much. i cried today.",0
"I quit my job on Friday bc I was supposed to be starting a new one on Monday. Turns out I did not get the job. I cannot go back to the old job. And finding another job is going to take a little while. Plus the waiting period before insurance kicks in. Basically I just threw away my health insurance &amp; my income for nothing. Now I will not be able to afford my psychiatrist appointments or any of the 8 medications I take. So pretty much I am torn between killing myself now or waiting until I am without the medication and the hallucinations, etc come back to kms. Decisions, decisions. Fml",1
"everyone is fakeeveryone acts like they care then BOOM they backstab you! what is the point of even being in this world if only fake people live in it? Being cheated on, being backstabbed by my best friends, having bad luck with dating and being alone for yearswhy have not I given up yet?Maybe this is a sign that I should just give upfuck it I guess I am killing myself this week! Guess this is it, Id appreciate not actually being born in the first place if I knew life was like this God I just hate my life",0
"Where do I start, therapy is not going as planned. I just sit there and talk about the things that are destroying me, without getting any help. I got kicked out of college because I was too anxious to go into the classes. I ruined another friendship because I did not have the energy to talk all the time, and I was too problematic, and that I bring the mood down. My grandma was rushed into hospital last night for a blood transfusion, and now her health has plummeted, which has fucking crushed me. I have been having a mental breakdown I do not know how long, I am tired, in pain, and just ready to give up. I feel like I am losing my life and cannot stop it. I honestly had hope that I could change things around",0
I am so lonely it physically hurts. I cannot open up to people so I am in a prison of my own making. I will never be anyones first choice. I have nothing to offer. I am a loser. Literally the own thing keeping me from killing myself is my dogs. And the fear that Ill fuck it up and end up permanently disabled or disfigured. I hate this life. I hate myself. Fuck. I am an afterthought,1

"I just hate my current life. I have lost all interest in things that usually excite me and it is like I am just stuck in a cycle of being in a depression slump, wanting to do more, trying stuff and realising I cannot enjoy things anymore, then going back into a slump etc. I can tell I am slowly pushing people away, getting ansty with them and nowadays it is an achievement to even make my bed in the morning. Every day is so grey and monotonous no matter what I do. Is there any way I can bring some sort of spark back into my life? The issue is not really doing things because I try that, it is more just trying to feel passions again. How to start living again?",0

I do not look forward to my future at all. I was not allowed to follow my dreams bc of controlling parents and now I am stuck pursuing a degree and wasting thousands of dollars on something I really do not care about. On top of that my dad is being a jerk and has been giving me the silent treatment for a week after we got into an argument. I have apologized multiple times but hes a very stubborn person and a narcissist and refuses to apologize to me or talk to me. All in all I am just really tired of everything. I have been wanting to selfHarm again. All I can do is sleep. I just need a break from life The future seems stupid,1
"I hate being lonely all the time. I always hope someone will give a shit and talk to me but no one ever does. I keep getting told I have to meet people but how the fuck am I supposed to do that, especially nowadays. Everyone ik is slowly disappearing into their good jobs and S.O's while I am here bottom of the making no money and have been single and will be for the rest of my shitty existence. I cannot do things with people because I cannot afford it so I left in the dust forever. If I have to endure this alone why should I have to endure at all, I mean the people who would be hurt would just get over it, and they all have their superb lives to return to so it is only fair I get drop my garbage one I am alone and depressed and it is not going to ever change so fuck it why not just off myself",1
"Since age 10 or so I have never had a friend that cared about me, only those shitty ass school ""friends"", whose only activity was to play fucking boring and dumb video games. My whole teen life was thrown away with sitting in front of a rectangle screen and wasting life. Now I realized that life brings joy with good friends and meeting each other. Fuck man, I have never experienced that! Everytime I go to the city I see groups of people and then there is me, awkwardly going alone through the streets... Of course there is my older brother, who has a good paying job, a wife, good friends and he even moved 3 times already! And there is me, 18 years old, finished highschool and I am scared of job life. In 4 days I should be applied to studying something and I know that I cannot do it. Of course I got bullied in secondary school and since then I did not even know what the word ""social"" meant.This should not even be such a long text but I felt like ranting today.. I hope someone can relate :c Anyone else never had a good friend, who was interested in you? (after childhood)",1

"I am a 17(f) Lately I have been feeling more and more depressed, I look back at my old self and how I used to be when I was younger. I used to be filled with life and always hang out with friends I had a good relationship with my family I would say that that was probably the best part of my life so far sadly:/I cannot even look at myself in the mirror I always avoid mirrors because I hate myself.Coming from a mexican household my mother does not believe in mental health problems. She always says ""you have food, clothes, and a roof over your head! Why are you sad? You should be grateful for all the things you have.""My parents are divorced, I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own. My oldest brother had a huge argument with my mom and they have not spoken/seen each other for four years. I also have a 2nd oldest brother who has Autism, he is also mute and he pretty much needs help with everything. he is pretty calm and does not look like he has special needs, but he makes noises which annoys me and I feel bad for being embarrassed/annoyed with him. Right now I am living in an apartment with my mother and Autistic brother. My mom has to work 24/7 so that means that I have to look after my brother which feels like a full time job. I can never go out without bringing him along because I cannot leave him alone I am already embarrassed by him so I cannot even go out. I feel like even if I wanted to move out I could not because I have no money and I have no opportunity to go and make money for myself. My father is also pretty absent in my life:/I also have no friends because my best friend of 8 years and my friend group decides to exclude me out. I was bullied by them my sophomore year.I feel like I am stuck, everyday is the same. I do not see a reason that I should keep waking up everyday. I am not pretty or skinny so that does not help either. I just want to pause my life and breathe and to go be able to do the things I want to do but I cannot.

Maybe it is bcz it is online but my counsellor constantly looks dissatisfied and as if I am spewing bullshit and am the most disgusting creature, on top of that, she is a complete asshole.

"When ever I get this hypothetical question I cannot decide. Because 10 years ago; a younger me without depression existed. Some of my happiest memories took place, my friendships were deeper , and I had considerably less stress in my life. But I cannot help but wonder that if I go back to before I got severe depression would I be able to go back to that time and enjoy it; or would I still have my current depression( because I know what is coming). As much has Id love to go back in time and make better decisions; go to college early, be more honest with the people closest to me, take more pictures, have more fun, be a better person, and do considerably better in school, going back that far would change who I am now. I would have never met my current partner; never experienced the last year ( the same way). And if I had to go back and live through the happiest years of my life with severe depression, it would hurt me a lot. If you could go back to 10-20 years into the past with all the knowledge you had now : would you?",0
Went to the doctor and told them about my mental health issues. They put me in lexapro. I was always so scared to tell even anyone about my mental health and it felt good to finally do something about it. I am not out of the woods yet. But maybe I am on the right track I finally did it,0

I am writing this not for signs of help or to think everything will turn out okay but for a sense of closure, I can no longer deal with the hardships or pain or misery and want nothing more than for all of it to end,I write this as a final goodbye in hopes that someday it eventually reaches my family.I am sorry to everyone this affects and hope that you can forgive me and the decision that I have made,I love you all and goodnight I do not know where else to go",0

I hate when people share with me good news because I am so envious. I hate that every time I muster up the energy to try again I am met with complete and total opposition at every level. I hate that I never had a choice to be born into a poor, abusive family. I hate everything about myself and this experience I am forced to endure each and every moment of my life.

"I am pretty decent at solving complex algorithms, very functional at work, super into science &amp; math.When it comes to expressing my feelings visually or audibly, I really suck at it. Idk if it comes from childhood or some other because, I look like a robot when dancing, flirting, speaking to a group of people or even showing my anger.I keep trying day-to-day to improve but it feels very unnatural to show emotions. I just cannot do it. I am not a sociopath or anything, I feel so much on the inside, but unable to show it effectively to others. I look like a weirdo or a creep when I try to. I guess this is one of the main reasons of why I keep getting rejected. I hate having to express emotions visually",0
"i have not contemplated suicide in 8 days. i was in a horrible place just one month ago, was admitted to the psych ward, and now I am somewhat happy. my depression, social anxiety and ocd are finally under control. i can literally just socialize without sweating from fear, or my brain fogging up to the point where i can barely speak. its insanewhen i see my friends I am talkative again - I am the guy they grew up with, instead of the depressed, quiet shithead who showed up and never spoke. i find myself genuinely enjoying things again. one month ago, fun or happiness was a feeling i had not felt in years. my self-esteem has improved too. one month ago, i was completely convinced that i was a worthless, horrible person who deserved to burn in hell. i was convinced i was useless and capable of nothing. now, i think I am an ordinary human being. i matter as much as everyone else does. I am not inferior to my friends or family.

"No matter how much I try, I can never see on why someone would willingly talk to me with their time and actually treat me like a human. I have such a negative mindset onto myself that I cannot fathom why people would talk to the likes of me.Do they talk to me out of pity? Want something from me in the future as 'compensation'? Do they really not have anyone else better to talk to? Other than these 3 questions that I always get into my head, I cannot help but wonder why else they would talk to me without hating me as a person.I cannot help but wonder if I just tried a little harder, maybe I would not be suicidal either and probably would not have to think of these negative thoughts over and over again. Why do I feel like everyone secretly hates me?",1
"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out",0

I knew depression would take away friends, make sadness my default emotion, i did not know it would take away the only things in life that gave me comfort, now, there is nothing to distract me anymore from the constant dark thoughts.

Well, the medication takes time to get used to.Getting over a breakup, that was caused because I loved her too much? It takes time to get over that.The other people are either sick and twisted for giving me false hope when they know it will not amount to anything, or they are simply too stupid to realize that they are in denial. Its been 8 entire fucking years. I am sick of waiting for something, some kind of relief, that will never come.

I have lowered my standards so much. i just want to feel ok. why is it so hard just to feel ok. why am I being manipulated every day. why are my relatives and everyone my mom takes to being manipulated into hating me. why cannot someone stand up for me. i cannot stand up for myself anymore. i cannot hold it down for much longer. i wanted to live. i still do. i want to so fucking bad. but if living means living like this? i do not want to live. i much rather die. i cannot do this anymore,1

"How did you take your first step? How would I go about telling my parents ""i need help""? I am a 23 year old college dropout who has no future to speak of. I see nothing but darkness ahead of me. I feel like a parasite leeching off my parents for sustenance. I feel like, no, I AM a sore thumb when compared to my highly successful elder sisters. My existence is a waste of space. How do I tell my parents all this? Even my friend who i met online who i opened up to turned his back on me. I have no one to talk to. For those of you who suceeded in opening up",1

I am not even sure how to describe it, nothing terrible has happened, I have dealt with feeling bad and depressed for all my life and always kept it to myself and occasionally had episodes where I have imploded and felt like shit, but today's different, I was having a normal day and something triggered a real bad depressive episode, I feel numb, and the only thing going through my head right now is harming myself, I do not care about anything else. I have deleted all my social media and instant messaging apps, and the only thing I am looking forward to is going home, burying myself in bed and crying, I am scared and I do not know how to react to this, I have not had any suicidal thoughts since I was 14 (I am 25 now) and that is the only thing lingering in my head right now. I feel like I have dug myself in a hole too deep to get out of, I have nobody to talk to about this in real life. I do not even know why I am posting this. Worst depression episode ever.",0
"I have been doing very poorly... I have ideation of suicide but no plans to do so. I recently moved to a new state, discovered I was trans (mtf), came out to some close friends, and recently re-entered the closet. (it is not the best time for me to follow through, I cannot afford to transition and I would be essentially exiled from my entire extended and immediate family.) I needed help and desperately tried reaching out to my close friends, but they will rarely speak to me now. When I confronted them about this, they gave the typical excuses of ""we have just grown apart,"" or ""lives are too busy to keep in touch,"" or ""I am just not good at maintaining long-distance friendships,"" and other assorted ways to assuage responsibility for being my friend. it is somewhat understandable, but I have no one here. I am living in my parent's house, alone, while they fucked off to the north for vacation. I am spending six weeks in complete isolation while I do my job through Doordash. I have taken to alcohol, drink 2 or 3 Four Locos per night, finish off any empty cans when I wake up. I am a mess, and when I ask for help, my friend have responded with silence. I get a response once a day if I am lucky, and it is always some half-hearted ironic ""oof"" or ""same.""I know they would regret that response if I were to unalive myself, which is disturbingly what I secretly wish. Them to be wrapped in pain and regret for not being there when I needed them most. I know it is sickening, and I hate myself even more for thinking it. But I long to be mourned, even though I will never live to see those reactions. I only want to live in the memories of loved ones, because physically living is just... hell. Even when I hold the absurd privileges of upper-middle class existence, there is no joy, no happiness. Just stale wheat toast without butter, it is burnt black coffee that is gone lukewarm. The pointlessness, the endless trudging on, knowing you will be faced with more meaninglessness. The connections we make become the ladder out of this pit of despair, but my ladder just is not there anymore. And I have no fucking idea how to build one. My friends are not there for me",1
"anyone else feel like they are just waiting to meet someone so you can have a person again to do fun things with all the time, text your every thought to, and just be happy with? also i know people will say happiness comes from within and not a relationship but idk that is just how i feel lately being single has made me very depressed",0
"I remember in middle school we had group projects to do and I decided to just work on my own and a classmate said I was a lone wolf. I only just remembered that recently because I went and saw wolves on my 23rd birthday. It kind of makes me feel a little bit better to relate to a wolf. I remember in high school during a fire alarm the entire school was outside waiting for a long time to go back inside and My history teacher asked me if I had any friends. I did but they were on the other side of the school I remember having to take the bus to school and walking around the hallways alone. I remember during lunch my theatre friends had rehearsal and I ended up sitting in the library alone. I remember me and my good friend being told, after being the last two standing in gym class that we could just go to whatever team we wanted because I guess nobody was going to pick us. I remember doing cheer and not being friends with any of those girls. I remember even after high school just being someone you know because you know my friend. And I am not really that important or maybe I am not that interesting to anyone. I am afraid this is going to last forever. Please do not last forever i cannot keep feeling this way. I feel like a burden, I feel so unwelcome in this world and I love this world. I love this earth and its nature and I love these animals and I love pure people and I love art whether it be art or music or books or history or the mysteries of the universe and I just never felt like I have ever gotten any indication that I belong here because it really feels like I am in a glass box and incapable of having a pure connection with another person who might actually care about me I got used to being alone",0

I try as hard as I can at my job but my boss calls me a retard and degrades me but honestly while hes an asshole hes just telling me what I already know and is just confirming it from a professional standpoint. I have not had a girlfriend in 8 years. Trust me not an angry incel or anything along those lines, I am just not worth it . I am not fat but not skinny .definitely been told I am ugly enough times for me to think there is a decent amount of merit to it. So I am crippling lonely. But I am the only one to blame, and no ones home and I think I just want to talk to anyone even if its a stranger like you, just want someone to know I think what I am about to is the rifht decision. do not know why I post here btw, mods banned me without response or explanation before in the past for things not against the rules.

"Technology has invaded every part of our lives and the almighty algorithms are ever present, destroying our ability to listen to each others, lobotomizing us, and robbing us of our time and energy. Propaganda and other methods of political manipulation are rampant. We are swiftly destroying the natural systems that support our life in order to give the one percent a little more powerpaper to hoard and everybodies too fucking busy being ""entertained"" to notice or work up the energy to revolt. Mars is a lie, we cannot even manage to not kill each other on this planet, that actually supports life.Financial crisis is only going to get worse, since we will not have another way to drill oil to save our asses like it did in 2008. it is really fucking tough to plan your life when NOTHING seems solid anymore. There is not a cultural framework I could lean on to help me make decisions, my emotions tell me to kill myself so I cannot listen to them either. The only thing I have to rely on is my flawed rationality and it seems impossible to take in enough information to predict anything because the world is changing so rapidly.it is not only like I am falling apart and am disillusioned with everyhthing it is like the whole world is. I do not have the motivation to get out of bed most days, barely have the energy to manage my personal life, and sure as hell do not have the energy to save the world. I am in therapy now but this all seems so real, I do not know if it will make any change, I sure hope so. cannot shake the feeling that it is already over",0
"that is the worst. I tried to tell them about my huge mental struggle. At first, they were a bit supportive, but after a while they told me to stop complaining and get my shit together. I remember the day when I tried to tell my mum how deeply unsatisfied I am and she stopped me with ,,Enough complaining! Just do sthg about it.'' Well, after that, their impression is that things got better. I moved back to the dorm, so they do not see me often. They sincerely think I solved my problems. However, the reality could't be more different. I am totally losing it and planning my suicide. In one moment I am researching for suicide methods and in the other my mom calls and I respond with the lies I have prepared - how university is better, how my job is better, how I feel okay. And this is the worst feeling. Lying to my parents all the time. On the other hand, I cannot tell them the truth - they are fed up with it and have no means to help me. They would't understand. The worst feeling is lying to my parents that everything is OK",1

"Sorry for the alt but people that still care about me use reddit and I cannot let them find out. My entire life sucks and I cannot take it anymore. Whatever I do, I fuck everything up. Everything I do goes wrong. If I breathe in, some bad thing happens in my environment. Fuck that. My entire life is a failure and I cannot take it any longer. I do not care about anything anymore so I will just leave a note why my entire life sucks. Doubt anyone will read anyway.I am ugly as fuck. I was born too early and I am extremely short. If I eat more than 1 meal a day I gain weight. that is why I am slowly becoming overweight. Even people who pass me on the street call me ugly. I am an adult and my body stopped aging around puberty. Guess how fucking miserable I look. I have not smiled for the last 15 years probably. Most of my friends abandoned me and if I want something from them it is always me to contact them. I do not have any special talents. Had to run away from home to be able to move out. Did wageslave jobs that resulted in permanent back pain and back/bladder issues. Every minute on the toilet is painful as fuck. I spend the entire day in front of my pc and the back pain is so strong that I need extremely strong painkillers that are almost like drugs at this point. When I take them everything feels like I am on a drug trip and I start to enjoy it but I am useless for the rest of the day. Alcohol also makes me feel good but I cannot always afford it. I will never be able to have a relationship anymore because my first boyfriend abused me and locked me in his home, my first girlfriend cheated on me with my ex boyfriend. I cannot even watch porn anymore because PTSD kicks in. Horrible right? And recently I realised that I am trapped in the wrong gender very likely. If I look in the reflection in the mirror I do not feel like it is me. I do not even know what I am at this point. I thought everything would be better if I join uni but I keep fucking up my minor. I am below average in my major and can pull through but my minor fucks me. I failed at least 2 classes each semester and if it would not be for covid I would have already been kicked out. I am now taking a minor class for the third time and I still got 0 points in the mock exam. I fucking suck. I hate myself for going this way. I feel like a fucking retard doing a class three times. And this is supposed to be a freshman class. It will only get harder. My uni however has finally given me the chance to escape this cruel world. I get to study abroad and they pay the tution fee. This is my chance. In 2 months I will fly to a different country, quit all my insurances so you cannot take me back! I will probably cut my veins in a public toilet and die a miserable death. Nobody will find out if I have died because everyone excepts me to be gone for 6 months. My death will never be announced to them because I am in a different country. Because I will burn all my public documents, nobody can identify me. I will be missing in action forever. it is only these 2 last months and after that I am finally free. I just need to pull it off. Just 2 more months and I can finally leave this world forever. do not mind my short rant.",1
"only thing holding me back is the debt i would leave my family. just want to pay that off and leave them with as much as i can so i do not leave any sort or burden, at least any more than i already will just need to take care of one thing before i completely turn the light off",1

It just feels like whenever i open up to people i consider family and friends IRL, they just push me away and then because I feel like I am melting, I end up leaking my feelings and thoughts on social media where it gets screenshotted and used against me and like I really cannot handle this stuff anymore. I screwed up my one chance I had to go to university thanks to losing intrrest in my college course thanks to losing my great-grandfather and I just fell so hard and if I am honest with the exception of a few months in late 2019-early 2020, I have not really ever got over it.Another thing that has made me angry is that imy coping mechanism for severe depression (eating) has now became my because of it, it is fucking unfair and I am so fed up with it. I am 22 years old and feel like no matter what happens, i am always going to be unemployed, always going to be lonely and always going to be living with my mother and never actually do anything with myself.

"The person who supposedly is there for me is not. My family only cares for me when it comes to ask for a service or a favour, and they do not really care for me, whether it would be successes or when I am down.

All day, I am cleaning, doing chores, cooking for someone who does not even thank me and just does not care about it. I feel like a burden to my friends, to my boyfriend, and I do not see myself keeping it like that.I am exhausted, I do not even want to die but I just want it to stop. I am killing myself with anxiety, I hate myself, and I keep pushing my limits even though I know I have crossed them long ago.

"I have posted here a couple years ago on another account which is now deleted, posted some poems and other stuff and thought you might like, anyway. 2 years ago I made an attempt, which gone wrong and I ended in the psych ward of my local hospital. Quickly enough I realized what actually was at stake when I was showed all this love and affection, attention and care, which kind of ""cured"" me for a while. did not thought about it for 2 years.Meanwhile I had a good life, found what I want to do in life, found a romantic partner who is loyal and loving, as a clueless romantic, this is far more than what I have expected a couple years ago lol. My parents moved back together, I even helped them! I found new friends to enjoy what I like with and everything, pretty much literally, is hundreds of times better than it was, my life improved in every aspect.Until recently.I recently started having what I would call minor anger issues, throwing what can only be qualified as tantrums, at my age I am pretty ashamed of myself as this is not me, and I feel like it is not me when I do this.I also started having alimentation problems again, barely eating anymore as I do not have the appetite to, I drink a lot however, more than I ever did. I am tired of my work, I am tired of my family yet I love them and they have not done anything wrong.Recently I caught myself contemplating suicide once more, the same way it began many years ago. I try not to by distracting myself by playing online video games, getting on a call with someone or just not being all by myself, as this always was one of my main triggers in the past. I feel like I do not have to be here, and that my purpose itself is not as meaningful as I thought it was. I need help once again. I restarted contemplating suicide lately, 2 years after my last visit to the psych ward",0
"Hi .... hum ... I am on the news as usual, my family knows I was raped ... and I do not think they believe me ... As a result I am stressing and the nightmares and memories are coming back, memories of being raped or assaulted... I cannot fucking take it anymore, I am at my fucking wit's end and my brain cannot stop... from recounting these shitty memories... why all this shit happened to me .... I... I cannot take it anymore... I cannot enjoy anything except gaming and my ps4 died this morning so I am disgusted and if you are wondering, I am a boy, I am 16 so I am in the middle of puberty but I am probably sterile because my bullying in primary school made people hit me in the balls to sterilise me so I do not have a sex drive so sexual pleasure is absent so if you are wondering, sex does not give me pleasure (plus I am traumatized by it...)

"Everyone has a policy and now I have mine. But the one weird thing holding me back was guilt when I know they do not really care about me or my emotions. they will turn their back on me when I need them or laugh at me or throw my struggles in my face but when I manage to pull myself out of a dark place they enjoy being there like they did something. I do not even know why I was worried. I guess because I feel empathy for them because I know what it feels like to not have anyone care but whatever. I do not really have anything left. I tried hobbies and making friends but I do not have the patience or energy to maintain them. I do not like or feel connected with people and whatever people I have in my life I am definitely the least favorite and least liked. I hate school, I hate my program. I can no longer find joy in the little things like music or food. I have tried therapy, multiple therapists and either they are too expensive or they are not good. I tried to joint a program where I feel like Id be around more caring people just to feel a community and have someone who sees the world similarly to me but that also backfired. there is just nothing keeping me here anymore. I am going to go read and finish the policy and start planning. My family is taking a life insurance policy out on me so at least I can leave them with something",1

If you do not have other friends already people sniff it out from a mile away and then keep their distance. And the same goes for relationships.I am far to anxious to get through a job interview, I know if I try Ill just have a panic attack and make a fool of myself.The strange part is that at this point, I am not even sure if I could consider myself depressed, its just that I hate myself constantly.Despite what poor shape my life is in, I know I am defiantly capable of turning it around.

"I had a car accident back on Halloween night 2020. I do not have much info other than the car went off road and rolled several times, went airborne, than landed on its wheels again after hitting a rocky wall. Was air lifted from scene to hospital in Indianapolis. Was kept sedated in Neuro ICU for 3 days while on life support ( left lung full of fluid, right one developed pneumonia. Many broken ribs, Sort term memory problems etc, etc. Since the wreck I have had problems with smell and taste ( even showering makes me throw up and/or gag (body wash and soap smells like rotten meat and garbage). Most things I eat and smell are the same. I have suffered with severe pain from a herniated disc at the l4/l5 vertebrae and have had foot drop the whole time. (Seeing neuro surgeon this month and recently received a foot brace that helps me walk normally somewhat) Confirmed by MRI 8 months after the accident. I received nothing for pain, and most times my own family turns the other way when I am in pain because they do not want to hear my moans (It bothers them). I went back to work 4 months after the wreck so that I could maybe be less of a burden ( my fiance had been going above and beyond in helping me, but becoming more strained as time went on and less tolerant of my inability to do ""certain things"") Even work had changed... I was fired as a proto tech a month before covid went BOOM! I am in my mid 40's but I have always been strong, independent and self reliant. I have always worked hard, and for the previous 3 years took better care of myself. I quit smoking cigarettes, quit drinking pop, and eating healthier, worked out on a very rigid and strict routine.

I went from 180 pound to almost 300 by December (finally back down to 215 june of this year) I have grandkids that are, wow..when I think about them..I think the are my only anchor. I do not know where to turn or what to say or to whom to say it too. I wish I could go back and not have the accident but I cannot...so how do I make others realize that?

"(19 F) Why is that I am always forgotten or ignored? I am really giving my best to be the best friend to my one and only friend. I comfort them whenever they want to talk about their problems, help them to solve these problems or anything. I already told her last autumn when I really just had enough that I understand she has a life. But why is she always ignoring my messages and only seeing them when we meet at school and I ask them ""what is wrong, why did not you responded to my messages yesterday?"". And no, I am not bombing her with messages. Only the normal conversation between friends: ""you want to go anywhere tomorrow after school?"", ""have you read that-"", ""i cannot do this hw, help me please?"", sending memes, etc - just on the minimal, like 1 message/2 days. She knows god damn well that I have no one else to talk to. it is hard for me to bottle up everything again when I thought I finally got a friend who can listen to me. it is so damn suffocating because I cannot do anything. Even now. I am working overboard for 2 months now. Not a single ""wassup"", ""so how is it going"" or anything. Nothing. And I see her being online all the time because she is not working. And before someone says it why am I not writing her first well, I was always the one to do that. I may be stupid and stubborn right now but I do not really care. Let it be a test if I should continue this or no. The shittiest is that I do not even feel sad about it because this situation is not new for me. To be alone and just living through every day. But it is hard when you get here again after experiencing everything that a friendship can offer you. I feel hopeless and kind of empty.I just really want someone to listen to me. Just once.

"So many posts I have read from teens and 20 year olds wanting to end it. It makes me sad. I was there, and we really have no idea how little of the world we seen. And how hopeless it really is not (for the most part). I have managed to make it this far. But I am not entirely sure I am supposed to go much further. I never saw myself getting ""old"" and maybe this is why.I ran away when I was 16. Dad left when I was five, my mom was an alcoholic and had two more kids with a married man. She died three years ago. I have had a hard childhood...blah blah blahEver since I left home I have been fighting for a better life. I believe life is choices. You wake up and choose to be better then your past. You recognize what is right and wrong and know how it feels to be bullied and not loved and demeaned, so you choose to act the opposite, embrace people and be there for friends because you know what it is like to be alone and you do not want anyone to feel like that, like this. Things are supposed to get better. I am now 43. I have worked two jobs my entire life until I turned 40 and mentally could not take it anymore. I have not been on vacation in over 20 years. I have student loan debt. do not go to college, it is a scam.Last year I was laid off from March until January due to Covid. I had to move. All my savings is gone. I have $20 in my bank account. I am tired. I am supposed to return to work in August, September at the latest. The last three weeks I have thought about death. Have written my note in my head over and over. They say money cannot buy happiness, but it can buy relief. When you do not know how you are going to pay your rent and bills it gets overwhelming every...single... day.I see so many posts about people having good jobs and money and husbands and wives and kids. People who have a ""good life""; but you still want to die? there is no help. I am not ready yet. I still cry when I think of it, but I am not scared to do it. I am just not ready yet. But the thoughts come more and more and I do not think it will be too long. I am trying to memorize things...how things feel, smell, and look. Subtle differences that we take for granted every day or miss. Like how someone is eyes light up or how a smile spreads across someone is face.So, my younger ones, think about your life. See the beauty in what you have. You have so much a head of you and there is much joy in this world. Love yourself. You may think you have nothing and no one, but if you think about it, it is probably not true. Find something, anything to keep up the good fight. And it can turn out good, so I am told. I am trying. You try too. Xoxo To all the Young",1
"Whenever I feel anger, sadness, frustration, or any other negative emotion, there was a number of ways for me to escape. Such as going on a walk, biking, hanging out with friends, and such. A personal favorite is just listening to music. However, it seems like recently nothing is helping. As if I have used it so much that I grew tolerance. Like drinking so much coffee that you do not feel energized. I have been feel more stress, dread, and frustration that I cannot even listen to a very good song without thinking about my mistakes and how shitty I am. I cannot stop thinking about how much I hate being myself. These escapes were my way of feeling better, and I could not and still cannot seem to talk to anyone because it feels that it would not help. I would just feel even more shitty by making them feel worried.I just want to be able to listen to music and relax. Losing My Escapes.",0
"I am such a retarded fuck up, you know what I am tired of hearing? I am tired of hearing my school counsellor or my soccer coach telling me shit like 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Surely, one would think, if they were capable of basic human tasks, i.e. Not fucking up everything you do, the most basic of tasks in a sport, or talking to people, or giving people eye contact for god's sake, you would not **need** to **artificially** boost yourself esteem. Because you **are** capable of those things, you are capable of functioning as a social-able human. You know how fucked my self-esteem is? Sometimes, well actually, most of the time, I hate having a fucking shower because I hate seeing my disgusting retarded fucking body in the mirror. Despite being told by some that I am too skinny, or that I am normal, etc etc. I still feel and I still am a fat fucking retarded loser. I do pretty decent at school, I got an estimated ATAR of \~84 for Year 12. I wanted to be a pilot in the RAAF, but how the fuck am I ever going to achieve that if I am just an autistic bumbling piece of shit retard who cannot have a conversation with their mates one on one. I can do speeches to a class, or hell, even the school fine; but when it comes to talking to someone or having a conversation, I just cannot. I literally want to kill myself as an escape. I remember early 2019 (I think), I was plus-oned (since I never get invited to parties, not even my own friends') to a girl's party who I somewhat had a crush on (if you would even call it that, I do not think I had ever spoken to her, even to this day). Being the socially inept fuckwit that I am, I practically held on for mercy to my friend group as it slowly deteriorated as they spoke to other guys, and women who they did or did not know at the party. Eventually I was all alone, kind of just awkwardly sitting on my phone in the corner while everyone was having fun in the pool. You want to know what I was thinking while everyone was exploring their teenage lives with girls or having fun with their mates? I thought about I could smash my skull on the edge of the pool hard enough so that I would knock myself out and drown, or how I wish, how I begged that I had a gun and could just shoot myself in the fucking head. I eventually had the nerve to walk out on the party while some of my mates asked where I was going, or that they did not want me to leave. Staying at that party would have done far more harm then good I estimate, in fact I **know** it would have made me more depressed on the walk home then I already was going to be as I walked home. Why cannot I just be normal like everyone else, is it because I am an only child who spent 90% of his childhood staring at the wall or watching TV on his own because no one was ever home? Is it because I was a fat little fucker throughout the entirety of primary school, and how being picked on for being a fat cunt has subconsciously impacted by self-esteem? Or was it that time in 2019 when I got completely dacked doing a pullup on the oval infront of the entire fucking school? (I was already a social anxiety-having fucking retard back then.) Holy shit typing this just feels good man, wow. Do I have asperges? I do not fucking know. Do I have social anxiety? I do not know. Am I just shy? I do not know. Do I have depression? I do not know. I hope I do not but I kind of hope I do at the same time so I have a reason to be so mentally fucking defective. All I know is that I have fantasized about killing myself since I was a 10 year old, and NoFap has merely granted me more time to think about how badly I just want to kill myself. How bad I just want to buy a gun, or join the army and just shoot myself in the fucking skull and just obliterate my existence from this Earth. On that note, I am not like most people who say they have ""Given up on humanity"" and how they are ""turning their back on humanity"". Because I am not angry at society or humanity, I know I am the issue, I am the defect. I am so lonely and I love this solace, this hole that I am in, this melancholy. It feels warm, cozy, it feels like I belong here and it feels like I am here to stay. I do not give a fuck anymore, I just want to die. Maybe I will regret it when I do kill myself one day. I am just so tired of being an autistic little fuckup loser. Sometimes when I get mad at myself or I feel stress, I just like to rant in my head how I am so much a fucking fat little cunt f\*ggot fucking loser, it feels good. Sometimes I like to pretend I am holding a gun to my head (or in my mouth) with my hand and just pretend I am pulling the trigger and that I will not be here anymore. I remember when I was a little younger, I used to go sleep, making a prayer (Eastern Orthodox) and just pray that god will kill me or end my life. I am just listing my thoughts here so if this feels a little disjointed, I apologise. I just wish I could be normal, I wish I did not hate the very existence of my being, my body, my stupid ugly fucking face. I wish I could look people in the eye while I talk to them. I wish I could talk to people. I wish I could talk to girls, I wish I could feel **not** lonely. I have done research on how to do those things, and it just brings me back to where I started. 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Just read that, kind of liked how I brought it full circle. I know other stuff about helping my social anxiety and stuff, people say just talk to people or talk to strangers, even just shallow talk etc. and it will get easier. Sure maybe it might, but I do not want to have to try man, I am so fucking sick of having to strive to be average instead of just 'being average'. I do not want to try, I just want to kill myself and not have to bother, just give up. Some of you reading that message above might be a bit smug and say, 'then do it, nothing is stopping you, just do it, you are just going to be another statistic.' Do you really think I care about being another statistic? If I had a gun, I would have already killed myself lmao. I would probably be dead in the pool or on the couch, I do not fucking know. I am listening to some Radiohead and just writing these things while putting on a good album of their just feels right. I will wrap it up here, how the fuck are people cocky? How are people arrogant or become overconfident? I want that shit man, surely it is better than every thought you have in your brain is either a plea for suicide or a neutral thought which manifests itself into a negative one. Anyways, that is all I can think of for now in my smug retarded essay. Comment what you guys think or something so I know my block of text did not go unnoticed. Or even advice, I dunno, I have not **totally** given up yet. Thanks guys. Self Esteem - Kind of just listing things to get off my chest",0
"Hi, I hope everyone is doing well,I am just really struggling right now. No need to dive into it but I have been SH free for a about 6 months and I really do not want to fall back into it although I am just dying to. The relief and peace I feel during is like nothing else, but as soon as the realization hits, I feel SO ashamed and stupid (and scared for some reason) So if you have anything that helps and REALLY works to distract from doing it, please share if you feel like it.

"I really should sleep I have work in a few hours but half of me just feels like quitting. I do not want to say I am feeling suicidal but if I could just not wake up again i would. I do not feel rational at all and i recognize that but it does not help. I am overly concerned with everyone is opinion of me and it sounds insane because actual strangers not seeming happy enough at work or not getting a response on something i post just overwhelms me. I feel like a child again. I did not get the place I wanted to move into and it feels so personal. I know its not really? But it does not help, I have this underlying feeling my roommates hate me and my room will be the worst and Ill get there and hate it all. Its not even two months now I am moving 6 hours away and I do not even want to.Nothing really makes me happy anymore I just want the pain to stop. This is what happened last time I just could not deal with it. I do not know what is wrong with me but I am not even sure I care to treat it. I think I just want to sleep and never wake to deal with it all. Genuinely I think what is stopping me is the fear failure like god if I failed and had to face everyone after that I could not deal with it.I am wide awake and i wish i was not. i do not want to get graphic but i did a number on my leg and i cannot even feel it anymore i cannot feel anything and i know its just in my head i mean i do not know I am too tired to do anything but i cannot calm down enough to sleep. I really do wish I could see it through. feeling lost",1
I feel so much guilt for I did something unforgivable. There is no other way out. Its for everyone is benefit. I have to kill myself. Today.,1
"Todays been especially hard, but it comes in waves. I want to kill myself, not neccesarily because I feel like everyone hates me, but more that I just feel like life is just a game of suffering or pretending. I visited some friends at school and everything just seemed so superficial and I felt disconnected from it, and honestly was expecting something different because I have felt disconnected from everywhere else. After a traumatic event back in the fall I have not been the same since and I just struggle trying to figure out the reason for life, and get worried that all it is is suffering until death. Its hitting especially hard today. I do all that I can, I am on medication, see a therapist, work a decent job, exercise, spend time with family and friends, and at this point i have no sense of self, and just do not want to carry on. I am 21 years old and already have been so uncomfortable with how life has been panning out, and just thinking about the future is extremely discouraging. Please anything helpful that has helped get out of this headspace would be so appreciated Does it ever go away",1
"I do not like my life, I do not like society, I do not like the future that is awaiting us and I do not want to live anymore. If I did not have family I would kill myself, but since I know they would blame themselves for the rest of their lives I sadly do not feel the freedom to do that. Over the last years I have been increasingly isolating myself from the world, often not answering phone calls/texts etc. because I just do not see the point in doing anything if at the core of my beliefs I do not see the point in living. Some facts about me: I am male, 29, pretty healthy, have a university degree, get by fincancially, live in one of the best places in the world and had a decent childhood/upbringing. My feelings are not an emotional reaction but rather a (rational) conclusion, formed over the years.I really do not want to go to therapy, I have tried it twice. It makes me feel like this life is even more useless if I need to work my ass off just to be able to afford therapy so that they can ask me fancy questions, tell me to meditate or to medicate so everything might get a little bit more bearable.**TL;DR:** I just do not want to live! But I also do not want to be the asshole that messes up other lives by killing myself. What can I do? I am in despair, what can I do?",1
"I understand the whole it will get better and better times are ahead spiel. Hell, I have told my also-suicidal friends that same shit as a piss-poor attempt of trying to convince them not to do it. But the easy retort to that, at least for me, is that every good moment is followed by just a damn shitty existence. Every time, without fail. And every time, that good thing, that everyone says you should stick around for, was not fucking worth it.Okay, it will get better. But it sure as hell will not stay that way. Sure, it gets better, but then it goes right back to being fucking awful.",1

"Hate. Hate is too kind a word for the detestability I self-inflict upon myself. I am a traitor in my own mind. Wanting to betray my heart and usurp the throne. I have purloined my soul and left it an empty vessel. I take heed not of my salvation, for I do not fear death; I fear life more than and mercenary. It is a cruel and unjust bishop that shall condemn me to a purgatory of an unpayable debt I shall never reimburse. I shall not yield, I shall be my own executioner. However, I will fight, kick and scream. I will writhe like a woman in labour. Until this fateful day shall I meet this hooded apparition? Will he embrace me as kin, or shall I be burned in a pit of unending torment? I am the last soldier on the precipice of hope. I shall defend the unending hoard. I shall clad myself with the armour of a steely stubborn will, Greaves to protect my falling ambition into a chasm of inhibition, and I shall wear a pair of form-fitted yet Gaped Gauntlets to wield my blade of desperation. I will fight until my inevitable damnation. I am endowed with eternal hate, this I know...is my fate. A pessimist is just a disappointed optimist (vent poem)",0

"Paradoxically, all I want is to do is to not have to do stuff. Like not having to work, which is honestly one of the biggest reasons I hate living. Any job whatsoever is hell, every single job.But you are forced to work 8 hours a day (or even more) to survive, for bills and food and such. Torture, especially if you are doing it just to not be homeless.I just have NO reasons to live. Only reason I did not off myself is because I do not want to make my parents suffer, or my cat. And I will not ever off myself, do not have it in me to do that. I guess many years of anhedonia since a relatively young age does this to you. I wish I could just lie in bed all day at least, but no, I have to endure torture for so many hours a day by having to work. Every second is torture. At this point, I am not even sure I am depressed anymore.

"disclaimer: i do not take antidepressants and i do not think ever will. i do not want to intermingle any ssri, snri or others alike with my current medication, adderall, due to concomitant risk factors.i feel like I am in a state of inertia i want to strive far and make progress in many different fields, and I am confident, but i do not take the steps to further reach my goals.I am 19 years old. just 12 months ago, i got my first job at petco. the experience was great i can proudly say i had a strong beneficial impact on both my peers and the people id meet on a daily basis. i was a very bubbly kid, a yes-man with a smiling face, willingness to see each of my peers have a better day, and loved to perform beyond expectations.unfortunately, the store ended up losing people, and those that remained turned lax. i eventually alternated from animal care and occasional stock-work to full-time at the register alone eight hours a day. this schedule quickly turned me into a robot, marred my social enjoyment, and stressed me out. what made matters worse is that my boss wanted me to force customers to sign up for our rewards program i would always ask them, list the positive facets and whatnot, but there would always be people that just wanted to get there stuff and book it, and a lot that would get angry at me. i did not force people because i did not want to look more like an advertisement drone. the stress impacted my respiration, heart rate, caffeine consumption and sleep. to keep from saying much more of it, i disappeared early into may without notice.since i quit, I have been playing the same video game (overwatch yeah i know) for at least 6 hours a day, sometimes up to 12. i love it, and i find myself most content when i play it, primarily because I am really good at it. after about a month of routinely doing this, i started to think about how i have even less of a life than i did when i was practically a vapid husk at petco.my room is big. adjunct bathroom and everything. extremely comfy bed, relaxing strip-lights, tranquil fan breezes... every person that has stepped foot in here has loved it. maybe its too comfy.my med stack is stupid-big. its mostly composed of nootropics and micronutrient supplements:- dextroamphetamine / amp. salts (adderall)- 5-htp- st. johns wort- ashwagandha- l-tyrosine- n-acetyl cysteine- sarcosine- vitamins b6, b12 and d3- ginkgo biloba- omega-3- magnesium cl. hexahydrate (topical)- l-theanine &amp; gaba- calcium carbonate (tums)my diet is awful. i eat pizza, pb&amp;j and fast food. i wish i ate fish and nutrient-rich foods, i really do. there is just something in me that tells me i will never eat it.i got my permit when i was 16. i tried driving back then, but eventually just stopped wanting to sometime before i turned 18. I am just scared to.i want to spend time with my friends and enjoy it, but after an hour of doing so i often end up wanting to isolate and tackle boring statistics or learn about some ridiculous topic just to do something.i wanted to go to college for pharmacology. my knowledge on the subject broadens every day, and i employ it to help people as much as i can and its worked.i used to listen to music. now i skip 80% of the tracks in my playlist. i used to feel butterflies within me when i spent time with my girlfriend, but even though i love her with every last fiber of my being, it does not feel the same.i have a novel presently with ~50k words. i love my literary tongue, and i would love to pursue it, but i just do not.all i do is play that one video game and read.is anybody else amid an inertia like this? any kind of comment would make me feel good.

"Hi. First off, I am really sorry to put this on whomever is reading this right now. I am not feeling great and I think I just need to feel reassured that I am. Not going mad. I do not have any friends who are likely awake to turn to and its honestly a sensitive matter. I went out with my wife and a friend of hers this evening. During the course of the night the friend revealed that my wife had spoken to her and been less than complimentary about the attractiveness of my ass.A little hurtful, considering she is normally complimentary about it to my face, but no big deal, right? I mean, nobody is perfect.However, when I raise the point that it is not a particularly nice thing to hear, I am met with ""Well I only said that because..."" essentially making it my fault.This hurt. Like... I feel completely invalidated. she is essentially taken how I feel and dismissed it, even turning it around to make it somehow my fault that she made the comment in the first place.Since then (about 2 hours ago) I have been thoroughly distressed and honestly having to resist the urge to self harm, biting my fingers and slapping myself, etc.she is now asleep and I honestly do not know what to do. I feel awful and honestly betrayed at the response I have received but at the same time stupid for being so hurt over something so seemingly trivial. Am I over reacting?

"The only thing i keep myself alive for is self pityful hope in therapy. I am extremely irresponsible, often skip meds and do not bring test results on time. Obviously, they are not working. My therapist and I do not have chemistry and I ever only had a slither of hope when she was confident in my first diagnosis during my first session. I have seen her numerous times and tried various medication but nothing seems to work, even when I take it responsibly but I guess i do not endure enough long. I am sabotaging my own promise. Most recently I was on olanzapine, aripiprazole and eftil. She proposed to try lithium salts but, obviously, i skipped the necessary tests because of how much of a failure I am.I have nothing else to try for. I will talk to her one last time and if nothing promising happens, that is it. I promised before ending it all to give one last pityful attempt to therapy, and its not working.",0
"I do not care what anyone says, for some people their is no hope in life. I have accepted that I am going to be miserable for the rest of my life. Why? Chronic depression, social anxiety, bdd, agoraphobia, and extremely low self-esteem is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life. I have already accepted I am never going to get a girlfriend. I am not working anymore because I do not see the point in making money when nothing even makes me happy. I do not find pleasure in anything I do. Everything feels like a goddamm chore. I am tired of getting drunk then waking up feeling even more miserable. I am tired of everything. I hate my life and want out. it is not going to get better",1
"tired tired tired tired3$ in the bank and no family to borrow from. rent and bills coming due - guess ill just let them gono job, no prospects, hell cannot even get out of bed some days. lost money doing the one thing i could stand doing because i got greedy and now I have got nowhere to go.just not made for thiswanna end it to stop the struggle. four years ago i tried and fucked myself up bad in the process. i do not want to keep fighting this fucking fight. Hungry And Tired And Miserable",1
"Why I am like this. Just why. I am lazy and I spend my days doing nothing productive. I am extremely selfish. I am stupid. I hate myself so much that I beat myself causing me pain whenever I do a mistake even in video-games which are my escape from reality.I hate my family. They are a bunch of know-it-all jerks. My sisters are like ""try to make more friendships IRL, it is easy!"" as it they were me in the first place, plus many of their friendships are plain terrible. I may have had less friends than them, but at least none of them harmed me as much as their friends harmed them. In recent months I realized that up to when I became eight years old my parents and my older sister were abusive towards me and they are acting like nothing happened. I often fear that whenever I do something bad I would get beaten by one of my parents. I sometimes whish they would just get back what they deserve. Lastly I hate humanity. Among all the species in the planet why did I have to born in the dumbest. A deer who just leaves to eat grass to than be eaten by a wolf is living a better life than 99% of humans. We are put in a rat race no one really wants to take part in. And that 1% not only is a super-selfish group of men living better at the expense of other humans, but at the expense of the planet. Most humans celebrate them as smart, but if they were really that smart they would find a way to live that life without hurting other humans and the planet. The truth is they are just born rich and so selfish that they would do anything to have more money. But also everyone would do everything for more money just yesterday I came across a dude who faked being deaf to ask money for a charity and I was falling for it. I hate myself, everyone around me and humanity",1
"I find it hard to say how I am doing, for the most part I just say I am okay. If I say I am notI just do not go into detail. I feel like they will not get it at all. Or they will think I am simply being dramatic. That its simply just a feeling/phase that will pass. Or that I just have to take some sort of action and do shit different. Its the advice I have gotten before. I do not want advice for the most part. I just want someone to actually listen and understand I guess. Do you find it hard to tell those around you that you are struggling?",0
"Have been feeling depressed for quite a while. A lot of it has to do with my future goals and career, just general anxiety and fear for the future. Will be entering college this fall and sorta feel weird about life. I have friends from hs but we do not really talk and I do not really have anyone in my life to talk to, or want to talk to. I am just overall very neurotic about my future career. Ill be going down a very difficult and long career path that I believe objectively is one of the hardest ones out there (medicine). I have been working really hard to get opportunities and building up my resume and stuff. While I am doing stuff I do like, I do not feel happiness in life. There really is not anything that brings me joy. I also feel bad about my body. Sometimes I look at old photos and feel really bad about how I have gained weight. I have struggled with an ED before but I do not have ed issues anymore, but it does not stop me from feeling bad about myself. And yea I just do not really feel anything, and I do not know if I want to seek professional help. Like overall I feel like the road ahead is going to be very difficult and tiring and I just want a break but I feel like I have not been working hard enough as I have been doing a lot of comparing myself with others lately.Just wanted to get this all off my chest. Just want to write it out",0
"Guys, I have been thinking a lot lately. About myself, and I am certain I hate myself because I am autistic. I feel like I have no future because of that because I am not smart. I have wasted my time filling my head with pop culture info instead of stuff that could get me a job and be financially stable. But because I am autistic, I feel it would be better if I just kill myself. Autism sucks",0
"I am 20. I do not understand why I am alive, to be honest. I do not have any intention of killing myself, but I find it hard to care about anything these days. And from what I can tell, life itself seems meaningless overall. Not to be nihilistic or anything, but I genuinely see no reason to even keep going. Most of the time, I do not feel anything besides ""meh."" or I seem apathetic. I am content being alone, and I am the kind of person who is happy as long as I have any kind of something around me to entertain myself with. As it currently stands, my depression seems to have taken a nosedive. I have not showered in 3 days, because I do not feel like it. We also do not have any hot water, at the moment, and so if I do shower I have to do it in the stupidest way possible and I do not even feel clean afterwards. Basically I was taught when this happens, boil water, mix it with some cool water, pour it in sink, and use a washcloth to wipe yourself down. Stupid, and takes way more effort than a regular shower. And I do not feel like taking a cold shower. And I mean realistically, if I died tomorrow, nobody would notice for a long time. Not even work because I work minimum wage, and they would just assume I would quit or something. My grandparents do not need me. My parents do not care where I am, or what I am doing, they are busy raising my siblings or getting high. it is been like that since I was a baby though. My grandparents would find my body, if I were to die, and probably be sad, but I feel like that is only because of the fact they raised me. They would actually benefit if I was gone, seeing as to how often they complain about how miserable their life currently is. How broke they are, ect. I feel like I do not really exist, except to make them happy, because I am always their emotional support child. They argue and yell all the time. Just this morning, my grandpa decided to start an argument because my grandma grabbed the wrong bowl. She said she wished she had never left my aunts house(She went to visit last week), and my grandpa said he wished she stayed too. Then of course, she comes into my room crying, then she makes my favorite meal, then comes to announce that she made my favorite meal, and then let us herself into my room to make my bed. This stuff is her way of trying to make herself feel better, it is not out of genuine love I do not think. Because if I am in a bad mood, and I do not immediately perk up, it must be her fault and she will start crying even more. there is no escape from the negativity. I have to fake my happiness, obviously, because her feelings depend on mine. I hate it, and there is no escape from the negativity.I mean, I found roommates that hopefully I will be moving out with soon. But even then, I am not sure life will get any better. Because I am pathetic enough, that most people think there is something wrong with me and see me as a walking red flag. I am of course, poor as well, so you know, add that onto it. But I have been saving up my money. I just do not know what to do with any of it. I have been saying I want to go to college, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I do not know why I would go to college yet, I do not want to waste my money on something I might never use or might not even like. There are a lot of people out there who view me as a loser, because I smoke weed, play video games, work, and am not in college. To add onto that, everyone acts like you should strive to ""better yourself""But in my opinion, I am not sure what I should better about myself. Or why. To make it so I am more tolerable to you? Because if I do not see you putting in the same effort, why would I put in all the work so you can freeload? If that makes sense. I mean, I am just here to vent at the moment. But I am not really upset. Or sad, even. I am not sure what I am feeling, but it is neither hopeless nor hopeful. I do not see a reason to keep going",0

"After having worked on myself so hard and getting back in contact with him, things were going wonderfully. I fixed so much of the problems that caused issues in our relationship. We were meeting every week and slowly getting closer again. Until last night.Of course I could not control my drinking at the bar and of course I had to start a fight with him. I do not even remember what I did or told him, but it was enough for him to say he does not care about me anymore and never wants to talk to me again. The one thing I remember is begging him to please tell me why this was happening and to not leave. He took back his apartment key from me and gave me back mine. it is over for good. The one person I have ever loved is gone and it is all my fault.I feel like such a failure for having lost control of my drinking. I am such an idiot for ruining the second chance I got. I love him so much and I failed him as a boyfriend not once, but twice. Now, I just want to end it all. I have to end it all. I just cannot continue knowing that I set myself on this path. Knowing that I broke his heart.I do not know when I am going to do it, but I know it is going to be soon. I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts and the biggest regret I have always had was not going through with my suicide back when I was a teen. All of this pain could have been avoided if I had just gone through with it.I do not care if there is anything after death.

"I have been thinkin on writin here for months.I have been having suicidal thoughts for years, they get stronger at times, n they are back extremely strong right now. Nothing seems to make sense. I know everyone hates me. I know the world would be either a better place without me, or nothing would change. I do not know if I want to keep on going anymore. I hate myself so much, and the thought that I only annoy people makes me want to die even more.I tried joining groups of interests to make myself stay alive. Because I have to. Because others need me. But I do not feel like I fit anywhere. there is always someone better than me. Of course. I am nothing special in the end anyway.I both want to die very much but also am scared of death. I feel so pathetic feeling this way. I do not know what to do anymore. Nothing seems to help as I seem to always get back into this state. No matter how hard I try. I just wish I was better. But i do not know how I could even do that. I also do not know what I am trying to do by writing all of this n posting it here. I just do not know what to do anymore. I feel so lost. I feel so many things at once yet nearly nothing at all. Its all just so confusing and I feel so alone in this. I do not want to bother anyone either. I hope writing this will not turn out bad or anything.I just do not know what to do. Maybe all I really needed was to let it out somewhere? I do not know. I just wish I could end this all.",1

"Hello,Decided to keep myself occupied by working 75 hour shifts at my job &amp; get my money up. Been putting my debt aside for awhile now &amp; I have come to terms that I cannot let it go on like this. Baby steps for me to become healthy, I need to be financially free. My main goal in life is to be free. I do not want to feel chained, I do not want to feel like I have any ties with this planet, &amp; to do so I really need to discipline myself, but before that I need to play catch up.

"Over the last year I attempted to switch jobs and was let go from my new position due to my ex gf making a false statement about me online. I moved away with my girlfriend, cannot find work and cannot afford to pay my debt. I have sold everything I own to make ends meet. I have handed out 1000s of resumes, and I have a lot of experience and certificates in trades and engineering but I think what my ex said about me previously is preventing me from screening. We recently relocated and my girlfriend found employment. My car mirror was vandalized and my insurer will not be covering the repair it seems, so I cannot drive to work. I have dealt with depression, anxiety and suicide before, but never this bad. I had to pay a bailiff to not repossess a car I cannot even drive. I am selling things I love like my cameras and guitars. I have truly lost everything and now I am fearful of losing my partner. I love her so much and its so hard for me to even think about but I am not sure what to do. I have income assistance but even that and her job is not enough to cover costs.I never thought Id be this low. I am not sure what the universe is trying to tell me. I am clean and sober, I do not smoke, I treat every person I meet with respect and I am always there to help. I hate seeing my girlfriend cry and I am not sure what else I can do at this point. As a human and a young man I feel defeated. I cannot handle anymore staffing companies or interviews that lead nowhere, pay next to nothing or have 250 applicants. It seems like I cannot get a break. My last option is to move home to my mothers but there is other factors that make that less than desirable for my partner. I really do not know what there is left to do. I went from having. A house, cars, everything... the last thing I am scared to lose is her. I love her so much. I think I am done for",0

I have diagnosed of depression last week. Taking anti-depressants right now just makes me weak but plus to that I do not feel like doing what I have to do. I want to go out instead and have fun. Is it normal? Thanks in advance Hey depressed fellow here just want to know if it is normal that I am not feeling like reviewing for my exams and that I just want to get out and be around people all the time,0
"The biggest why: Even though I am a good student in college, I feel cannot understand a science clearly.

I have three reasons for committing suicide.",1
"I have been badly depressed my whole life. Or at least gloomy. My parents were always nicer and favored my sister. They were usually more attentive and lenient to her. Her life has gone pretty well while my life has genuinely has nothing going for it.I was not a good student, i got into a community college and had to drop out due to injury. I have always had bad legs, my knees always buckled and my feet do not point straight and it always made it hard to walk. Since i was little. it is led to my falling a lot and having resulting injuries. 2 dislocations, a broken ankle and i broke my kneecap. The last injury was horrific, i had to drop out of college, walk in braces for over a year, 3 surgeries, wheelchairs and walkers. I am a burden on my family with all my health problems. I do not have insurance and have no money.I have always had weight problems. I suffer from obesity, always have been since i was 8. I know what and what not to eat, but nobody to push me to do it. I give in to bad food more often then i like to admit. I cannot make myself stick to diet. And i cannot exercise because of the disabilities, i also just do not have the drive. I cannot even stand for 10 minutes wihtout getting fatigued. I want to but i cannot push myself to do it. I feel myself getting bigger, i thought i could finally exercise when my family got a pool but i cannot get in. it is just above my hip and i cannot get in, I am scared to death of ladders, i cannot step over the side. I really want in but i cannot. I think my years of being obese are starting to catch up to me, I would guess i probably do not have much time left anyway.On top of the weight are a myriad of other health problems I have been stuck with. I am not body confident because every man in the family is taller then me. they are all tall and I am way shorter, i even have small hands and feet. I feel like i have a kid's body. they are all multi talented, while i just cannot physically do anything. I cannot play sports, i cannot sing, i cannot dance or anything. The only thing going for me is that i know really random trivia from years of watching quiz shows.I cannot work so i live with my mom. I literally stay in bed all day. Sleeping, screwing around online and watching anime.I am also getting lonely, i have no friends, i talk to nobody. I have never hung out with a friend or texted a person. I also am still a virgin. I honestly do wish i could experience a relationship one time before i go. it is what I will regret most. But i knew it would not happen due to my looks in general, and my complete lack of social skills.I finally found a community that accepted me. r/waifuism, i have a waifu, since i was a kid i had a crush on a female anime character, i knew a real relationship was not going to be a part of my life, so i embraced the waifuism. 6 months I have been posting on there and they banned me out of nowhere. That was a heavy blow, for months I have regularly been contributing to this page and it was the closest i had to real friends and i suddenly got banned.I cannot stick to anything. Even simple things like writing fanfiction or making YouTube videos. I have had stories I have posted a chapter to on hold for years. I regret doing that, i do not even have an excuse, i just quit. I have 0 drive to do anything. I do not even know what I would want to do if i could work. I have thought about becoming a VA but i do not have the drive. it is my dream, since I have always liked cartoons. I know I will regret that and not finishing the fanfic's. But that is it. The closest thing for me is that i want to meet my idol, a woman who I have been a fan of for years and who voiced some of my favorite anime characters. She left an impact on my childhood, I would want to meet her and thank her for that.The only thing that is really stopping me is my grandmother. I love her to death and losing me would completely devastate her. She already lost 1 son, he died of cancer a few years back. A lifetime of loneliness and health problems, along with just having nothing to live for.",1
"Got in a big argument with my parents because I forgot to do something (very petty too)They kept saying that I am selfish, I spend too much time with my online friends and that I do nothing productive despite working from 12 md to 9 pm almost every single day while simultaneously being a college student.I felt like I had everything going for me: decent paying job, a good major, a healthy relationship, great friends and helped with the bills. It seems like it is never enough. I am so tired of this. I cannot move out either, rent is extremely high due to covid and I have no other relatives who want to take me with them.Already made cuts in my arms (not the horizontal ones either) and I am hesitant as to whether or not I should overdose on cough medicine. Something is stopping me despite losing it.My boyfriend is trying to help me and I think I am mainly stopping thanks to him but I see my sanity slowly drifting away. I feel horrible right now",1
"If one more person tells me that I need to ""fight"" my laziness I am going to actually explode. I have experienced being able to get up and be productive and do things that I may not necessarily want to do. But that is because it was doable. It feels like to do the things I want to do I have to scale Mt. Kilimanjaro. Even if I just to brush my teeth on non-work days because no one is dependent on me. I swear I can fight but I cannot fight this hard every day just to do something I will enjoy. Is it supposed to be this fucking hard?",0
"Know that if you die today, you pet would not know what is going on. They would think that you left them.

"I know I am not ok. Yet I cannot help but wonder now with the media constantly telling us that depression is real and is crippling so many people out there, its becoming this massive self fulfilling prophecy for the whole of society. I show just an ounce of self pity and self deprecation and I can instantly feel the compassion and pity and sympathy from the other person. It feels weird. I feel like I use it as a tool of manipulation for times when I know I could have done better. For times when I know I did not step up and pull my weight. Yet I feel so dead on the inside I have no motivation to even tidy my flat or feel the need to achieve anything ever f*king again. I feel too far gone as if I can never ever be truly happy again. I wish I did not grow up with social media and unrealistic expectations. I feel like my mind has been poisoned and there is no antidote that can fix it. The path to healing seems so overwhelming and long I just cannot be f*kd. The road to inner peace and happiness seems impossible. I do not feel the need to be better anymore. I cannot be bothered with my appearance, my career, friends or dating life. I am just waiting to die. I do not want to tell the few close friends that I have how I am truly feeling. I do not want to bring them down or have them worry. I do not want their pity. I do not want to tell my family. At the end of the day its up to me whether I want to improve my life or not. I just feel so dead on the inside. I am not ok. do not know what to do. But is depression even real tho",0

"I feel like human garbage. I believe everything hateful anyone has ever said about abusers right now. I am thinking about ending my life at the end of the week.I have been in this for a while. I have dealt with the ebbs and flows, but this one feels different. I abused my daughter over a decade ago. Through my arrest, incarceration, therapy, 12 steps, and a fuck ton of self reflection I thought I was something different. I thought maybe I was not the things I had done. Maybe I could be someone new. I had re-dedicated my life to trying to make things right in the world.I thought, my daughter and I have grown much closer through this time. I have acknowledged the pain I caused, and tried to make amends in the best ways I can. I thought we had several good conversations. However, after what I thought was a very good conversation, I got a glimpse of her private SC story yesterday. ""Being vulnerable with your abuser sucks. Suck my dick MFr. I literally fucking hate you.""She does not know I saw it, I am not sure if I should even bother saying anything or if saying something is just manipulative, because it was not meant for me to see.I am fucking lost. I feel like this is all for naught. If I cannot recover the relationships that mean the most to me, why even be here, why go through this. Clearly, everyone is just going to hurt anyways. Everyone would be better off, just being able to move past me and forget. The world may truly be a better place if I just leave it this weekend. TW",0

"I am officially done being nice. From now on I am going to to be an asshole, jerk, selfish and I am not going to help others if I do not want to, care about others, or do the things I do not want to anymore. I used to think that being nice was the way to like correctly, but oh boi, was I wrong. People are assholes and they live better than I do and they seem to be carefree, so now I will do the same. Being a good guy has literally gotten me nowhere In life, I thought I would have much more to show by now, but nope.I guess I will see how this goes, cannot really go anymore downhill from here. Being kind, caring, compassionate, and a ""nice"" person has gotten me nowhere",0
"I am a mom and wife to two beautiful boys and husband. It all started with insomnia due to going back to school, getting covid and trying to homeschool. I got horrible anxiety and stopped sleeping so I tried several sleeping pills to no avail which led to a prescription of Lexapro and Temazepam. The Lexapro sent me into a spiral and after 5 weeks I had to stop it and have had horrible side effects and am now trying to taper off of Temazepam. I do t know which symptoms are from which drug withdrawal but I have reacted so horribly to theses drugs I dream of only having insomnia again. Week after week things never get better. I am anxious, suicidal, and have all kinds of strange symptoms that Dr.s do not understand or want to prescribe more drugs for. I am afraid the meds have caused permanent damage even in the short time I have taken them, and now its like being trapped in hell. I can barely care for myself let alone my kids. Suicide seems like the only way out. I cannot put them through this anymore. But I do not want to die.

"I want to start by saying I do not have clinical depression. Everything is just falling apart, and I cannot handle it. My situation is fucking screwed, and when I try to make it better, it seems I only make it worse.I want to die, really. I have wanted to end it all for years, but have been holding on to one thing after the next. Now, I have got a daughter I am trying to be there for. she is the only thing keeping me here at this point.I am in denial about things, and I am like aware of it, but I feel like it is worth being in denial. it is not like I cannot handle the alternative, but I just do not want it. I know that if it comes to it, I will just keep on going, but God damn do I want this.You know, the worst part is I finally set myself up for therapy when I finally hit rock bottom. I am still at rock bottom, but since that day I put in the paperwork/application(last Thursday, today is Wednesday), it can take up to 3 weeks to even get the clinician. I cannot handle what is going on in my head for another two weeks, and then wait to even meet the person, and get fucking help.I started whipping myself with a belt again, which I had not done since 2018. This time, I upgraded to the buckle. My back is incredibly bruised, and sore. But I like looking at it, and I like feeling it in the moment. It makes me feel clear, and like I am being punished for all the fuck ups. I feel like I deserve it. I tried to earlier, but got stopped, because I said something I should not have because I was not thinking.And I am so fucking selfish. Since shit hit the fan, I have been focused on myself instead of what happened(which was to someone else).. But they do not want to talk to me about it, so I am stuck. I ask questions about things that have a concern to me. But this person is the only person I can even ask! I cannot ask someone who does not understand the situation, and I cannot ask the person who does, so what do I do with these feelings and concerns? The only thing I can think of is just punishing myself for even feeling.Fuck, if I could I would go right now and beat the shit out of myself. I am perpetually fucking up. I try to work on things, and then continue to make things worse. I feel like a bull in a China shop, but the bull keeps trying to put the broken plates back on the shelves. I cannot fucking handle it",0
"Nobody give two shits about people who bring no value to them. This is something we as suicidal people know the most about. Everyone, including in some cases, parents (in my case at least), do not give two flying fucks about you, your presence, or your life, unless your value outweighs the mental costs that they have to ""undergo"" to be around you. however, the second you show any negative emotion, they are the first ones to shit on you, to belittle you, and negate all resemblance of emotion, because they would rather believe their made up reality, rather than understand the truth.What kind of a shitty person would rather kick you to the curb, in order to save face, rather than help when something goes wrong.My mother has openly stated that she only had me when she found out I was a boy, because of her being the youngest of her siblings, and that she was the one who bore the first grandson to my grandfather (we are an Indian family who moved to the US before I was born, they had me and my brother, then we moved back because my father had died), and apparently that was a big deal to my grandfather.Its got me so fucked up, that I literally feel the need to justify my existence by picking up skills that will be useful in the future (I am good with computer, I tinker with linux a lot, and I can disassemble and reassemble a laptop).What kind of parent justifies this but saying that it is right to own me simply because I was born to her.

"i just turned 47 today. I have relapsed into a major depressive episode. the past 4 months have been the worst (mentally) ever. I have had bad major deep depressive episodes in my past. for years at a time. I have gone the SSRI route and been through therapy. I have been through CBT twice. I have practiced mindfulness/meditation.my birthday means nothing to me. I am just surprised I have lasted this long.i keep posting on reddit and reaching out to people in real life. it appears that no matter where i am physically, with friends, by myself, with family, I am disconnected. i do not want to think or feel. i no longer want any of this.i slept for maybe 2 hours a couple of nights ago. i had a nightmare that i was alone. i constantly think about suicide. i can barely distract myself. i have breakdowns every day.I am not working, hobbies are not enjoyable, i do not have a relationship (girlfriend). I am so far from being content.i have a plan. want to end it stream of thought",0
"I do not know why but I am constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I did not really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one did not really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just do not fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I have had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I could not cut. I kind of feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I cannot talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I am sorry if this was too long a read. I am Lonely",1

"I remember months ago, where when I was sad I used to cry so much all the time, think and cry, after my parents were gaslighting and manipulating me I would cry. Now I cannot. I do not know if this is weird to say, but I miss crying. I feel like I do not feel, if something happens good or bad, I do not react anymore, and if I do its usually anger. I do not care about anything anymore. I also feel invalidated, because my other depressed friend cries often and is upset even when they are out with me and I never do that. I never cry infront of anyone, or even at terrible things I do not, so i feel like i do not have it as bad, and maybe i am getting better, but i do not feel like i am, i feel like i am getting worse. What do i do? Numbness",0
"Often when I look up the symptoms of depression I see ""loosing intrest in things that previously brought joy"" as one of them. I cannot relate to this symptom. I have suffered with depression for so long that I cannot rember anything making me happy.I began to get depressed around middle school, I am 20 now. that is 10 years of severe depression. Those 10 years are a person's most important and formational ones. My depression robbed me of all of it. I cannot imagine what life is like without depression. At one point I even thought I had died and gone to hell because I was so miserable.I just wish I could have some happy memories but even in my happiest ones all I remember is a neutral and empty feeling. Is there anyone else who feels like they have lost themselves to this disease or am I being melodramatic. Everything warped by depression",0

"This whole year in the pandemic was terrifying, I have seen people die around me, even a family member, I am an introvert it is very hard to socialise with people, when everybody just cares for themselves and I felt pressured to do something with my life l, I am from India and and my parents expected a lot from me and even I was hopeful that I would achieve everything they want me to until this year now I just feel incompetent for everything I cannot score good marks, I do not have the physique i imagined I would work for and I do not even look like I belong outside (feel ugly coz I had to donate my hair with the death of my uncle now it is just wierd to look at myself in the mirror) all of that was just in my head the feeling of worthlessness and just being a disappointment for everyone and myself and then one day my father calls me and says that I am not ""trying hard enough for my future"" but I do not even see myself living another day here, he also said that I am not worth the money he is spending on my college education. When that feeling of worthlessness sunk in this year it was all in head and now I heard it from my father that I am infact, worthless. I am at a point where I do not want to kill myself (because I am not a coward and I do not want to my parents through that pain) but also would not mind if I died in some road rage accident today. The wierd thing is I was one of those competitive kids I was the one with the good scores and now I am just struggling to even understand, feel like I do not belong with the kids I used to study with. My dad is the not a bad person, he wants what is good for me but he also doens't believe in mental health issues and I have already made the mistake of opening up to someone about this and hoping they would understand instead it just made me not wanting to live another day. Worthless",0
"&gt;If its too long do not read .Ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but I have some questions which I do not want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when I start to get better with my ocd. I have two Questions. Anyone who can give a good answer thanks. Not just what I want to hear. But the truth. Because I am not planning on asking these questions ever again. And I want to know the real consequences of this sin. Its really important since it was singled out and I really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . First on the blasphemy of The Holy Ghost. I did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life. &gt; &gt;And as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled I think that is what he said. So when I realized I was angry at my life and was trying to do better. And I was not done with some habits I tried to promise God TO quit. I still had no real joy in my life and I promised to give up things I loved. Like certain music and foods. Also I was not very nice. Because I loved my family. But they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me, I tried to protect myself. So it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they would not feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me. &gt; &gt;Just to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. Mainly because I do not have any real friends or people who just like me. Only my siblings and parents. I have depended on them for a lot and that was where I went wrong. Trying to make them love things about me they just hated, and they basically shuned me. For an example this may be tmi. But just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. Once I had a pad. For periods. And you know not to flush them. &gt; &gt;So instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it will not leak or anything and so you cannot see it in the trash. Now I was feeling bad and did not want to get one. So I got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. Now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. And he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. And found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me. &gt; &gt;Then I said yeah that is mine. He said it was disgusting and that he did not want to see that. And then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. And like said it was gross and nasty and I looked at my mom and she was like what ever I am tired of you, and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and I said my hair is fine. Then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. Then he said Id be shocked if I saw you in heaven. Over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash. &gt; &gt;Think he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. that is like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was going to find doing that. So that is just a taste of what he does. Trust me I do not always complain about every minor inconvenience. Then I do not want to be ew because God is God and can say what he wants. But I have an older sister she is 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. And I kind of judged her tho I was only jealous of her because dad loved her so much. Like anytime my sister would come around Id love seeing her and my niece. &gt; &gt;More then all my siblings and mom. she is my half sister by the way/ only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. So that being said I still was jealous of her and it totally was not her fault. Now all this shit was in my head and I was bitter. and I kind of would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and I was angry at GOD AND MY FAMILY FOR WEEKS BLASPHEMYING AND STUFF BEING RUDE. And I decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz I blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. And then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk. &gt; &gt;But also it had one about ahloa and her sister and I knew that was for me tho I am not a whore. It was like this is the sins of your sister. And my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kind of selfish. But then he said init she is better then you. Like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you, and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. You know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better. &gt; &gt;And the other is care free and happy and does not care as much but some how ends up better then you and that is how this is God tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes I am. So that brings me to these questins like in my other post I do not like suprises I like to know things so I do not have to worry about them. I sont mind being told no I am not peter. But thinking your going to do or get something and then not is like not very good, and I know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the Bible more and listen so this is the question , this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called. &gt; &gt;And I hate being left out of stuff. Tho my dad says some in heaven will not go, now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. I just wanted to know since I called the holy ghost evil and also I um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you will see.. Dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. And that last one is as you all know this see I read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said I do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the Holy Ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin. &gt; &gt;So I also do not really want eteranal guilt so those are the only two questions thanks.

"it is been 5 or 6 years since I had depression. I take Xanax but the symptoms never seem to lighten. I am a South Korean student in 12th grade, thus preparing for college. I find it pretty hard to study with my symptoms - maintaining a 'average' grade not high enough for my goals but not low enough to give up. Adding up to the self hate I already have, I am becoming increasingly indifferent to lots of things. I used to be interested in quite a lot of subjects, but not anymore. Even the hobbies and friends are getting out of my attention. It feels like my brain is fogged, I cannot think clearly and keep zoning out. I do not want to live my future life since it is so - not fun. I do not find a reason to live. Is this because of depression or is it because I am just lazy and wasting my life?

For awhile now I have had a mix of an anxious and empty mood. Some days I feel better than others. I keep busy everyday with my job and hobbies. What bothers me is I have never been diagnosed with anything yet. I had an assessment and they felt it was anxiety at the time. I got a second opinion and same thing.

"Just wanted to share my experience here. I was not getting much better with SSRIS or bupropion.

And then realize I have not had them in a while. that is how I tell lamotrigine is really helping me.This is only one experience, and it does not mean this drug would help everyone.

"There was this guy I met a few wks ago. It started with a post I made on reddit. Not quite sure on which subreddit he found it. Anyway, his first message was, what took you so long. And the rest was i could say history but it only lasted for a wk or two. It was short, I know. But it was the happiest and the saddest that I have ever been. Hes a very funny guy. We talk/chat for hours and all we did was laugh. We make fun of each other, make fun of other people, share funny experiences, he makes me really happy. I could die laughing with our conversations. It was hilarious! And that made me like him so much. In between those conversations, he would sneak in some sweet nothings. Hes very malambing as what we say it. Though sometimes he would be such a bully too. Fast forward to the weekend of 4th of July. He was suddenly gone. No calls, no messages, no nothing. Only to find out that he was with his ex girlfriend. He said his family invited her cos they did not know yet that they have broken up blah blah blah. So after a few days of nothing, he messaged me and explained everything. He said that he has no plans on getting back with her, he does not love her anymore, and that he likes me and missed me so much and would make it up to me bigtime. In short, I forgave him. A few days after that, he was gone again. For the second time! And guess what, he was with the ex AGAIN. He told me that the ex needed him to accompany her dad to the hosp, blah blah blah. I mean it is not his responsibility anymore. does not she have other friends?! Again, they have already broken up. So I told her that I guess he still loves her and his exact words were not as much as I want to love you. Oh cmon, cut the bullshit!! Clearly, I was just a rebound. And that was the end of it.I was crying for hours. The whole day, I was just staring at the ceiling, crying. Thinking that maybe I do not deserve to be happy. Maybe I do not deserve anyone. Maybe I am just meant to be alone forever. I do not deserve to be loved. I have been in quite a lot of heartbreaks to made me think that way. I have been single for 5yrs and most of them ghosted me or just left me or someone even said that I am too much for him. And I think that is how I developed my depression and anxiety. I have been meaning to see a doctor but I always make an excuse of how busy I am at work and that I do not have time or anything. But now, I am finally going to see one, in a few days. I already made an appointment. I do not know how severe it is. But I hope I could make it through. Idk what to expect. Idk what is going to happen next.

"Never imagined posting something publicly on the internet. My depression started in my early childhood. In my family I was an unnecessary child. My twin sister always got the love from both of my parents. I swear my parents never even said ""I love you"" to me all I ever heard was ""why cannot you learn from your sister"". Even in their last day before they all died in a car crash while driving my sister to her dance lesson I remember my mothers last words were ""why do you keep wasting our time you will never achieve anything in your life"" when I accidently hit my sister with a ball while playing with our dog. After that I got adopted and my foster parents did not really care about me they just did that because they got paid for it. I was lucky to get to keep my dog because she was the only thing I had left. In school I never really had any friends I only had 1 sided friendships where I thought I had a friend but the other person did not think of me as his friend. I also got bullied in school for being adopted and being ugly. After 2 years of being adopted my dog started shaking weirdly and it was because of water in lungs some form of cancer or something I do not even know now but my foster parents took my dog away so she would not have to suffer from her incurable disease. I swear the day my dog died was the last time I had smiled in my life and it was 16 years ago. I work at a furniture factory because I was to depressed to keep studying. I worked hard everyday and then spent the rest of the day doing nothing. My apartment is always a mess because I never had a true friend that is why I never really worried about cleaning up. I always tried finding a friend during school years but I either got ignored or I became ""friends"" with people who just made me walk with them like a dog because they never talked to me and ignored my questions if I did not ask it like 10 times. People in work seem to avoid me as well but I am used to it since school years. I am now stuck in an endless cycle between work and home.The only thing I have ever wished in my life was to be loved atleast once by someone who understands me who would make me smile once more and would not ignore me like everyone else who think so fucking high of themselves. Writing this made me tear up a lot reminding me how shit life is and that the only way to fix it is by ending it. Every step I take leads me closer to suicide.",1

"I lost my dog two months ago. I let him out to run for a bit at night and never saw him again. He was a lively dog and in my place, it is normal to let your dogs out and run around the neighborhood. I always thought he would come back. I thought maybe he just found a female dog and do dog stuff, but days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months.Now I am lying awake in my bed, crying my eyes out at the painful realization - he is gone. And I ask myself, why? Why did I let him out that night? Why could not I just waited for him to come back instead of sleeping and expecting he will be back in the morning? Why did not I give him more love and care? Why did I complain about cleaning his pee and shit? Why did not I hold him more? Why did not I hug him more when it was clear he loved being petted by me? Why did not I treat him better? Why did not I make his short life better? I do not even have proper pictures of him...I have so many regrets, and the heavy pain I have in my heart is pulling me down. I have taken my meds but them seem useless at this moment.I can only pray and hope that if he is gone, he would be in a happier place with all the other dogs I have lost.it is easier to accept death when I saw it with my own eyes. It was easier for me to accept my other dogs' deaths when I managed to properly say goodbye and bury them.But this heavy feeling of not knowing where my dog is, if he is alive or not, if he is okay, if he is trying to come back home, and in the worst case scenario, if he suffered before passing away. It hurts not knowing what happened and probably never getting answers.Wherever you are, I hope you are at peace. I love you. I lost my dog and I feel like a useless human being",0

"I do not want to kill myself. I do not want to go through all of the motions and be dramatic and make myself more of a nuisance than I already have been this whole time.I wish I could just disappear and not have the guilt of knowing that I disappointed the only person that still cared about me.In that ideal world, I would just have not existed. Nobody would have known of me. Everything would go on in an orderly fashion and I could finally stop suffering.I feel so alone. I am so tired of this drawl that is my daily life. I feel like when my mom leaves for work tomorrow I might do something careless, I am both scared and do not care at the same time. it is complicated",1
"I should be happy that people count on me and that I am important but I am *not*. I wake up, go to work, go home, repeat. My husband does not work, he takes care of our apartment, so I am the only source of income, and I am making just *barely* enough to survive. If our rent increases again, we will end up homeless.(Husband not having a job is a whole other issue I do not feel like getting into tbh)I cannot enjoy hobbies anymore. I cannot do anything but just sit and watch TV, and even that feels overwhelming because there is so much content and never enough time to enjoy it.I have only actively started planning to kill myself once, and I called a helpline, and my husband hid all the meds we have because my plan was to OD. I have not quite gotten back to that state of desperation but I have thought so many times since then that things would be easier if I just...stopped.I am not going to hurt myself because I do not want to let my family and friends down. I do not want to hurt them by leaving.

"I am not quite suicidal, but I am not quite okay. I am I am limbo. I lay in bed, trying to sleep and I have so much anxiety about going to work. Numb from depression. My family wants to celebrate Christmas in July, and usually Christmas songs and movies give me that warm fuzzy childhood feeling. I feel void. I lay in bed, I do not want to face the day. I want to sleep. Stay in bed. I think if I die, my problems would go away. But at the same time, I do not want to die. I want to enjoy life. I sink to that level of borderline SI, but then I go back to thinking how I could improve my life.Today, I got a friend request from my cousin. you would think that would cheer me up. No. It made me more depressed and feeling useless. The reason? Three week ago, I sent her a friend request. No reply. No response. I assumed she just does not check her social media often. However, it occurred to me today. If she sent me a friend request, that means she declined my friend request 3 weeks ago. Otherwise, it would have said she accepted my friend request. That means, she must have felt guilty and friended me out of obligation. My own family does not care about me or my life. Her first instinct was to not friend me. I am lost. Any advice? I am in Limbo. Anyone Relate?",0

"I am 27M and I have been feeling depressed for as long as I remember, I cannot recall what it is like not feeling this way. However, I was never officially diagnosed. I have always said to myself I am just sad, lonely or whatever. Now I am scared to go. Scared that there is actually nothing wrong with me and this is who I am. Scared that I cannot be fixed and will be like this forever. Majority of depression stories have some kind of trigger, some kind of trauma. I had nothing, my childhood was fine, I was not bullied, no one died when was I young. These thoughts and feelings of sadness, numbness, apathy just slowly creeped over me and now have swallowed me whole. Things I used to enjoy no longer interest me. Things that I used to escape no longer help. Due to these feelings and my social anxiety I never developed any close friendships and/or romantic relationships. I keep wanting to talk to someone but there is no one really to talk to. And, hell, even if there was, I have no idea how to talk about this. At this point I feel like I will be alone till the end. And maybe that is for the better, no one deserves to be stuck with a loser like me. I let it get to this point, I do not deserve love, I am not owed anything. Anyway, I do not know why I wrote this. Just wanted to vent I guess. I am scared I am making it all up",0
I feel bad whenever I have to cancel stuff and come up with a dumb excuse. Sometimes I am just so sad that the thought of interacting with someone makes me want to vomit. It makes me look like I do not value the person or Id rather be doing something else but its just that I need to be alone. Every once in a while Ill just admit that I really do not feel like interacting but they will either push me to do so until I accept or just worry about me. Ahh man it just sucks I really hate canceling things but I just cannot do it,0
I am 26. I have so many things I hope to do - have kids- finish grad school- buy or build my dream house- grow old with my husband- travel more of the worldbut I also just think too often about not doing any of itcause not existing sounds so much better. Easier. Less stressful.I love living but it often feels like life does not love me how I need/want/wish for it to. Thanks for reading. If I am honest I never expected to live this long,1
It feels like my middle chest is tight. My heart feels like it is beating too fast. Sometimes it feels like it is hard to breathe. My eyes get really watery and it is hard to cry. Some days it feels like I just want to rip my chest open to make it stop. The first time it happened i was in dance class. I had that tight feeling in my chest and I just started crying I did not know what was wrong. After that I quit. I started losing interest in things I loved. Sometimes I would not even go to school and I started acting up. I would always be angry and that resulted in me and my mom having rocky relationship. She would ask me what is wrong with me I just would not know what to say. My freshman year I started seeing therapist. They wanted to give me medicine but my mom got upset and told them no. I am 18 now and I am tired of having this feeling. I have been trying to focus on getting my driver's license but it just feels like this a dark force is consuming my body. I cannot keep living like this. Can you feel your depression,0

"Sorry, I am unsure if this is the right subreddit to post. I already know I have all the goods: severe depression, adhd, anxiety, you name it. But today, after like 50 hours put into a game, something happened that caused me to waste/lose at least two hours worth of progress and it immediately made me lose interest and motivation to keep going. This happens all the time to me, in the sense of a small thing leading me into loss of a feeling of having something to do, loss of motivation, and then boredom that melts into depression. Where I then end up sitting around all day in bored, unable to convince myself to even bother trying another game (my only comfort hobby I have) or even get up. I hate feeling like this over small inconveniences, and I just do not know what I can do to get out of the funk until I find a new thing to hyper fixate on and distract me from being bored/depressed.

"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and chronic major depression. I am basically a crazy bridge burner during my episodes.

Now I am just done having a cry fest for an hour and telling myself I am a horrible human being and just wanting to die.Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish I had a friend I could tell that I am suffering.

Late 30s and have been unhappy for years. I have struggled with depression since I was 15/16. On and off medication. And have been to therapy many times. I turned to finding someone online to fill the voids of my unhappy marriage. And this is the part I know most of you will disapprove of and I get it. I have talked to quite a few people online over the years. Male. Female. Made some friends. Had my heart broken. Recently, I met a man online. Our connection was instant. And you can say or think what you want, but i genuinely love him. Were a lot a like. I came to learn he also battles depression and anxiety. But we dealSo differently. Hes become my best friend. I would tell him anything and everything but he shuts me out. He does not tell me anything. Its so hard for me. I do not know how to support him. I do not want to turn my back on him because hes currently going through a really rough patch , but he just shuts me out. He says he wants me in his life but I do not know how to be what he needs. Especially when i too have been having really bad days. I feel like we need each other. Like there is a reason we connected, but being shut out makes me feel like crap. I have told no one this but the past couple of weeks while driving , I have literally thought to myself , just pull out in front of that car. Just do it. These are not suicidal thoughts but more .... I am just sick of putting everybody else first and maybe being hurt and laying in bed recovering would help put me first. I could stop putting all my energy on everyone else for even just a little. I know. Its crazy. This man I mentioned does not know this is how I have been feeling. I cannot stand the thought of him thinking it has anything to do with him. Or him worrying about me when hes got enough on his plate. I thought we would understand each other better than most people could I thought wed be able to support each other in our bad times. I cannot lose him. But maybe were both just too broken. New here and just need to vent.",0

"I (25F) struggle with depression/anxiety for years and for the most part of it suicide thoughts too (never acted on them tho).All of this is mostly because I am just lost on what to do with my life, not some major trauma (If you do not count the bullying i experienced younger).I just cannot seem to find anything interesting to do. I never wanted nor want to marry/have kids and I have zero hobbies because nothing catches my attention. Even simple things like music/tv/games keep my attention for a short period of time and then I am bored again.That have been a hell for me because I do not seem to be able to either work, in fact I find work the worst part of being alive.I do not even find people interesting to form friendships/relationships. Had a few friends while at school but did not keep in contact bc I do not want to talk to them, it makes me bored. Had a few people flirt with me but they just seemed way too much for me to handle. I am ashamed to say this but I do not even want to have sex, in fact I cringe like a 5 year old.Even travelling is not something for me, I just do not care about the ""beauty"" of this shithole and seeing other places or whatever.

"Heard my grandparents talk behind my back, ""Why does not she ever go out, even x goes out and does this and that""I only heard bits of their conversation but I also heard the word ""crazy"" in my native languageTo think that I asked for help and my mom and grandma just brushed it off. I have been sick for what feels like a decade now and I am so sick of being sick, I just want to die.I got my diagnosis when my friends snuck me into therapy. The psychiatrist had to stop meeting me because he would lose his license if he did. A year or two later, I confessed to my grandma but she got mad because I told my friends. I do not know what I expected. she is always cared about her reputation the most. Always bragged about me attending a nice school and getting nice grades. does not want a word of me being depressed going out and refuses to address it. My performance in school has started deteriorating, I am not sleeping and eating well. I asked for a break from school but I am not getting it. I am going to get dragged to school tomorrow for my college enrollment. have not settled my clearance and will most likely be waitlisted. A part of me did it intentionally out of spite and also, is there even a point anymore? I do not know if I can hold out for longer. I am at a point where I might kill myself any time. Thinking is exhausting and I really wish that I would just do it already.Whenever I got sick and had to be absent from school for a day or two, my grandma does not even ask me why or if I am alright. she is more concerned about the fact that I am absent from school. I could go on about how terrible of a person she is but you already get it.My family always says how grateful I should be because they fed me and gave me shelter. I fucking hate it so much. Thanks, I was not aware that having children is so similar to having pets. (Although I would do so much more than food and shelter if I had a pet.)Everything hurts. I just woke up from a whole day's sleep and I just want to sleep again in the hopes that I will never wake up. The only thing I do whenever I am awake is cry anyway. My eyes hurt so much at this point.I am 18 already so I could go and meet a psychiatrist without needing my family's consent now. But I am so tired and I cannot function anymore.I hope my unhealthy lifestyle kills me soon. Even suicide sounds so tiring. I am going back to sleep. Asked for help but did not get it.",1

"So I, 18F want to go to Columbia. I fucked up my high school chances. I went to the best school in my state and could not fucking get it together. I could not focus, was always procrastinating, could not find any real joy. Got admitted to a mental hospital, and then transferred my senior year. It was awful. I felt so out of place. The work was not hard to understand, i just could not get in the right headspace to do it. Come to find out, it was ADHD (well, i will not get the official yay or nay until the 2nd).Graduated with a 3.6 weighted, did not study for my ACT got a 27, not many extracurriculars and I want to learn from my mistakes and do better. But I just feel like I have ruined my dreams. I doubt an Ivy League school will want someone who did poorly in high school even if they turned it around in college. I know I am capable of doing the work i just, idk its so fucking hard man. Like i just feel stuck and i feel suicidal again because I feel worthless. All my friends got into their dream schools and I did not. I understand an Ivy Education is not everything but its something i wanted and it just really hurts. I just feel like a huge idiot. I want to do better so i can try again next year but there is this huge underlying feeling of it does not fucking matter anyways, there is a 3% chance you will even be considered, let alone get in. I want to make myself proud. I am going to take the year i have to reflect and get my shit together to prove i can do it, but still I do not feel proud, i feel like i let myself down and there is nothing i can do about it.

And I know its not me. I know its just my brain being a cunt. But I would be lying if I said I did not believe it sometimes.

"I went on vacation this week for a wedding. I was the best man. I did it out of obligation to my best friend of 18 years. I have had active suicidal ideation and rumination over negative thoughts almost daily for over a year, following the end of my own engagement.The day before the wedding, I went into a canyon trail in the Rockies some 2000 miles away from my very flat homeland. I had multiple reasons: clearing my head for the best man speech I had not finished, exercise, and I was passively searching for a good spot to jump if the desire was there.I started at the bottom of the trail as miserable as usual. It was hot and dry. Hot sand was getting in my sandals.When you get about a third through, you run into greenery and you start to hear the promise of a river. Following the trail a bit more takes you to a small stream where you can appreciate the sounds and the drop in heat. The snowmelt will be almost ice cold on a scorching day even this far down.Up the trail, it gets a little redundant again, but just as you start to resent the effort, you see another formation of rock and water or a large ancient tree. As you get to the penultimate portions, you have steep rock paths that you can no longer simply tread without using your hands, but at this point, every sight you are seeing is more beautiful than the one that came before it, so there is only joy in the effort.At last, when you get to the waterfall, the payoff seems better than anything you anticipated. The pool at the base is knee-deep. The water is refreshingly cold and clear. And the sounds are more rewarding than any music you had on your earbuds on the way there.It was like a religious experience. It was fundamentally mood altering. The day or so after was the first time in over a year where I had zero rumination over negative thoughts, not to mention no ideation. And I killed the speech according to about 20 people. I was able to actually enjoy my best friend being happy. I was enjoying the new connections I made, and I really felt like my best days were not behind me.TL;DR: It sounds cliche, but try hiking, especially if you have something requiring the right amount of payoff for your effort. it is like a microcosm of flow (the psychological concept).

"All of my friends are going places, traveling, seeing family, meanwhile I am sitting at home playing some useless bullshit video game and jerking off. God damnit, when did my life take a turn for the worst? Sadly I did not die in my sleep last night. I detest holidays",0
My life has always been a mess but now I am at a point where I do not have much energy left to go on any further. Every second is tormenting me. I have made several mistakes that threw what is been left of me and my life completely off the rails and now I am devastated. I do not have any perspectives whatsoever and self hate eats me. What can I do? Nothing is fun anymore and I have no one. It gets worse everyday. People are trying to help me and they really do see what I am saying but they do not know how to help me either and they are professionals. I am in mental hospitals most of the time but it does not help. I do not know what to do anymore I feel horrible,1
"not sure if this is the best place for this but here me please...i can NOT live in the house i am in any longer My parents are not abusive per say BUT they can say the most soul crushing things in 5 year y'know... the pain really builds up over time i just want to live with someone who respects who i am and what i stand for, simply and truthfully. I was holding the knife last night and i was soo damn close to ending it all. while i do not have a job now I promise ABSOLUTELY PROMISE to get one ""there"" i know this post will get me nowhere but i am 19 and i live in Oakville, Ontario, Canada god bless all you angels and sorry for wasting your time Truly i am... LAST DITCH CALL FOR ..help... forgive me for asking",1
"Maybe a long post, I do not care who reads this. I just have a lot of stuff I want to get off my chest. Or maybe I just want someone to listen, who knows lolAnyway as the title says, I am really convinced I will one day kill myself. Maybe not right now, but I am sure it will definitely happen. I have always had suicidal thoughts, I have even tried to attempt many times. So I know I have it in me to do it, I just do not know when, or what is stopping me. I am only 17 and I feel like I have so much going on. I have been put on an antidepressant early last month, and I have been going to therapy ever since, but I still feel so hopeless and so disgusted with myself. My self hate is sometimes unbearable, to the point I do not eat or ever take care of myself. I have lost so much weight over the past couple months it is scarring my familyI feel like the medicine I am on has helped me be more social around my family and in a better mood, (sorry if this sounds strange) but I kind of feel like I am better able to hide my feelings? Almost like I am wearing a mask around everyone. I still feel the same as I have always been, still hating myself, not eating, yknow the same stuff I have been doingI want to tell my therapist that I have been having suicidal thoughts recently (like a bunch), but I do not want to scare my family (I am a minor so I believe my therapist will tell my parents), or maybe even be sent somewhere. it is also gotten to the point where I have really vivid dreams about death, or killing myself and being happy about it. I have also have been struggling with self harm for the past months too, and I feel like I have been doing it more than usual. I have been doing it on my thigh so it is been easy to hide, but I have gone against my self rule of not doing it on my wrist. Everything is weird, the pain does not really bother me anymore. I will do anything to maybe hate myself less. I want to reach out about these problems to someone, but like I said earlier I am scared. I cannot imagine what will happen when my family finds out I have been self harming. Sometimes I even catch myself making plans to kill myself, thinking about how I would do it, when, the most painless and quickest way to do it. I have came to conclusion that hanging myself may be my best bet, but to do it at night. I know my family would miss me, and I would because great pain, but honestly I do not care what happens. As long as I am not here, as long as I am not me, I do not want to exist anymore. I hate it I hate everythingI swear I feel so horrible about everything, anything I do, sometimes I will have to catch myself because I feel I have embarrassed myself or that I am doing to much. I have not even really been doing my favorite things anymore, I have not even been listening to music which I used to everyday. I just sit and do nothing, I cannot bring myself to find the motivation to do anythingI also start school soon, like next month and this will be my second year at this new school. And also my final year of highschool. Honestly my junior year was horrible, my grades were falling, and I literally had no friends, when I tell you I would literally not open my mouth to talk to anyone I mean it. I feel weird about talking to people, I feel I am not worth anyone's time so why bother? I feel I really gave up that year, I did not try with outfits, I just wore a hoodie and jeans every single day. I cannot imagine how I will feel when I start again, I do not know if I can handle it again. But I guess yay it is my last year lolI also have some online friends, and I have been kind of distancing myself from them. Part of it is that I do not really feel like talking to anyone, and another part of it is because I feel super left out. Sometimes I catch myself getting upset or angry, even though I am not there? Maybe I am mad because I do not really get attention, I just wish people would care about me yknow? Sometimes I catch myself going out my way to get someone is attention, or like do something I know that my friends like? Idk what to call it, sometimes I feel so left out, but it is also my fault I guess I feel left out? Idk man, I have not even been talking to anyone at all, I just wish someone would reach out to me and ask how I am doing. But if I reach out to someone I feel like a huge bother, and my thoughts go racingIdk things right now are strange, I am about to enter adult life and I am scared as fuck, I cannot imagine being by myself or doing adult things. I cannot even imagine myself being successful at that, I feel like I am going to get no where if I am being honest with you I am convinced the way I will die will be me ending my life",0
"I am getting a wave of depression yet again and it is keeping me up tonight so I just wanted to talk. Whenever this happens it usually involves self-doubt and loathing, it is so frustrating. I recently graduated from college and this whole transition to adulthood thing is making it exponentially worse. When I talk to my friends about it I just feel like I am constantly burdening them even though they are very supportive. I really love and appreciate them and they are one of the few reasons I am not spiraling out of control. As if depression was not enough, I also suffer from social anxiety (though it has gotten much better than was a few years ago). As you can imagine, that just destroys any bit of personality I have. I provide pretty much little to nothing in conversation between friends and I find it hard to make friends at work or anywhere really since I am so bland and boring. Another problem I have is that my self-hatred really destroys my self-confidence and affects the way I portray myself to other people. It makes me seem less approachable or just not worth approaching. With the frequent waves of depression I have been experiencing lately, I am afraid I am going to start drifting apart from my friends and end up alone. it is just so hard to live feeling like this with these thoughts. I feel like there is a constant pressure on my chest. Now onto some positives about me that I should remind myself about. I am witty and funny once in a while. I get myself up and working when I have to even if I do not want to. I am doing a good job of stepping out of my comfort zone and tackling my social anxiety by working in customer service. I have been putting effort into a hobby I am passionate about and working towards improvement. This is starting to sound like a diary, but I guess that is what my whole account essentially is. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and I hope you encounter something that will make you smile today/tonight :) Feel free to reply or comment anything. Just spilling my feelings",0

I have all the insight in the world as to what is going on with my brain, what thoughts I should ignore, blah blah blah (I do not say that to minimize their importance), but it really is to the point that I do not care if I die in my sleep. It feels like there is something inherently wrong with my entire profile as a person and I am only 32 and feel like I have lived for 80 years. I think my reserves are tapped and even when I see a light at the end of the tunnel, it gets eclipsed. I cannot even be scared for myself anymore. I do not even want to ask for help anymore. I would not wish this on anyone. Been asking for help...and I am losing [if not lost] hope",0

"Think about it, assisted suicide is practiced in some areas for physical pain. And as I learn more about mental health, it is a fact that emotional pain can be felt at the same degree as physical pain. So does not it just make sense to give us mentally disturbed folks that relief too?And what are we to say to the people who have kept pushing and pushing through the pain for years, some their whole life. What do we say to them? ""It gets better"" is a laughable response at that point. ""I am sorry"" does not solve anything. For many of us, suicide is not an emotional response, it is a logical one. In my opinion, there is a point where suicide just makes sense",1
"I am going into a new school for 12th grade this fall and I am terrified. Because I get bullied wherever I go. Private school, public school, international school, wherever I transfer to, it does not matter, I am always isolated labelled the loser of the school. Bc of covid i was given a break from school for a year, and after experiencing that graceful one year, I do not think I could go back to enduring the high stress and anxiety I get from having to see the faces of people who treat me like trash. I do not want to. I desperately do not want to. And the thing that scares me even more is that I do not think the bullying and ostracizing will stop even after I finish high school, because clearly the problem lies within me. But I cannot fix myself. Right now my future looks like a life of getting stepped on and used wherever I go, and that is so dreadful, I would rather just not live. But I do not even have the to courage to kill myself... how sad. I am so sick of living like this. I am sick of having no way out. I am sick of the people around me who do not give a shit about my feelings. But most of all...I am just tired of being alone. Its ridiculous, that I do not even make the effort into making other people feel better, but I expect to be cared for and loved in return for nothing. I say that I am sick of people not caring about my feelings... but I also do not care about theirs. it is crazy. it is crazy how selfish I am... I do not want to deal with myself anymore.

"First time going this far. Drove about a kilometer of a dark road keeping my eyes shut for the most time. Opened them when I finally felt something besides of intoxicating feeling of myself.I have been an outsider my whole life. And every piece of the feeling of being a part of something was pretty precious to me. Recently I have got my engineering diploma. I should be more or less happy, it was a long work after all, but I have lost another collective.Sadly, I had been diagnosed with depression before and have been fighting with it for a while, but now...I even start *considering* to make a final surrender. To get in the sweet cold hug of the unexistence. To dissolve into nothing. To stop experiencing things.I feel like this is linked to the loneliness I have been living with for a while. Quite for a while, I may say. Last year's covid waves have left me alone in the dark bunker of my home with just enough support to allow food and the internet. This solitude has even changed me a bit - I have stopped drinking, started intermittent fasting and so on. Now I consider returning to alcohol. It just gives some veil of indifference from a hum in my head. The hum of negativity and overthinking I burden myself with.I remember myself *before*. Many do, I guess. I remember my life with narcissistic parents, those goddamned nights full of studies, early attendance to the medical university and all lost time and social skills. Damn, I even understand now why I was always in outsider.But then I have left the university, stopped talking to the most of m family, reunited with it is functional part, got first job, was hopeful to attend engineering university, tried to invent stuff, learn skills, start something. Now the fire has gone out. A small amber of hope still glows though, and that is the reason why I only *consider* a final surrender.Another bad thing, I guess, is that I have come to a certain conclusions about our universe. They basically state that after death we do not experience anything. No time, no darkness, nothing. And after some time we will exist again in the future, because it is our only option to *exist*. As an addition to those conclusions I have got the idea that the life cycle will repeat in one way or another. Until something changes enough in one of the lifes, so we would be redeemed from our regular life cycles. The final surrender does not make it better though, as in my mind it may make things worse, but who cares on the end of the line? I have just been driving with my eyes closed.",0

I try to talk to my loved ones. Nobody fucking cares. They cannot help me. They try but cannot help me. I am done with life. Its not working out. I am sorry for being such a failure. I hate my life.",0

I moved into my parents house from uni a few days ago. I do not have money otherwise I would have stayed at uni. Its only been 5 days and I do not think I can go on anymore. I knew it would be hard but its worse than I expected. I cannot stop crying at night and I burst into tears randomly during the day. I start my summer job tomorrow and I am also nervous about that because I cannot sleep. I have to stay here till the beginning of September. I feel suicidal and I am scared I might actually kill myself. Its not that I want to die. I just want this situation to go away so bad and death seems like the only other option rn. I told my mum yesterday I do not want to be here in tears and she started calling me ungrateful. she is very religious so she thinks any suicidal thoughts are from the devil. So I left the house and walked around just crying until my mum called and told me to come back. My sister does not like me and she keeps asking why I was born. I think I need antidepressants. My GP gave me CBT videos to look at but they have not helped at all. I know this post is all over the place I really do not know what to do. I just need some reassurance everything will be ok. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I cannot stop crying,0

"You once dreamed of being a writer. You once dreamed of being an artist, a drawer. You once dreamed as a child, that your rebellious and individualistic ideology would have a place in this society. Professors and teachers recognized your ability to see the world in a way other people could not see and question things that no one else questioned. You won advanced placement awards. Your AP teachers ADMIRED the way you think based on the way you wrote. You won artist awards two years in a row. This is an art that you never were taught to invest in.Your single mother never had enough time to put any effort into caring about your talents. You never had any recognition besides those that awarded you. No one invested in you. She did not care enough. She does not care enough to to invest in your talent, she BARELY cares enough to invest in the bare necessities. Are children who grew up in single parent households more likely to be antinatalist? I am. I know from other family members that she would have wanted to abort me. I wish she did. do not have a kid when you are not ready. The Child will KNOW when you resent them. Trust me.The childs perspective I am a living sentient being but because I am not wanted I fell like an obligation. Save parenthood until you only want it for sure. I am HERE, I am STUCK HERE, I wish I was aborted so I do not have to because so much grief in my family when I do die. I do not want to be here. I do not want to be here. You barely half assed wanting me to be here. Motherhood is not meant for everyone. Stop trying to trick people into wanting parenthood.PEOPLE FIND OUT That THEY REGERT PARENTHOOD WHEN ITS TOO LATE. If you have second thoughts then please do not have kids. Kids deserve someone who is one hundred percent sure about them . This is what I am discovering about relationships. I do not want to be second guessed. I do not want to feel like an obligation. Ill isolate until I feel like I am valued or wanted. I do not see a point in living. You had a kid just to keep her alive. You kept me alive. there is more to life than that and I do not know what it is. Fuck you.If any of you have kids that you 1. Leave behind and forget about or 2. leave with a single parent then FUCK YOU YOU SELFISH PEICE OF SHITWe live lives. Were people. And you have invested nothing.

I broke my friends' families. I broke my own life. I break everyone around me. Everything is a problem when I am involved. Do I ever make things better? I do not even know why I exist. I technically was not supposed to be born. Do I exist to make life worse? Do I exist to just be a punching bag for whoever wants to hurt someone? Am I just a scapegoat for every bad thing? Every day is just a new problem in my life. I am sick of pretending I am getting better, when I am not. No amount of exercise or meditation or whatever will fix me. I am a mistake that should be punished. I have done many unspeakable things in my very short life. I get what I deserve I guess. I really hope people will not pity me for my sob story. I am so truly evil, the sight of myself disgusts me. I know that people will miss me when I am gone at first. I know how much it will hurt. But really, why spend time crying about me when I am 6 foot under? People will get over it. I do not see anyone crying now because my granddad died, because he died 12 years ago. I assume in 12 years time, people will forget. When I am gone, please look after my mum and grandma. Tell them it was not their fault. Knowing them, they will blame themselves. Tell them that I am ok now, and I am not in pain any more. Tell them I love them. I have hurt so many people in the past, and for that I am truly sorry. Every single person, from strangers to my worst enemies. I feel as though I need to make amends before I die. And to everyone who did not know me until now. I am sorry you had to meet me that way.

I want to help them but I feel like I cannot because I am suicidal too and I am still dealing with that. I feel guilty because I do not know what to do. But I feel like I am about to have an anxiety attack about it. How do I stop myself from wanting to die to help someone else? I do not know what to say because all the generic things people say to suicidal people do not work on me. I love them so much and the mean the world to me but I cannot express my feelings about anything. How am I supposed to help my other suicidal people when I cannot help myself?",1
"This is my story.My first memory is from 4 years old, when I woke up in an apartment, my mom had went outside and I panicked. I went outside the building in nightgown crying helplessly.Other memory is about finding out what death means when I was 6 years old. I realized that a grandfather I never met was gone forever and that all people face that one day. I rolled myself in a mat having a panic attack and I was laughed at.Then school started. I was taken sexually advantaged by my school mates.I tried to kill myself at 12.I was raped at 12 and again at 13.I was taken sexually and emotionally advantaged by an adult from 14-17 years of age.Now I am 29. My 10 year lasting relationship is at it is end due to my emotional problems. I would be graduating and starting a dream job in fall. But I just cannot anymore. I have zero people to talk to, no friends. Therapy can start in the end of september the earliest due to lack of resources. I cannot afford paying therapy and get there faster.I think I would be better to just stop being a burden to everyone around me. My mom told me I was not wanted. Everyone is better without me and I cannot offer what my partner deserves. I do not want to be me",1
"Every time something bad happens to me, why is it always my fault. Why does everyone including my family tell me to get over it and leave it in the past. Why do they shun me whenever I try to talk about it. Why am I the idiot, even when I try and help my best friend I get called an idiot in silence. I am sick and tired of it all, of everyone. I really wish I could take my life I wish I had the balls to take that step, but am angry, but I am so fuckin sad that the angry is fading away. I know it will pass, but it just feels like an eternity. Why am I always the one in the wrong. I feel like its pointless to try and make things work when I am the idiot",0
I finally want to admit that my depression rules over every aspect of my life. I feel like a zombie almost every hour of my life. I am a disabled veteran that does not feel like the V.A. provides quality or consistent mental health care. Any advice on free or reduced mental health care in Hampton Roads Virginia? I am a Depressed Veteran,0
"We cannot even act surprised either. He told all of us how depressed he was. The last time I saw him he said his mind was going to dark places. The way he said it though was so ambiguous. he would always smile and laugh after. Id give a generic response like oh do not say that, or some bullshit. When I found out today though, it hurt in my heart because I have been thinking about it too. I did not tell my friend. I have said the words before to people I considered friends but no one ever knows what to say or says the right thing. What do you do anymore? So much pain and sadness this year. I just found out my friend committed suicide.",1
"something i like to do when i feel like giving up is think about my future and how in a few months i will not be upset and down about the things that are making me feel like this right now, and think about how in a few years you will most likely be happy &lt;3 i hope everyone has a better year than the previous one and things get better but it might take a while.. it is better to wait then to give up :P a tip to use when you feel like giving up&lt;3",1
"Just another vent because I have got no one else to share these with:Wonder how people are handling relationships or just how they get handed the best partners that they are meant to be with.I am tired of the fights that keep coming from nowhere, I get blamed for the fights started by the SO. Tears and struggles in every aspect of life, why does it have to be me????Why cannot I be happy or get to enjoy the ordinary things in life. Tired of life and I cannot even be open about it, masking it and acting like everything's going great.I honestly envy those who have it all, relationship, personality, etc etc etc the same things that I have been deprived of.And I cannot even focus on things anymore, I feel like I am losing the ability to concentrate. I find it difficult to argue/defend, let alone explain myself or even understand situations because I am unable to have that clarity. I have to keep thinking what just happened, what should I say, who started this fight...Feeling exhausted and fed up... Had enough of it all...",0
"It was so hard to get out of bed this morning to go to work. I have heard the soft comfort of bed referred to as ""death"" once and I understand it. I did not want to get up. I just wanted to lay there forever, even if that meant losing my job, my income, my ability to take care of myself.it is a long 12 hour shift. I physically do not feel I can make it. Mentally I have been checked out for a while.I have thought about getting a different job but I feel it would be more of the same.I wish I could just give in. I just want to sleep and dream my life away. I am really struggling today",0
"I have been dealing with depression, anxiety, ptsd and multiple other disorders for several years. some years were better than others, while some i barely made it through. I have gone on multiple medications and countless therapists, outpatients, changing environments constantly. another shitty year for me, I have been loosing myself left and right. the last few weeks have been the worst and i cannot even put my finger on what is been causing it. every single night its another struggle in my head and living alone and rarely leaving my place or even talking to family or friends, I am isolated. its not like i have the energy or will power to explain to a bunch of people what i can barely grasp my head around. all they would ever say is that its been almost ten years now and that i need to get over it, go outside more. I have tried everything, i mean everything. every night is another battle. I am proud of myself for even making it this far. yet i still cannot stop hating myself for all I have caused people. forget other people, what I have caused for myself. and like every other night for the past few years. ill sit and contemplate every single thing I have done and tire myself out with the thinking to finally get a break from myself and sleep only to wake up and repeat another rough night",0
"1) My brother got drunk, broke my foot and told me he does not believe me about my sexual abuse and also told me to get it over with and kill myself (when I am letting him live rent and bill free)2) My dad told me to fuck off because he walked in to the house I pay for and immediately started attacking me verbally and was incredibly angry very quickly3) My Nana told me today, knowing I am bulimic and have massive self image issues, that I have put on weightWhy did I move away from my friends for this So I moved to be closer to family",0
"I am, useless.I am, selfish.I am embarrassed because I cannot control my emotions and it annoys the people around me. I just want to be a normal functioning person, I want meds for my depression and I want people to believe me when I say I am not feeling okay.I am tired of not being taken seriously, and sometimes I want to attempt suicide so people understand that their words hurt, I just want the pain to stop.I want to be loved without the other person wanting me to be flawless, I want to exist and co-exist without worrying about if what I say is offensive or stupid or annoying.I want to die so the pain stops, I want it gone. I want the nagging thoughts about my body to stop, I want to be a normal boy, I want to be skin and bones, I want to be so thin that my hands fit around my ankles and my ribs jut out, i want to be happy with myself.I want you to love me without me sending pictures or being upbeat, or cute or bratty. I want you to understand that its not me when I throw tantrums as you call them. I do not want to be annoying anymore, I do not want sex, I do not want to be taken advantage of. I just want to be loved. Ignore this, I just want to get it all out.",1
"Hey , is there any depressed people up to create a group chat to talk about our lives and talk together ? Chat together",0
"Giving me mood stabilizers will not make me feel better like all these years never happenedI cannot wait any longer, this is the longest day ever and it is not even close to endingI know they will not give me anything for weeks to say the least and I have been waiting and putting everything away for too much timeThey're just letting me suffer on purpose, how can they think somebody who is told you about dropping themself off a roof and that has obviously tried to kill themself in the past can stand living without any kind of help except some fucking lithium that was not even your idea but somebody else's who actually for once cared enough about my mental health and did somethingI've been feeling like this for way too long and i do not even find killing myself as an option anymore, i just need someone, i cannot have all this shit thrown at me and act like it is nothing I need a solution right now",0
"Long post incoming. Sorry, it is kind of a cry for help.When I was a kid, I was reading books like a madman. I distinctly remember the time the 6th volume of Harry Potter came out, and I stayed up all night, managing to read the entire thing in one sitting. I am 24 years old now and would absolutely not be able to accomplish such a feat. Years of sitting in front of screens and allowing that dopamine flow have wrecked my attention span. I get easily distracted by the smallest things while reading a book, constantly having to re-read paragraphs, ultimately getting frustrated and putting the book away for ""later"" - and a book that should not take longer than a week, takes me at least a few MONTHS to read.I struggle with studying, too. The entirety of school was easy for me and I did not have to study that much, so naturally I filled that time with video games and the internet instead. Since I was a shy, introverted guy filled with social anxiety who did not really have friends, I had tons of time to waste in front of the computer or the phone. By the time university came, I was in no way prepared and disciplined enough for it, I did not have a work or study ethic. I ended up wasting my time, dropping out of 3 different majors (Chinese studies, law and computer science) because they ended up not feeling right for me, and me lacking the attention span and perseverance to try my best. I still do not have a degree despite being 24. I am starting Sound Design this October, since I have determined that I am interested in music and sound and would like to pursue that as a career, but I fear my lack of focus will because me to fail that as well.Nowadays I am working in an office, where I naturally have to be in front of a computer for 8 hours, then I go back to a lonely home where I am going to sit in front of another computer or my phone until it is time to sleep - day, after day, after day. it is a job which barely pays enough for me to sustain myself, saving up for traveling, which is what I dream of doing, is off the table. I am lonely. I do not have a girlfriend, I do not exercise, I am overweight (not obese though), I barely spend time on any other hobbies. I could be amazing at playing piano and learning Japanese, which are two things that I am interested in, if only I was willing to spend as much time on them as I am spending on video games and watching stupid bullshit on the internet. But my stupid brain refuses to actually focus and I cannot get my shit together. I have tried making a change reducing my screen time a few times, but it always falls apart after a few days tops.I need help. I do not want to be a depressed, lonely underachiever filled with regret for the rest of my days. I am a depressed, lonely, underachieving internet/video game addict with no perspectives. Rant/cry for help",0
Does anyone know of any supplements that have helped them w their mental health? I know many of us have ~sexual troubles~ on antidepressants taking high dose ashwagandha for a week completely changed that for me.

"I do not think anyone or anything can stop me. I no longer have any reason to live. Even my future is certain. I am really depressed, my grades are declining, and not a single person enjoys being around me or having anything to do with me. I am currently planning what the most painless way will be. Any suggestions? And do not try to say do not kill yourself, there is help out there. I have seeker help and it did not work at all. I am miserable and just want to end this shit. What would the least painful way be? I have decided to kill myself",1

"I do not want help. I do not want to bother anyone. I just want to let the words out before I burst. Implode from the inside I am under the water. And I am struggling. I cannot feel my feet or arms. I have been fighting to swim for so long, I am just weak and exhausted. I am losing the fight. I feel drunk. Like my words are not coming out right. My body is numb. I cannot see straight through the flashbacks of everything. Every event. Every time I have been abandoned or betrayed. Every beating. From childhood to now. And I just. cannot. I have never fallen so deep in the black hole like this that I felt drunk before I gave in to drinking myself senseless, begging to feel anything else. I am not winning the battle. But I am terrified this is THE battle that ends the war. How do I keep going when everything in me has stopped fighting? When that voice in the back of my head that always pulls me through is even tired? I wanted a new life. Thought maybe if I started my new life it would get better. But nothing feels better in this moment. In this moment I feel like a failure. I just want the pain to stop. For the memories to quit screaming in my head on a repeat. On a constant loop. I am so tired of trying to swim against the current. I want so badly to just give in and let it wash me away. I just want it to stop. I am drowning",1
"Todays society truly sucks. Covid has infiltrated most of our current society, as well as climate change. We are ruining this planet and smashing it to pieces. Societally we are on the decline. People are getting less jobs, having less friends, less relationships, etc.I am sick of it and it makes me want to go back in time to another era Todays society sucks",0
"This is a lot, and a long story, the past 3 months have been so hard and I do not know how to deal. This is a vent but also just trying to have someone understand what I have been through I guess. I have dealt with depression (along with OCD and GAD) my entire life, I have self-helped for a decade and started dealing with it more seriously 3 years ago going to therapy. Life has taken a big turn in the past year and I am having trouble processing. Obviously Covid has been a big thing, lost my favourite job bartending at a music venue which was something I was super passionate about and loved. I made a big move to try and start fresh. I was having health issues and while not pinpointing what was wrong with me I was told I may be infertile, which was a lot. Bought an AMC and started working on it as a project while I was not working and that brought me joy. Then while dealing with my health, found out I was pregnant. Bam. was not sure what to do, and I just could not go through with a procedure, and although hopeful made sure I made the decision knowing I might be alone in doing it. My sister was extremely supportive. I found a good job, got promoted and found a new roommate who was super excited about living with a baby as my roommate at the time was not sure and that was totally fair. I did everything I could to secure our future. My roommates parents bought a place for rental income and investment, I painted 2 rooms 8 months pregnant because it was not freshly painted or new. Made the place my own, set it up beautifully before baby was here. Spent my savings on new furniture and everything the baby could need. Everything was looking pretty bright, and then I started labour. It went on for 84 hours of active labour, I had absolutely terrible care in the hospital, my epidural failed, the first doctor dealing with me did not tell me anything or helped, and on the 83.5 hour a female obstetrician knew I would needed a C-section LONG ago. It was so traumatic, and I am so happy he made it here healthy and happy. I hated being in the hospital and I left as soon as they let me, I was sleep deprived and not sane to leave, let alone physically capable after that surgery. When I got home I had no help, I could not move, and I felt so helpless. My new roommate left the place a mess while I was in the hospital and I was not okay. Found out my mom relapsed for the first time in many many years after she did not come help me and left me alone in my bed crying for 8 hours, and acting very strange. My roommate ended up being a piece of shit, and told me to leave 2 weeks after my surgery where I could not walk because I was pushing myself cleaning up after her, and doing everything myself because she needed a break. I had to travel and push myself even further. My sister who was previously so supportive abandoned me. I was totally alone. When I came back home, my roommate put all this dangerous ant killer dust everywhere on every window sill, wall, ledge, and was spraying Raid in the air like air freshener because of a few ants, that I never even saw. She would not clean it up even though it is dangerous to breathe in for an adult let alone a newborn. She then proceeded to spray Raid outside my room at 3am, knocking on my door to show me one ant at 3am to try and prove she was in the right. I had to give my month notice as she would not clean it up. I could not live like that. I left again, it was not safe for me to be there, my breathing and coughing was insane. I had pushed myself so hard that I started bleeding terribly, got an insane fever and had to go to the hospital alone. It was a week after my 1 month notice and I was just going to clean up the ant dust myself so I could pack my things etc. But when I got home every single item I owned was put on my bed, on the floor of my room and it was completely uninhabitable. My dishes, every single last item in storage, in the living room, groceries, laundry room etc. I had a full blown meltdown and just asked her how she could do this to a new mom, a single mother at that, she begged me for forgiveness, said she was so sorry about everything she put me through and since I could not live there that she would give my rent back. I packed everything and put it into storage, moving truck, and supplies it all cost me so much. She played nice and asked me what she could do etc. As soon as I was gone she and her parents (landlords) blocked me and denied my promised rent back. Legally because I had given my notice, I cannot do anything. So I have been couch surfing with a newborn for 2 months. My dad's gf has ALS and he suggested we find a place together so I could save some money, now I am caretaking a newborn and her. With all this stress and instability my anxiety is through the roof, my OCD back tenfold, and I feel like an absolute failure for my son. All his clothes in storage outgrew, all the new things I bought with my savings a waste. Just living out of bags. Then I had an extremely painful gallbladder attack as a cherry on top. Because storage is in another city I still do not have my things and will not even be able to fit it in the new tiny place, just a small room for me and my son. it is just too fucking much. I feel so ostracized and alone because of Covid, just being a parent and not able to do anything, I have been sober because I am breastfeeding so cannot even cope unhealthily for even a night. I cannot afford therapy, I do not have any real help. My doctor think my depression and anxiety are fine because my baby is healthy so it cannot be that bad. I do not know where to start. I love him so fucking much, and he is my world but I feel like I have not even been able to just enjoy being a mother and I feel so fucking robbed of the experience I know it should have and could have been. If I did not have him, I know I would not be here today. I am tired of being strong, I do not feel strong. I cannot stop crying, I am exhausted, I am hurt. Thank you if you read this all, and I do not know what I am expecting but I am not doing okay. I have always dealt with depression fairly well but life keeps throwing so much more and I do not know how to handle it",0
"I cannot afford a therapist. I have social anxiety, depression and ADHD and I am always haunted by trauma induced negative thoughts since middle school, I tried everything...self help , talking to others (never do it, they do not give a fuck you and you will find yourself abandoned). What is there to live for ? never got anyone in my life, always lost and all we ever do here is cyclejerk each other into surviving further in misery only to have this FUCKING cycle repeating itself. there is NO WAY OUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY BECAUSE I TRIED AND I FEEL SICK OF THIS SHIT ! it is just too much , too many financial problems to cover as a student , and my mental health is in shambles ,cannot afford therapist or shit , suicidal thoughts all the time",1
"I have been playing tennis for over 10 years and around 8 is the time i spent trying my hardest to become a pro in league of legends as well. It destroyed my right wrist and i need to get a surgery.

Does a guys mental health even netter?Like for a certain kind of guy who is always giving his time away and helping everyone but himself. A guy who works his ass off to receive so fucking little in return. A guy that the only time he gets to himself is in the bathroom.

"Many days I can only get out of bed long enough to grab food or water. When I see people who wake up early, workout, do chores, work 9-5, socialize after, run errands...all in one day...I wonder...how? it is too hard. I do not know how to do it. How do people have energy to do stuff?",1
"I have only ever tried to off myself once and that was 6 months ago. Now I am feeling worse than I did back then. I want to die. I hate myself and I just hate living. I have to constantly be worrying if I am going to have a sudden mood swing and do something stupid that I will not be alive to regret later. I do not care about how selfish it is, they all find it as some sort of fucking joke even after having to rush me to the hospital themselves. Whenever I think about pills I want to throw up, but lately, that has not been happening. The moment I am comfortable enough to take pills without immediately throwing up I am going to do it. I do not even care if I do not die. I honestly liked the feeling of being high off pills, and if I die? that is just the extra benefit. I do not see why I need to try stopping myself. what is there to live for? I hate people, I am an asshole so I do not care what they think of it. My life is fine, but I hate being alive and having to go through this. Even If I was not depressed I still do not see the reason why I would want to live. When I tried to off myself my parents both thought it was because I have a low self-esteem (I am not even overweight why would I kill myself just bc I do not like how I look??) but neither of them even took into consideration that it might be their faults. My dad used to beat the shit out of me before he got cancer 2 years ago, and my mom would just get drunk and leave me and my brothers standing outside for 2 hours waiting for her to pick us up just to find out she was not coming. Everyone on my mom's side of the family is an alcoholic, so I am pretty much fucking destined to become one too. There are so many things I have to worry about in the future so why do I need to fucking wait longer? 90% of the people I talk to just tell me to see a therapist. What the fuck is talking going to do to solve my problems?? I am sleep-deprived, I am eating like 700 calories a day, I do not remember the last time I actually took care of myself. I should just down some energy drinks and go for a run, give myself a damn heart attack. I should stay awake for as many days straight as possible and give myself really bad dark circles, then my parents cannot say they did not know I was not doing good. But no, I will probably just start ignoring my depression again after it calms down enough, and eventually I will break and end up dead. What a fun life I am living. what is the point",0
what is the least messiest way to do this without making it harder on people who may discover you have to clean up ect Least messiest way,1
Someone stole some very important documents that would allow them to steal my identity.. a whole new level of stress I did not need. On top of health problems and other stressors. I feel like life just kicks you when you are down. Why bother trying/ at this point maybe Ill just be homeless and die a slow death from being an addict. I do not want to see or feel how awful this world is anymore. Life always gets worse,0
"I do not want to die. But I really do not want to live. But the issues I have been dealing with do not even seem significant enough to hate my life and myself this much. I am so terrified of dying that I do not think I should even consider myself suicidal. But I am in so much emotional pain that I do not understand why I do not just get it over with. Why I do not just fucking hang myself. I had a gun up until a few days ago, but I watched a video of a suicide (in hope it would desensitize me) and it left me scarred at the idea of shooting myself. I had someone get it from me. Someone who I would never have to see or speak to again because i now associate HIM with death. But here I am, wailing. I have been going through so much bullshit but I am suicidal over something so stupid. At least it is stupid to others i mean. I disassociate hard. The person I see in the mirror or in pictures is not who i feel I am. I feel so ugly and unattractive though everyone tells me otherwise. I have had people get mad at me for being insecure when in their eyes, I have no reason to be. I am being ungrateful for my looks. That others are actually ""ugly"" and thus, I am being an asshole for hating myself the way i do. I feel so unwanted. So disgusting. An untouchable. I massively aware of my appearance when around others. I control my smile, the amount of squint of my eyes, how i angle my face, how I furrow my brows. there is not a second I relax from it. Yesterday, a friend and I did a photoshoot. Out of 60 pictures taken of me, only 3 looked DECENT. I was look down in one of them too. They are not any I would brag about or feel confident about. Just 3 that I did not want to delete forever... I looked so hideous. So awkward. So gross. I spent so much effort trying to make sure I looked good and every bit of insecurity was still showing. So all this time I spent trying to look good when around others, they still see what I do not want them to see. No wonder people do not take off guard pictures of me. Basically all my worry and hatred towards myself is true. I do not want to feel right now. I do not want think right now. AND THE WORST PART?! I cannot TALK TO ANYONE WHO would not GET FRUSTRATED WITH ME FOR BEING UNGRATEFUL. Imposter syndrome so strong, I do not even think I am worthy of being suicidal..",1

"I just exist because I have nothing else to do. My job is boring, my life is boring, I think my only friend does not even like me anymore, I only get texts when my fwb wants to fuck and I do not even like sex anymore. Even when I am playing online video games I am asking myself wtf is happening in my life. I have been trying to make new friends, to go outside and talk with people, but maybe I am the problem. I am a boring person with a boring life, boring stories and I get ghosted after a couple of messages. Man, I do not even GAFOS about life anymore. I feel... numb. My family tells me I look like a street dog when someone tries to be friendly (you know, always scared to be beaten and expecting to be hurt again). But that is my life now, this is who I am right now. I have been ignored, ghosted and treated like shit lately and I became so plain nobody likes me anymore. Remember that feeling when you had a crush, a dream or expecting something from life itself? I miss that feeling. I wake up at 6 am every single day with zero calls, zero messages, not a single person asks me if I am still alive.And do not come and say ""get out of your comfort zone"" or ""do not expect something from others"". because you are as broken as I am. IDGAFOS anymore. I am an NPC in someone else's life. I do not even feel like ending my life anymore. I do not feel anything, just a void.",0
It seems like all I do is work to survive and I cannot even seem to do that right. I cannot see a psych because my $480 a month medical insurance will not cover it and my insurance is so bad I have accumulated $2k in medical bills this month alone just trying to get a dental cleaning and get my allergies in check. The car that I thought was a fewest decision just broke and Weill now cost me 1300 to fix. I feel like all I am doing is burying myself in debt by making responsible decisions. I am so fucking drained. I do not date because no one appeals to me. I do not go out anymore because I have other expenses. I do not see my family because I am working. And I am working just to keep myself alive and what a fucking life it is. I have had sleep for dinner twice this week because I have no appetite and I am just so tired of being this goddamn stressed all the time. I am currently at the point where I am not sure why go on day to day.,0

"Basically what is on the title.it is kind of clear we are headed towards who knows what level of crises ahead, and as usual, the Third World will probably be hit the most.Collapse, radical government change, austere governments limiting if not outright outlawing anything that made life remotely enjoyable for the sake of dealing with these crises or attempting to deal with the damage.

"I am someone who has always been highly anxious and neurotic and at times very depressed. I consume tons of self help content but none of it really sticks.What does stick, however, is negativity. If I experience something even remotely negative, Ill read about people dealing with a much worse situation on Reddit and then worry myself sick I will end up where they are. Despite all of the good in my life I envision things going wrong. I have been negative and unpleasant around my girlfriend and am going to end up driving her away. As a grown ass man I will call my mom and complain about every single thing I am dealing with. I feel like somewhere I bought into this whole vulnerability thing too much. I overshare, tell everyone how terrible I think I am or how terrible I feel. I then wonder why no one respects me but then again why would they? If I am feeling bored or depressed Ill spend hours reading about terrible things in the news. Ill watch videos of plane crashes and other terrible things to distract myself from my inner turmoil. I know all of this negativity is bringing me down and keeping me from being successful. I had a friend essentially call me a drama Queen one time. I have no idea how I got here. Probably some crap from childhood or something, although I feel like my childhood was decent.I almost feel guilty being positive. If I tell someone my life is good or talk about good things I have experienced I feel guilty because my entire body starts trying to tell me its a lie. Its like I am not allowed to experience good things or talk about them. I wish I had not read all this crap about vulnerability and how men need to express their emotions. I heard this a long time ago and took this as a license to bitch and moan. Ironically, that is what I am doing right now. I do not want to hold things in and hide myself, but I do not think dumping all my problems on others is helping. I know the internet is not helping. Having said that... please help TL;DR cannot stop holding onto negativity I am addicted to negativity",0
"I do not even know why I am writing this but i need to get this off my chest. I am 21, about to graduate college with very good grades, already have a decent job where everyone seems vey nice and helpful. I have very loving family, i have friends who i talk to almost every day but still even after everything i have i feel empty. I just do not want to exist anymore.it is not that I am sad but that I just can not imagine myself living. I have not tried anything yet but i do not trust myself. I try to keep myself as distracted as possible to stop thinking about it but the moment I am unoccupied I just start thinking about it. I even imagine what the people around me will be like after i die. I do not know when it started exactly but I have been feeling like this for years. In my first year of college i found myself staring down the stairwell ready to just let gravity do the work, then I had a accident in my 2nd year and the only thing i remember feeling during that was relief. I try to live by bargaining for time with my thoughts. I say to myself let us just try living for a week to watch the new episode of a show or let us just wait for that movie to release, or let us just wait until I have visited that place but it is not working anymore. I try thinking that my mom will be sad, my little brother would miss me or my dad will be hurt, but then i think they will get over it after a few years. I have to die someday let us just get it over with. I do not even know why I am like this. I have not told this to anyone. I tried talking to my mom last week but could not. I do not know what to do. I do not know how long i can stop myself. I do not even know why i want to do this. I have not felt happy in la long while, every time i feel happy the emptiness just comes back after a while. Every night i go to sleep dreading waking up in morning. Even now its almost 3 in the morning and i do not want to sleep even though I am tired. I do not know how much longer i can hold out like this. I do not know why I am writing this, i just want to stop. I want to be happy for once, without the permanent anxiety and fear. I want to wake up feeling happy, i do not want to be empty. I want to love someone, anyone. I want to be happy but i feel like i will never be. Please i do not know wat to do i just want to cry but I cannot even do that now. I want to do something i like but i do not like anything. I do not know what i want anymore. Why do i even exist.",1
"Things have gotten so bad that now my body is trying to make me laugh instead of cry to relieve stress. My heart was killing me. Things keep getting worse.

"hope i die , goodbye world just took 63 sleeping pills",1
i really do not know how to explain the reason why i want to die (this time) it just feels like a lot of little things went wrong and then i had a fight with my best friend of six years and she probably hates my guts now (i do not blame her if she does) and it just tipped me over the edge and I have been sobbing on my bed for an hour now. i relapsed and there is blood all over my goddamn sheets and I am crying over that too because i live on a college campus and i do not have enough money to even do my laundry and i do not know how I am going to get these stains out and i want to call my boyfriend (he cannot even help me i just like hearing him tell me I will be okay) but he will not be home from work until midnight and i know he will drive the hour or two it will take to see me if he felt like he needed to and i think I would really want to die for burdening him like that but i feel like if i do not talk to someone I am going to fucking explode. i just want to die idk what else to say,1
"I left home yesterday with the intention of not coming back. After hours of driving around and mentally going to hell and back, I did come home.

Please help me. I just cannot fucking deal with it anymore,1
it hurts so much knowing i was the reason you were scared and worried. You should not love me. I am not a good person. I did this to you and still want to die even now. it would be so much easier if you just did not care about me. Why do you have to care so much? I wish you did not. Then i would not feel bad dying. And you would not feel sad about me dying. I still want to die so so badly but how can uou still care about me and say you love me? I am selfish and undeserving of it. Why cannot you stop caring about me? Why do i still want to die even knowing how badly it would hurt you? I am so sorry. This is why i need to die.this just proves how horrible and selfish i really am. Wanting to die even with wonderful friends around me who care. I am sorry I wish you did not care,1

It would seem like life is getting better but only later you realise, this was to hurt you all the way along.It is said that when my mother was pregnant, the doctor said I was not gona make it. Out of the odds I came out alive just to witness this pain? The person I loved the most, I person I begged for everyday in my prayers, the only thing I had in my life left me saying I am not enough. I was happy for 4 years I thought all my suffering was worth this happiness but in the end everything is a lie and she came into my life only to leave me. It pains to a point where it is not bearable anymore. If there ever is a concept of rebirth, I wish I should not make it out of the hospital. Why would god save me just to take everything away from me. I cannot stop my tears and I cannot stop the pain which engulfs me. Please god, forgive me for whatever sin I have done and please stop this pain please! Trapped",1

"Briefly, all I want in life is pleasure. All the time. It does not matter where it comes from: games, videos, music, conversations, sex, trying new stuff.If I work or go to the gym I feel like shit because I just want some stimulus. While I am doing this, I daydream a lot about stuff that makes me ... I would not say happy, getting pleasure I guess. I tend to obsess about things for a while like a game and think about it for the entire day until I get sick of it or lose interest.it is complicated because I do not want to live like this, on this useless cycle. But I also do not want to be a conformist who only work and have no time for fun. ""Too busy to feel bored."" Yeah, no. I want my life to be pure ""ecstasy."" that is the only interesting life I can see. If I cannot have that, then I would prefer to never been born. Is this depression?",0

"I spend most of my time with family. I love them, but I do not like hanging out with family members *all* of the time. It gets draining, especially with some of the toxic family dynamics going on. All of my other friends either no longer live in my city or they have their own tight work schedules.I have tried clubbing at least three different times. I did not like it. I cannot force myself to have fun at clubs, so I have acknowledged that I just do not like clubbing and there is nothing wrong with that. I have also tried online dating, but I do not like that either. So I gave up on using OLD apps and sites. they are too frustrating.I go on solo adventures in my city, but it gets lonely at times. I just wish I had someone to hang out with. I do not care about their gender just as long as its *someone* outside of my family. I wish I had someone to hang out with",0

And I realize, the greater distance I have from them, the easier it is to let myself leave this world. It would be better for everyone too, I promise. I have been causing a lot of stress and overwhelm with horrible depressive episodes that just have not gotten better over four years (despite much treatment). I genuinely believe it is just better for me to go at this point. I have run out of options, I am tired of trying, I am tired of feeling alone. I cannot think of any reasons not to die anymore.

"Hi.About a month ago I was put on a standard dose of nortriptyline. Since then I have noticed I am waking up very early and unable to get back to sleep. I am lucky if I get 6 hours, a massive change from my usual 9 or 10.I have been on a lot of antidepressants before, and none have ever had this effect on my sleep. Is this something common to antidepressants, or nortriptyline specifically? Or is this problem unrelated to the new medication?Thanks for any help/answers. I will be seeing my psychiatrist in a few weeks so will bring it up with him as well. Can antidepressants because early awakenings?",0
"I am not actively suicidal, and I am not planning on trying to kill myself anytime within the next year or two, not until I start living on my own. The fear of failure outweighs my desire to stop living. But I have an entire plan for if/when I decide to do so. I am only 19, but I have typed out a will of sorts to let my family know how I want to be buried and where I want my money that I saved for college to go. I have a general idea of how I want to kill myself, where I want to do it, the time of day I want to do it, how Ill lie to make people not be concerned, etc. But even though this plan has only come to me within the last week, I have not been suicidal. I am just stuck in that awkward limbo where I do not see a point in living, but I do not see a point in dying. But I still cannot stop just creating this story in my mind of everything, thinking about everything that could go wrong and how I could prevent those things from happening and it does not really bother me. Its just a thought that is always in the back of my head. Anyone create elaborate suicide plans without intent to act on them?",1

I do not feel like myself and everything feels like I am in limbo, just watching my life go by. It feels like a dream.Or I get hyper aware of my bodys functions that should happen naturally. Like I am manually processing everything going through my brain. I sometimes think I can accidentally hit the off switch to my brain and it scares the shit out of me. These episodes make me get existential and I feel hopeless as a result.I do not want to die but the feeling of nothing feeling real or my hyper awareness, scares me into thinking that its going to happen soon.

"For all my life I have battled with depression. It started ever since the age of 6 when i lost all my hair due to a condition and left me inhibited and paranoid of the world. I have gotten better recently (I am 20) but i still have this extreme sensitivity to other peoples perception of me. Any sort of rejection and i go this depression pit that i cannot get out of for a while. Luckily i have not experienced any devastating events such as a death of a loved one, but i am deeply afraid when the inevitable does happen. I do not think when my parents eventually die ill be able to sustain myself. I feel like I am too fragile to live for long",0
"Okay, so my job is seriously fucking with my mental health at this point. I work as a grocery store cashier, and when I have to work the front end, its fucking miserable. Now that we do not have to social-distance anymore, the place thinks its okay to pack us employees and customers together like fucking sardines, and because I get anxiety from strangers being too close to me, I am fucking miserable. All that, on top of scanning a hundred items at a time lacking mental stimulation and draining the soul out of me to begin with. Its all just a miserable experience.I do not want to die. I really do not. I have goals and dreams, things I love about life, things that make me happy. A future to live.But I am spiraling. I cannot just get another job; between not having my drivers license and social anxiety making references an impossible thing to deal with, my literal only two choices right now are to either keep living this miserable experience or once again live a meaningless one where I lay around and do nothing with my life. I really do not want to die but I am spiraling into the belief that its going to be the only way out of this misery. Its getting worse by the week. I am actually starting to get scared of myself.But tonight, on a whim, I watched a video I took recently, of a moment where I felt truly at peace. I was playing lofi out of a speaker and laying in the grass, watching cars leave after a fireworks show.And I was reminded that its those little moments that I love so much about life. That even after a miserable shift, Ill keep getting to live these experiences if I LIVE.I am still struggling, do not get me wrong. But its things like that that help keep me afloat. I am hoping to either get my drivers license, work up the courage to talk to the HR manager about my anxiety issues (that feels less likely), or start seeing a therapist soon. kind of had a little bit of a turnaround moment",1
"Feels like I am a walking circus everyday, have not done a single noteworthy thing in my life and I think to myself ""Why do I even exist?"" I was a social outcast right from the get-go, hardly anyone liked me, so I never had many friends. I screwed myself over and burned a bridge with a friendship over 7 years. I let myself think that people just put up with me, but I am told otherwise, why do I still feel like I am just an obstacle to others around me? I have been here before, wondering why I exist, because there is nothing waiting for us at the end of the road, what is there to look forward to? I still live my parents acting like I am just getting to my teens, like I never grew up. I hardly talk to my grandfather with whom I have had bad experiences with like belly poking and point out that I am slower than a normal person...I always feel like there is a weight waiting for me to be lifted, but I can never find the effort to go lift that weight, as I feel more and more discouraged to lift it because of other things going on in my life. Needing an education, a job, have a hobby, making friends, seeing other relatives, have a routine, keep things tidy, do this, do that and the list goes on and on...How am I supposed to manage all of this? How the hell do I find the time and place...I end up shutting myself in and wallow in what my life (or lack there of) could be.Not entirely sure if this is the right sub for this post, but I just had to get this off of my chest, thank you for reading what looks to be my sad and pathetic life.

For a while now I shake randomly and it remind me of the day I took the pills. I do not know if its just me making it up or if its like from the day I overdosed and its residual. What I do know is that sometimes I want to feel the way I felt when I ODd again. At the time I was absolutely terrified, the world went black and I could not think, I could not feel and my body was not my own. Now though, I have been craving that feeling, the euphoria of not having to deal with anything. Feeling as though my problems are not mine, like I am fading out never to suffer again. I do not know why I made this post, maybe its just sheer curiosity to see if anyone else has felt the same. I do not know where else to put this.",1
"I am a person who tends to think of their feelings often, and pick them apart. Recently, I noticed that rather than my ""normal"" depressive symptoms, a run around the block of the more common issues, I have been feeling sad -- a different kind of sad than usual. Ordinarily, my sad means sensitive, easily brought down and more heavy in a general way. As of late, ""sad"" has meant crying constantly, *literally* crying myself to sleep some nights. And I do not know what changed. I am now on the verge of tears for most of the day, and I do not even have my happy moments anymore. I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago, bouncing between each specific diagnosis. Now, I am on medication that was working just fine. I have not found any new significant stressors in my life that I could identify -- the only recent change was a change in my as-needed anxiety medication. I have no idea what happened, but I do not know how to cope anymore. Has anyone else gone through something similar, where their depression suddenly twists and changes? Feeling a new kind of sad",0
"How i lost my dad3 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation. Right now I feel like I have lost the man who was on my side for the biggest part of my life. How I lost my dad",0

Here I am breaking down staring at my monitor for the voices of constant suicide does not stop for it is increasing it is magnitude the longer I feel this. This numbing pain is the worst part as it eats away every bit of sanity I have left. Day 1 of 365 days of suicidal thoughts",1
"I have been really digging deep into myself these past few months because I want to get better. I want to feel something other than inadequacy and pitifulness.Over the past few days I have come to the fact that I have an eating disorder, and I have been living with it for probably a little over 2 years and it has gotten progressively worse with age. I have also been thinking about how I talk to others. I have realised that I am too nice and I let people walk all over me, or I let mean comments pass by. I have decided I am not going to do that anymore, and when someone says something that I do not agree with, I am going to stand up for myself. I feel like a fraud. I feel like I am putting on thus facade to people to please people. Because I must admit it without being vain, I am...different than most people. I dress weird, I like old music, I am wiser than my fellow sixteen year old peers and I am a lot more articulate than my peers and that is probably because I read the classics and enjoy poetry. I am an intellectual person and in my family I am a black sheep, because everyone around me is a lot more shallow than I when speaking about topics and they just like different things than me. So when I am around other people, it is better not to speak than to say something that does not fit their norm and be laughed at and made fun of. To be honest, I would rather be alone than be in a group of people who share no interests than me. To me, that is probably the worst thing to deal with...people you just do not click with. If I could have one person who was just my other half, then I swear I would be happy for the rest of my life. That probably will not happen so I will not wish for it. I am a fraud.",0
"Hey everyone, I posted in r/Anxiety but did not get a response but the sub is not as active as this one and its also possible those who saw do not have experience with my med. My doctor prescribed me vortioxetine. Just wondering if anybody has any experience with this drug and what I should expect over the next few weeks. Thanks! On medication for the first time",0
"HiI'm like almost 30I have been socially ostracized pretty much my whole life. When I was in middle school and when the most important thing is to start having social relationships I just went to school and home, without making friendships, or love relationships. It happened the same in high school and college. In my mid teens I was feeling socially behind everyone else around me in the sense that all the other teens were having friends, social circles, love relationships etc. In college I was already socially retarded and it could be seen on me, yeah whenever there is a group there is an odd creepy autistic guy, i was that guy. Work life came after college, and in the workfield is a different story. Here people were mostly in their 30s had kids, it was no longer a place where you can interact with people who have a similar age and interests as you. I have a really hard time waking up, sleeping, going trough another day, I do feel like if i would not have to wake up and endure this hell of an existence and it would all be over.Life seems to be a social net that you have to start building up since your childhood and accumulate the key experiences at the right time. Friends, true friends, first kiss, first teenage sexual relation, etc.I have not experienced these crucial milestones. I feel dead inside. Also had multiple botched eye surgeries that left one of my eyes conjunctiva permanently red. Now people feel even more uncomfortable near me thanks to my oddly red eye. I have never been part of the world and it torments my every single waking moment",0
"I am currently in the WTF AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE PHASE, not in education, employment, or training at the moment, everything feels so dim since 2 or 3 weeks (severely depressed), Am I the only one facing this? Is anyone in the shit situation I am right in? Currently in the WTF Am I Doing With My LIFE Phase.",0
"Having one of those sleepless nights going down a rabbit hole of negative thoughts. Sometimes it is nice to be reminded that I am not the only one psychologically fucked up. So anyway, what do some of you do to keep thoughts of self hatred at bay? At this point, I hate pretty much everything about myself physically. I think my biggest problem is my level of perfectionism that I cannot shake. I know my negative qualities should not bother me as much as they do, but I cannot help feeling the way that I do. How do you deal with self hatred?",0
"I hate everything. I hate my classmates who shout and scream all the time. Leave me alone. I hate people. No one loves me. it is just fake compliments and bullshit like ""it will get better, world is beautiful"" bla bla bla. I was better when I was little. Now it is just hell. Self harming frequency went up. I self harm to eat, wash and even sleep. I need that pain. I just want to feel alive. I have no energy. Why did you make me if you are not going to love me? Fuck that. I feel so empty. I do not know why I am still alive. Want to die but too much of a coward to kill myself. Wish I was never born",1
I am done with life goodbye fuck it,1
"So I only have one sister, and growing up I have seen how different we are raised. As the eldest I am expected to learn all the household stuff, do them quietly and perfectly. But when my sister was at the age where she should have learned and done the stuff I did my mother never forced her to do any stuff (it is the culture but really? how fair is that?) Mom would also guilt trip me whenever I refused to do my sister's homework or project.I spotted a lot of difference as we grow older. Whenever their is conflict between me and my sister, no matter whose fault it was, they will side with her. Sometimes my father would just stay quiet because mom would get mad at him. that is why right now my sister thinks that she has the authority over me especially if I would defend or in their term ""retaliate"" to my parents. I am just tired with how things are at home.Just recently my sister and I fought, I am partly at fault because of my temper and I am just tired of them not remembering any of my preferences (they forget even the smallest thing about me.) I knew I am at fault too but for her to use the stuff that I fought over with my bf (she overheard it) during our fight is below the belt. so I told her that she has no right to use that against me. She burts out and threw things at me. She also tried to charged at me only to be held back by my mom. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not even have a safe space at home. I want to leave the house but if I did I can no longer supply their needs. because I have my own bills and needs to pay for... Eldest of two",1
"Untill now I was the so called ""good guy"". Always trying to be pleasant around others, always trying to help, always saying ""thank you"" and ""you are welcome"" when needed etc. Recently I decided to adopt and raise a cat. But there is something very dark that came to the surface which I did not know that existed, and I have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat, watch her squeal in fear as I am being a total piece of shit to her. First few weeks were great. I may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious. We were always sleeping together, playing together and we were practically inseparable. She was happy, and I was happy too.But once I decided to return to the house I grew up in, where some childhood trauma events have occurred, it was like a switch flipped, and I became a monster. I became very abusive towards my cat, and I have a very hard time stopping. Now I try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me, which I cannot control.And because of that, I feel like I do not deserve anyone in my life. I was being a hypocrite all along, pulling of an act, and I deserve to be alone. Hell, I feel so guilty that I want to outright die, because I cannot live with the guilt and shame because of this.I know there will be people who will hate me for what I said. And I am really scared because of what I am about to post. But then again, I have never done the right choice anyway.I deserve the hate. I am lost",1
I want it to stop. Everyone I love hates me. I am probably being cheated on. I just want to give up. I hate living.,1
I got put onto antidepressant (Zoloft/Sertraline) and in a couple days I could quickly see my sex drive diminish quickly. I can still keep an erection but it takes longer to finish. Anyone else have the same experience? I want to ease my mind on this. Antidepressants and sex drive,0
"Ok so I was bullied since I was in 1st grade. I had no friends no one liked me in school and they all used to make fun of me for being quite and ugly. it was my classmates who used to bully me. But bullying started in my bus too. I remember I was the youngest one there half of them were highschoolers. And furthermore we all lived in a same neighborhood . They bullied me for years till one of the high school girl graduated and what leaves is me and some other students they all were male. There they started sexually abusing me, they started touching me. When I was fade up with that I told everything to my mum, she was kind of person who blames the victim, she started calling me weak, saying that I cannot stand for myself, that is my fault. So I told my dad about bullying but not about the sexual abuse. Cuz I was scared. He warned them. They stopped bullying me for a while, they started it again. Luckily my father got transferred to another City, and we moved out from that city. I was glad at first thinking it will be fun making new friends at a new school. But things did not go well, again I was left alone, literally no one wanted to be friends with me. I used to eat lunch alone. Then in 6grade, some bunch of girls started bullying me, they would called me ugly, well yeah I am not good looking but that does not give them any right to bully someone. I did stand up for myself this time. But nothing worked. I complained about this to my teacher but she simply ignored me. One time some guys wrote horrible things on my books and they started stealing my stuffs. I do not know how I lived that time. This bullying effected my academic scores, I did not do well in my exams. And yeah I was dumb too, my academic scores were always less. And my parents were always disappointed in me. I never got any awards in sports or academics except an award for full attendence. I tried to skip school so many times. But my parents were strict asf, they even made me go school when I had terrible fever too. one time I had cold and somehow managed to skip school so my mum started blabbering and she started taunting me and my dad beaten the shit out of me. So I decided to never skip school after that. Then I was sent to hostel, after failing 11th grade, I repeated the class again in girls school. Well it was not that bad even tho I was left alone. But there was still some people who cared about me. And in 15yrs it was the 1st time I ever had a best friend. Well the quarantine made me close to some people as I am an introvert, with trust issues. Anyways situation is worse even today. I am suicidal and I blame my parents for that but sometimes I feel like I should not be blaming them, maybe it is me that is my fault. This year I am 18 now and I am going to be in college and I am scared, what if this happens there too? I have fought back before too but at the end they all blamed me, no one was by my side, and portrayed themselves as victims. My life is just full of shit. But still let us see how far I would go...I know there are some people like me who suffered worse. I hope you all doing well now. I Was bullied everywhere and everytime. Now I am traumatized",1
They knew I bought suicide drugs. I thank them of course for not taking it away from me.Today we again had an argument and I left the house and took it all with me. I am sitting in the shittiest flat you can possibly imagine (no fridge even) and crying because none of them called me back. it is 22:06 and I rent the flat by 09:00. I must kill myself by the morning or I have no else to go and I will not come back. I have got exactly 0 money. I have left my house with my suicide drugs and nobody stopped me. it is night already and none of them care if I die. They do not want me back.,1
"I have had no mental problems nor depression my entire life. I am perfectly happy with my life. My girlfriend however, is not doing good at all. She has a bad home life where she is neglected and treated badly by her mom and her sisters, plus her parents have recently divorced. She just told me not too long ago that she is depressed and thinks about suicide/self harm often. I have suggested therapy but she persists and tells me that she does not want to be put on medicine because that is what made her father different and led to the divorce. I have also suggested talking to a hotline but she claims that talking to the hotlines usually end in therapy too. She tells me that talking to me and me being there helps her a lot but she still has these thoughts when I am not around, making it even worse, she is away from home for a month and a half right now and it worries me because she could hurt herself or something. I feel so horrible about the entire situation and feel powerless because nothing that I do or suggest helps her get rid of this problem. Can anyone give me any tips to help me support her fight or help her to get rid of it? Thank you. Need help as soon as possible, but not for me...",0
"It can be really tough to open up about mental health struggles, or something in our lives that may because or contribute to depression. I have the faith the risk to share is in fact worth it though.Something great that happened to me recently, my friend helped me stay in a motel for a couple days, to have space from a stressful circumstance. It helped me realize I am not stuck in an endless loop of the same old, and there are things I can do which might be scary and uncertain but will also change my trajectoryI'd love to hear your encouraging stories too! What was something great that happened as a result of sharing your true experiences with someone?",0
"I feel like I have nowhere to go, I feel uncomfortable everywhere. At my house or outside, alone or with people, it is all the same: I am always uneasy, out of place, wanting to go somewhere else. I hate all the places where I exist.here is my problem: I cannot be happy no matter what I do. I want to put myself out there, try new things, be with other human beings and I just cannot bring myself to do it. I do not have it in me to survive, to keep going. I am a little weaker every day.I try to stay alive but is there really a reason to? Everything that used to make me happy now makes me sad. All the things I used to love are gone. I feel so alone. I just want friends and a hug but I cannot get it and it breaks my heart.Recently my friend's sister killed herself and I have been thinking a lot about suicide. Losing strength",1
"I am 16, 295 pounds and a dropout. I have decided that if I am to weak to self improve and gain discipline over my eating, that I will probably just end it, I am not religious so I figured that it would just end and I will not go to hell or anything, the only thing that sucks is the consciousness of it, knowing that the only two people that I care about (my mom and sister), will miss me deeply. I know these problems are nothing compared to other peoples problems on this server and they would only wish that they were in a position where they just had to eat less and make better choices, and that is why I will try my hardest to improve my self and make life worth living. Of course self improvement is a long and hard road, and I am glad the only obstacles I face is due to my stupid decisions and not because of other factors. Ill give it 10 years or so and if things get worse, then I see know point in continuing to suffer :) Probably will kill myself if I lack the will power to improve",1
"Does anyone know what to do with this? I feel really stressed out of nowhere right now, I am not breathing irragular or hyperventilating but my breath got heavier. Just all my bad memories are constantly popping up out of nowhere and it is been doing that all day. I cannot relax and feel like I am about to cry any moment but it will not come.I have never had this before. I tried looking it up but all I found was panic attacks, but I have had those before but this is different from those times.... Anyone have any idea what this is or how to calm down because I cannot function at the moment and distraction does not work either, I cannot keep myself distracted because everything brings up some stupid memory and I have been hitting my head all day to try and make it stop. Getting kind of panicked and idk what to do",0
"Now that I am in my 30s, I realise my depression maybe because by both my parents being depressed. I know genetically it can be transferred but I am wondering if nurture wise it can be passed on? I notice that I also think negatively- never solutions to problems and I know this is from my mom.My parents have no hobbies or interests and either do I but I am thinking this is because I did not grow up seeing this or being in that sort of environment. These are just 2 examples but do you think it is possible? Can having depressed parents because children to me depressed",0
"Feb 2020 and 2021 I was suicidal. 2021 I have done so much work through therapy and medication that I thought I had a good fix. I am working out regularly, losing weight etc. Probably the past month I have just felt emotionally grey and dull. I am also a teacher so this is my summer off, I feel like I should be living it up but I have no energy to do anything. Summer depression relapse",0

"I met the love of my life 5 years ago. We broke up months ago. Now I cannot live anymore. I tried for months to get over, find new people etc. But the mind synergy that we had is impossible to find. She says she still loves but cannot get back because we hurted each other so bad. She feels stuck with me and want to live. The truth is I cannot live without her and I do not want to to be a burden. So I decided that my time has come. I think Sunday will be the day The only way out",1
Idfk how or when but all I know is soon. I am done,1
"Everyday i get more and more lonelier. I have people around yes yes but not someone who is my person if that makes sense. Is it so hard to ask for someone that will be your support, comfort, best friend. Someone who keeps me going, helps me get out of depressive episodes. I just feel like I am going to go crazy and if i see one more person happy with their person I am going to cry. AHHHHH",0
"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so please bare with me. I am 23 years old and I cry almost everyday. I do not have friends and I do not understand why. Each time I have had a friend it ended because they betrayed me. Whether its spreading rumors about me, being friends with my abusive ex, or leaving me out all of the time just being plain shady. I hate my parents. I blame them for how horrible I feel about myself. they have always treated me like shit. But they think they are parents of the year because they have given me nice things. In reality my parents have mocked me crying, they have blamed me for not having friends, made fun of me for it too. They always forced me to do things I did not want to do and it never benefitted me once. Like forcing me to try out for an elite choir when I was a young kid despite my debilitating stage fright and overall just me not wanting to do it. But it does not matter to them. They cannot understand how bad of parents they were and still are. In fourth grade I moved over 1000 miles away from my hometown. I was sad and depressed and had no new friends. My grades slipped. Instead of asking me what was wrong my parents beat me until I could not sit down. One time I caught a ride instead of waiting for my mom who always moves at her own pace, to go to cheer camp. My first year on the squad. I left the house and caught a ride. My mom drove all the way up to the school embarrassed me in front of everyone and took me out of camp. She humiliated me on purpose. One time my parents forced me into a mental hospital. ON VACATION. My parents have ruined my life over their lack of compassion, quickness to anger, control issues and so much more. Its caused me to search for love from people who pretended to care about me. Now since I cut those people off I have no friends. I am out of college so making friends is impossible atp. It seems like no one wants to make new friends at my age because being clique-ish is cool. I am not going to make new friends ever. My career field is generally gate kept by older people so definitely will not have friends at work who are my age and we can hangout. Its been one year since I cut off my shitty friends and I may have only hung out with or interacted with a person my age only 3 or 4 times. Out of an entire year. 10/10 you will find me on my couch in my apartment. Everyday. I never go out even on the weekends because I have no friends. Trust me I have tried reconnecting with people I ent to school with but no one ever puts as much effort into it as I do because mostly everyone has their people already. Anyways, I just wish I could die. If nothing can change in a year nothing will ever change. Friends are not going to miraculously fall into my lap. The only happiness I get is the split second I think about dying and how when I do die Ill finally get to be happy because I will not have to care about being lonely. I hope all of you struggling right now who have friends, who have people that care about you other than your own family, cherish those people. Because something is better than nothing. And I do not have anyone. I do not text anyone during the day. No one texts me. I do not remember the last time i went to a party or the last time I was out past 7. Hopeless.",1
"I am 20. I have hated myself my entire life, and always figured I would kill myself eventually so I have made zero investments in my future. My friend died a few months ago. He hung himself. After seeing what it did to his family, friends, and honestly what it did to me, I have resigned myself to living. But I still do not want to live. I will not do anything for myself. will not help myself. Because I deserve everything I do to myself. My mom tells me I almost got hit by a truck riding my bike as a kid and sometimes I wonder if I was not supposed to die that day because its the only thing that makes sense. I fell through the cracks and now I am stuck in limbo, unable to die, unwilling to live, doing nothing but taking up space in my home, wasting my familys time and energy. Stuck in limbo.",1
"Every time I open up and actually try talking to someone, I feel like it was a horrible mistake and I should have never been honest or allowed myself to be vulnerable. I struggle with rejection, fixate on what is wrong with me, and then I question the motivation of anyone who actually wants to spend time with me. What do they gain from this? Is it simply pity that motivates them? I think the reason I feel so disgusted with myself (part of it anyway) after I share my feelings with people is that I have basically blown my cover and revealed myself as being horribly insecure, unhappy, and unstable making me about as unappealing as possible to be around. it is a cycle of despair; I feel alone, reluctantly confide in people, and time after time, watch those people disappear. I return then to this fixation on my flaws and ultimately, arrive at the conclusion that I need to suffer in silence or at best, in anonymity. How do people live like this? A feeling of overwhelming shame and disgust for being vulnerable",0
"I have known for a while that what I really want is to be dead. Unfortunately, I have been forced to stop considering this as an option due to certain reasons. Living in this world knowing all I want is to be dead makes everything pointless. I am forced to keep this body alive. I do a little more than what is necessary to survive.I mean, how can anyone genuinely look at the future and see anything worthwhile? What do you people fucking see? What in the hell do you get out of bed for? And the worst part of all this is that no matter how many times I try to think a way of this, I end up getting nowhere. Because there is nowhere to go. There is no such thing as a life worth living. The tomorrow I am working towards will never come.This cycle never ends. I will continue to come to the realization that I do not belong here and then right after come to the realization that there is nothing I can do about it. I will continue to be frustrated by the futility of my efforts. I will continue to try out of an obligation. And I will continue to get absolutely fucking no where.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Cheers to working towards a tomorrow that will never come!!!

"I want to first apologize if this post seems all over the place. there is so much to say, but Ill try to sum up what is been going on. I am a 20 year old female. For a long time, I have felt that suicide was inevitable for me. Growing up I was bullied and ostracized. Even as young as 9 years old, I felt that things would be better had I not been born. My mother was physically abusive and is still emotionally abusive. Phrases like fuck you and go to hell still stick out in my mind from recent years. Recently, she said to me during an argument that I make her life difficult and that I never think about how she feels dealing with a suicidal daughter. In my later high school years, I thought I had found the friend I had always wanted, only for her to gaslight and guilt trip me during another time I felt like ending my life. Only a month and a half ago, one of my best friends blocked me and another friend in our group over a petty disagreement and still continues to ignore us both. As for seeking help, I have been going to therapy for three years and I feel like I am only getting worse. I just do not know what to do. I look in the mirror and do not even recognize myself anymore. I had so many goals when I was a kid. I wanted to sing, to be a rockstar. I wanted to make my dreams come true, find love, be successful. I was the type of person to go out of my way to do something just because someone said I could not do it. My choir teacher told me Id be better off as an artist, painting and drawing. I went and sang the solo for my senior year concert. I was going to work towards being a freelance model, and started working with some friends who were photographers. I did not think I would ever truly give up on myself.Now all I do is spend my days in bed, browsing endless feeds, wasting hours away with video games. I have never been in a relationship, and have turned down men all because I fear Ill mess something up or do something embarrassing. My social anxiety has gotten so severe that I am afraid to even walk outside my own backyard for fear of people seeing me. Even though I am introverted, I have always loved spending time with my friends. Now I do not even have the energy to go out anymore, and I miss them all dearly. There are so many things that scare me in life, and as much as I want out, I am afraid of the pain that comes with death. At least once every two weeks or so, I spend time looking for suicide methods. And every time I feel like Ill never find an easy, painless way out. And if I were to survive, the consequences of whichever method I chose scare me even more. I want to reach out to friends but I do not want to worry them or put this burden on their shoulders. I feel stuck. I am too afraid to live and too afraid to die. I Feel Like Suicide Is Inevitable For Me",1
i reeeeally want to off myself but i always end up backing out of it i wish i was not such a coward about it I am tired of being here,1
Its been about 9 years in therapy and I still want to die. My life is awful. Nothing has gotten better. I do not know what to do anymore. I was clean of self harm for years but I am so desperate I tried and even that did nothing. Smoking does nothing. Drinking does nothing. Nothing does anything anymore. My life is in shambles and literally no one can reasonably give me the support I need. I am so alone and I do not know what to do anymore. I do not know what to do,1
:(( And it is back to reality tomorrow,1
I have been taking my meds and since then my depression has kind of frozen. I did not feel anything and was complaining numb and disassociating. When I told my doctor this he decided to bump me down with the dosage so now I started feeling less numb but with that I feel more depressed and unstable. My self harm urges are gradually getting bigger and bigger and my nights are getting longer each day. I am honestly terrified to start school again because if I am feeling unstable now.. who knows how bad it will hit me then. Its all coming back,0
"Not having a good night in regards to the suicidal thought front but will probably be ""ok/survive"". I have been suicidal for a long time, not my first rodeo. It tends to come in two phases the first phase is passive and that is pretty normal for me and is just rather uncomfortable/inconvenient but the second phase tends to be potentially very dangerous and is phase one plus a perceived loss of control in regards to the suicidal thought and is significantly rarer. I have always assumed that if my control hits zero an attempt is imminent and I will not really get a say in the matter. I have never gotten to zero control before but I have gotten real close on a handful of occasions. Definitely dipping into second phase tonight. Honest question... When should you ""really"" go to emergency for suicidal thought?",1
Hey guys I am new here so I really do not know what I should talk about. I am 19 years old and I am suicidal. Every night I try to kill myself but end up failing badly that which frustrates me. Yesterday was the day that it finally dawned upon me that I wanted to end it all. I have never had anyone to get me through this except for myself and my bipolar disorder. Not even my family try or reach out to me so I am hoping to get good advice here on Reddit. Well mainly because it is my Dad causing these suicidal tendencies. I cannot even do the things I love anymore. I cannot even enjoy one of my games properly because of these thoughts of feeling utterly useless. I hope this reaches out the people that can help me. Because I truly am suffering. 19 years Old Suicidal,1

Okay I took 10 20mg fluoxetine and now I am regretting doing so because I really do not want to go hospital will I be able to sleep it off? Or will I die. Please someone help me as I really cannot go to the hospital so any advice on how to stop the effects will help. Thank you I took 10 20mg fluoxetine/Prozac and now regretting it.,1
"I feel like there is no point to my life. I am 31. I have no family, no home, no career. I do not have a good relationship with my mother, who will be dead soon. I have one friend who I almost never see. I am in a relationship with a person who wants nothing to do with me and thinks I am a burden. I moved away from my life to be with them and now I am just here to pay rent. I am working a job a do not care about and have no other jobs I could possibly care about. I have no connections or goals for my future. The only thing I could ever want is a little home on my own and because I am poor that seems impossible. Every person I have ever been close too has treated me like shit. I have been used my whole life and I have no hope that I will ever meet anyone who will not do the same. I do not enjoy any part of life. Occasionally its so absurd that it makes me laugh but that is not enough to keep going. I am tired of suffering and I know things will only get worse. I am only going to be uglier and sadder. Less lovable and easier to manipulate and use. The thought of suicide is so comforting. Life is pointless",1
"My life is going nowhere. I cannot see myself happy in the future. I am a burden to my parents. Surrounded with assholes who just laugh and are glad that I am in pain. Told a friend about my mental state, next time I met him.... he was shouting/telling our conversation in a room full of people ( batchmates, juniors). What an asshole. I have sensed that some of my friends have just cut contacts with me ever since they came to know that I might take a step. I have one friend whom I tell everything, but every time I call him, it is about my mental state. I do not want to pester him as what choices I make, will not affect him, why it will. Nobody gives a damn about anyone.The things I used to enjoy, are not enjoyable any more. I do not think about how to make myself better. No goal directed actions. Short term motivation-only lasts for 1-2 weeks. I just cannot take it any more. I just want to break free from all this. Everybody I know just look down on me, like I am nothing. My friends, sheer assholes. I have cut all contacts with them. Sleep and awake, all changed. I sleep when ever I want, how long I want.Had a girlfriend, but she left me a year ago saying that I am a loser and I had no future. I was emotionally dependent on her, but she just shattered me emotionally. I am a sensitive person. I am too emotional. I am too friendly. I am looking for options to end my life. I just want it to be quick, painless.I have few high rise buildings near my residence. But only thing that stops me is my mother, I know she will be devastated. Hopeless,",1
"I am paranoid about hearing thingsi was diagnosed with severe anxiety just over a year ago, which led to me being diagnosed with depression in november 2020. i live with both my parents, however they are either at work or they isolate themselves because they are hard workers and they work better when they are alone. most of the time I am in my room either listening to music, playing video games or just messaging people. however just over a month ago, I have started getting paranoid about hearing things. i am deadly frightened of clowns for some weird reason i do not know why and i can sometimes hear clown laughs coming from downstairs, probably injected through my history on the internet. i know for a fact there is no clown in my house as my dads workspace at home is downstairs and he has never had claimed of hearing such stuff. i am also sometimes mistaking my heartbeats for footsteps, but when i hear real footsteps its hard to point out the difference. I am living in a nightmare in my own house, and I am terrified of these issues. any tips? my paranoia",0
"I see them texting each other talking shit about me right next to me, and they screenshot my Snapchat story to show to each other and laugh at me over. My mom even shames me whenever I bring up food or eating. I know they would not care if I was gone. They used to be all I have, now they are just against me. I am stuck on a vacation with them right now and I have no way of escaping except the bottles of meds in my suitcase My family all hate me",1

"I honestly do not think Ill ever be good at doing anything in life or at least anything that will make myself a living. I am upcoming on my 7th year in college at a dead end up working for a family member that made me feel like shit for the past 5 years. I have no self worth, I am the fattest I have been in my life, and waste all the money I get from my job on my car and going out anyways. Realistically, I do not know how Ill survive in the future. I do not see myself being able to hold onto a job or even getting close to the dreams I used to have. Sure the people in my life may care about me, but I almost do not care about myself anymore. If the only reason why I have to keep on living is because people will be sad to see me go, should I still really be around? I just want to quit living already",0
"Currently 17 close to 18, and I hate everything about myself. I hate the way I look, how I feel, and my anxiety is slowly killing me. I feel constantly judged all the time and never feel like I am good enough for anyone not even myself. I live a decent life but I have nothing going for me. I have not been happy in almost 4 years now, there is nothing I do that makes me happy. I do not have a life worth living. The girl I feel so passionate about is with someone else and i hate it. I do not feel like I am good enough for anything. I am just so tired of living through the same day over and over. I do not feel like my life is as worth it as people say it is. Everyone always tells me it gets better and if I wait good things are coming for me but they have not and it does not seem like they will. I hate myself and my life",1
"I feel like there is no good way of describing how I am feeling to people who do not get it. I have absolutely no desire to participate in normal life anymore. Any social event I have to participate in is almost 100% faked. Every small setback just makes me give up even more. I have to hold back tears almost all day every day. But I feel like I cannot call in sick to work because they will just call me lazy and emotional. So now it is ""a really bad headache"" or a ""migraine"" that sends me to my dark quiet bedroom for the rest of the night. People can relate to headaches and do not try and tell you to just ""stop having headaches."" at this point I barely still give a shit about pleasing other people but I still do for now. Maybe if life gets a little worse I will be less afraid to just say ""it is taking everything in my power to just get out of bed every day."" and not give two shits about whether they believe me or relate to me anymore. Just telling people it is a headache from now on.",0
I almost killed myself last night. Then I almost cut myself again. Then I was lonley. No one cares for me. They hate me as I tag along with them sticking to them like glue. Everyone I meet quickly starts to dislike me and distances thenselves from me. I cannot do anything about it. The only way I can change my personality is if I am quiet and shy. And they still hate me because sometimes the old me comes back. Its bullshit. I hate me I almost jumped in front of a car last night,1
"For the longest time I have been very very depressed. my Depression started when I was probably in elementary school. I was sent to the counselor's office because I looked sad or I was acting sad or I was not participating in class because I was so overwhelmed with my emotions. My father has always been completely distant, shows no emotion except for when he was hitting me. My mother was fucked up on drugs and alcohol and physically and emotionally abused me. Her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.I developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because I was so sad or sick. When I would get an each ache or strep, I would get punished (month long+ groundings, beatings, name calling)My mother tortured me when I came out to her as gay in 2003. She sent me to multiple doctors and told everybody in our closed-minded, racist, homophobic family that I was gay. She also kicked me out of the house at 17. I ended up leasing a cheap SRO studio in Chicago so I could have a roof over my head. I paid for that rent with my job at Best Buy. I still do not know how I did it, but I didFast forward to 2015. I went through a bad breakup and ended up doing cocaine almost every night on top of my raging alcoholism in order to cope and numb the feelings. 2016 I started doing heroin occasionally\[and now I do it almost every day -- its been like this since September 2020\]Despite all of this, I was still dating because I thought that finding a partner would fix everything.I met the person who I thought would be my partner for life in 2018. Even though he ghosted me on my birthday, then ghosted me again at thanksgiving that same year I still kept coming back. I love him so much, but I do not understand why.At the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and I moved in with him. We slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.I loved being with him all the time. But the feeling was not mutual.My partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. I admitted to him that I had been doing heroin almost every night in December 2020. I pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that I was going to rehab as soon as my FMLA benefits were active so I could go to rehab. I wanted to be honest and open, and I was.On March 2nd of this year, I told my partner that I would be starting treatment on March 16. I was very proud of myself for doing this. He, however, flipped out on me and told me that I needed to move out. Now I had to drop out of the rehab program so I could find a new apartment and pay for the move. This led me to spending most of my money on heroin.I expressed to my ex back in March that I was very suicidal. He told me I would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.I still see him a few times a week. Why, though?Anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. The only reason I have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and I do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody I know.But I guess it does not matter on my end. Ill never see these people again, right?I am quite sure that I am going to be done with all of this by the end of July. I cannot take life anymore. Humans are horrible.tl;dr: I am a 35 year old gay man who has been experiencing depression for the last 25 years or so. I am also an addict. The one person that I love broke up with me in March right before I was scheduled to go rehab. I have nothing now except sadness and anxiety. I cry myself to sleep every night. people are poison",1
"i just really do not have anything else. no one listens to me when i say i cannot just be positive or when i tell them id rather die then transition most if not all of the time. there is not anything i can accomplish that i feel confident enough in to dedicate my life and time to work towards. so i do not see any reason to live most if not all of the time.i do not want to have to dilate my vagina weekly. id honestly prefer a menstrual cycle. at least then i would not have to die with the secret embarrassment that i have felt bad about not being able to start a biological family with a partner. its not even something i want. its something i silently beat myself up for not being able to give to someone else if it was something they dreamed of. another possible let down of being in a relationship with a fake woman like me.i do not want to have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to change my face and body just to feel vain and petty. because i know it will not make me happy. and everyone just seems to get mad with me for talking about it. like they can tell me, a trans woman, how to view the extent of modern medical gender transitioning. i cannot just get silicone tits and be miraculously happy for everyone else to see. i cannot just be told that all these things are what it means to transition from male to female over and over when to me its literally not. I am forever trapped in a way that just makes me feel stupid. i think I am losing the battle with myself.",1
"I wrote a suicide note 27 days ago and it is just kind of been something that I have been thinking about doing for a while now. I am just really done with everything, and this constant feeling of loneliness that I have. July 9th seemed like a good day. Today is my ex's birthday, and I did not want to make her sad or like traumatized by doing it today, and I have been managing to put on a fake face just to keep her and the one or two other people in my life satisfied and thinking I am getting better. I do not really know how I want to do it, just know that I want to. In high school, my friend did it by jumping off the top level of a parking garage. I was thinking the same thing, but I am also scared. I think deep down, I want to live, but it is just kind of overshadowed by all the pain I feel in my life. Maybe a helium bag or shotgun would be a better idea, lol. Both are easily accessible, ironically enough.To give context, no, I am not dumb enough to kill myself over a breakup. Just, that was a tipping point that really set in just how shitty my life is. I think I might go through with this",1
"I do not want to kill myself. Sometimes I wish I stopped existing but I still want to live. I just do not feel like I am living anymore, just alive. I do the same thing pretty much every day. I am slowly losing all motivation to work out, interact with my friends. I just tell myself ""of it gets really bad and life hurts too much, you can always kill yourself :) because nothing *really* matters, right?"" Is it normal to think about suicide every day? Like does everyone do it and just collectively not talk about it or am I an outlier?",1
"I was born with a broken brain. I had very severe OCD as a child, which consumed all of my thoughts and made me very depressed and ruined my childhood. I showed signs of depression when I was six. I remember not wanting to live when I was *six-years-old*. How fucked up is that? This of course continued throughout my teen years. Lots of OCD symptoms were gone (some still remain) but the depression and anxiety just got worse. Same thing as an adult. I am 29 now, and I do not know how much longer I can go on. The last three years of my life have been hell. A lot of things have happened that I had no control over. My love life has never been great. Finally, I met the man of my dreams four months before the pandemic. Long story short, the pandemic complicated a lot of things, he broke up with me, we had to live together for a month after and he turned into a different person during that time. It was shocking. He was so *mean* to me. I just tried to stay out of the way and not be a burden. He never apologized and continues to break my heart in many different ways. Whenever I try to explain this situation to anyone, I always get a lot of ""tough love"" and harsh comments that just do not help and they make things worse. I do not need coddling, but I have gone through every scenario in my head while lying awake at night. Those comments are things I have already said to myself a million times and I do not need someone else saying them to me too. People also think the relationship thing is trivial. It is, but to me, it is not. Some people's life goal is to have the career they want. My goal is to find a loving partner to share life with. I am fine with my career right now. I think both goals should be respected, but often times, my goal is not. that is far from the only thing. I have PMDD, which makes me suicidal before my period. A lot of deaths of people close to me have happened. I have had issues with unstable housing (landlords selling and kicking me out). My catalytic converter was stolen and it cost 3k. I even saw part of the theft while walking to my car. There is so much more, but I do not want to bore anyone. Something happened recently and my friend was like ""Why are not you freaking out?"" and it was because I was just used to bad things happening to me. Even my therapist was like ""Wow, that is a lot of stuff in a short amount of time"" (there are a lot of things I have not listed in this post). I know many people have it a lot worse than me. For some reason, my mom likes to bring that up to ""cheer"" me up but it just makes it worse. I do not want other people to suffer and it makes me sad to hear about their suffering. It seems like all there is is bad news in the world. I have tried to be proactive about reading positive things, but honestly, there is not a lot. My job involves reading and writing about real murders all day. I love my job and I am happy to have it, but this takes it is emotional toll too. But it is really not about how many bad things happen to me, it is the fact that no matter how hard I try, my brain cannot react in the correct way. Things gnaw at me that a ""normal"" person can cope with and handle. The PMDD makes it so I cannot see ANY goodness at all. I am blinded by sadness and anger. I have tried to fight it, but my hormones are stronger than me. I try so hard to fix myself--I see a therapist regularly and I take the medication I have been prescribed dutifully, but for some reason, my brain just cannot make me feel good. I get accused a lot of not trying to be happy. I wish they knew how hard I have tried every single day. The PMDD also makes me extremely suicidal. For a week every month, I am in a war with my mind. I try to fight against the urge to do it. But every month I feel like I am getting weaker and weaker, and I am afraid my mind is going to win soon. This post is all over the place, sorry. I am not sure I can keep doing this.",1

I am considering getting surgery to fix my face but at the same time I am too scared to do it3. I feel like an idiot for being slow and not understanding many things I see. I want to be a part of the conversation but I am too afraid to ask because I might get bullied for not understanding something. 4. I suffer from a lot of health issues and most of my health problems are on my skin which makes me insecureAll of these reasons are taking a toll on me, ik my problems might not sound as bad as other problems which makes me feel bad about myself, I feel like a spoiled brat complaining about problems that might sound unrealistic, I am sorry if it sounds that way I am trying to be a better person and get over things because I am told to just get over it so I am trying but its hard At this point, the suicidal thoughts are carved into my head, they just will not go away, it feels like I could escape them for a short time if I harm myself maybe I keep having suicidal thoughts all day everyday for multiple reasons",1

"My journey was not easy, and it is not over yet. But I am better, something I still cannot believe today. Anyways, here are principles that I have come to realize and want to share to everyone in the hopes that these will get you out.1. Family is what you make it. Choose them, not stick with them. But be civil still2. People around you are either one of these two: people to nurture/love or objects to use. When I said objects to use, I mean those people that drag you down or does not think of you as important. You should not let them affect you but make the most use of them.3. Just go with what life throws. Be stubborn. If you want something to happen, just keep doing it. you will either die trying and sad or be happy when you finally get what you want. Either way, you get something you want. Either healing or death.4. Make the most of your strengths. This includes faking, pain tolerance (emotional) etc. These things are our demons but we can use these to our advantage. Remember, there are two kinds of successful people. Those who made it by shining bright, and those who made it quietly, in the shadows. Positive and negative. I know this may be confusing, as English is not my first language. This may also sound bitter. But hey, this got me out. Take it with a grain of salt. What I learned throughout my journey to overcome depression",0

I was fine with it until I realized they were lying about it. I had the proof. Proof somewhere, proof everywhere. Everyone Id told said it was ridiculous. I said it was fine.Until I looked at the proof. That spiraled into getting a binder to hold the proof. A notebook to write down times, a box of paper clips to hold proof together, a box of sticky notes to annotate my work lists and proof. I called off yesterday. I stayed up all night; the tv yelling at me, bugs crawling on me, my husbands itching disturbing me. It was rough, and it happened again last night, I did not get to sleep until 5ish am. But I got up dreading life at around 8am. The people at work are staring at me, my bosses plotting against me, my coworkers talking about me. I cannot handle this. I just want to sleep forever but I cannot even get to sleep in the first place. Post Title (Required)",1
"Is that I remember when it was different. Like 3 years ago, my life was about the same as it is now, but I remember enjoying things? I used to like meeting new people, I used to love going to movies and reading books. I ate, cried, and slept the normal amount. I feel like I am working so hard to get back to that (therapy, meds, exercise, etc) but starting to lose hope The worse part for me",0

"I feel the world is very bleak and my personal future seems bleak even though I live ""comfortably"" with every convenience within my reach and in a first world country etc. I would not call this depression as I feel extremely lucid and clear thinking despite experiencing lethargy regularly (I believe this is due to working nights rather than my mental state). I want to prosper but also kind of do not really see the point at the same time. It all feels pointless and wasteful continuing my life of (mostly just) meaningless consumerism. The internet reminds me how bleak the world is regularly. I guess I do have too much screen time. I am pursuing self-improvement and long term goals but at the same time, regularly think about throwing myself off a particular cliff that I know of in my country (my ideal spot). I picture this regularly. Some terrible things have happened/ are happening to me lately including: \- my 2 closest relatives getting seriously ill (likely cancer, one recurring cancer and one cancer in an organ which has been weakened over time from other serious illness)\- someone died in front of me at work while I was holding his hand and talking to him \- my partner's mother died\- my old family dog is dying\- I was bullied at my job \- I hate my job \- I have no clear alternative to my current job\- I am not happy with my appearance (I have been pursuing plastic surgery but also think this is pointless and a waste of money, materials and resources)&amp;#x200B;Sorry for the ramble. I will probably delete this but I am curious about what a reaction would be like. Have had regular suicidal thoughts for around two years and they are increasing in regularity",1
"I do not hate being alive. I just hate living. I feel like I cannot do anything right no matter how hard I try. I tend to mess something up in one way or another and I am just trying to survive. I drive my car trying to get from one point to another in a rural area with no public transportations, my car breaks.I drive my dads truck, and it rains, living in a hilly spot, the traction control comes on, and now the tires smell and have a white smoke coming from them, even after the traction control disengaged.I had to grocery shop and I was just trying to get the usual. I got pickles and then putting them in the truck something broke so now there pickle juice all over a 50lb bag of salts that is for our cows. Of course the bag was paper so the juice leaked through. And of course trying to get the giant box of cat little out of this truck I am not used to I smacked my lip and busted it open. These were just my blunders from this morning. The list goes onIm just tired of doing stuff. Everything I do something, bad things keeps happening and I am tired of feeling like a burden, I waste money I break stuff. And all I am trying to do is live with the same knowledge that was given to my peers. I wish I could just some doing thing and making decisions and have everything done for me. Then I could do nothing wrong. Fuck my lip hurts. I hate having to live.",0
"I have been thinking more about self harm. When I find it hard to sleep I think about the box cutter in my drawer next to my bed and I like to imagine cutting myself. Thinking about things like how I could make a show out of me dying and I can make it all dramatic and saddening and eventful and make the people who knew me hurt even if its only for a little bit and they will forget me and live normally like I never existed. I have had these thoughts for years but they have gotten more realistic lately.I have not done anything yet because I am a coward, but it just keeps coming to mind. Its not even out of a huge hatred for myself or others. I do not even hate my life, but I have just felt like nothing matters and nothing will ever matter for me. I do not hate anyone or myself. I just think I do not matter. there is no point to any of this.I do not think Ill be dead soon. Or even hurt in any way. I hate pain. But if anyone has something interesting or life changing to say I want to hear it. I want something to matter before its too late I do not know",1
"Have any of you experienced something like this?I have been feeling super numb emotionally. I am not me anymore. The world around me is not the same. No matter what I do - eat chocolate, meet friends, exercise, pet animals, go swimming, buy clothes - nothing makes me feel a tinsiest bit better. And I LOVED to do those before. Thing is, I cannot even feel sadness. My friend told me how she nearly drowned 2 times last week, and I did not feel anything. I cannot take it anymore. Its been more than 2 years. I was 19 when I first got it. Now I am 22. I had to drop out of med school (which was 95% of my life), wanted or not lost touch with most of people there, I loved taking photos, now its a chore. I have tried MANY antidepressants but from what I found out ssris/snris even make people without this issue numb. I have no desires, hopes, dreams, goals and man, did I have lots of them. I am going to therapy but I do not believe it will work. I have forgotten so much what is it like to feel good, I do not even miss it anymore. How can I miss something I do not even remember. I am also apathetic and do not feel like I want to get better. I take ads and do therapy just in case. On reddit there is so many stories with people being like this for 10 and more years, It robbed me off all hope. If that turns out to be my life as well then why was I even born. No emotions left?",0
"I created a reddit account just to have some place to talk to. I am a lower-middle class white kid, i live at home with 2 parents both with jobs. I have mediocre grades and a job. Why the fuck are not I happy??I strive for these things, but when i get them i still do not feel full at the end of the day. I have felt like I am in a loop for weeks maybe months now, I have been considering suicide more than ever. I do not hate my body, I do not hate other people, all i want is to step out of this never ending feeling. Being bi-polar has never helped my case, I am just really really tired yknow? there is no point I do not even know",1
"I really just want to get this off my chest and not be met with the same exact response that my friends and family have. it is not like my situation is particularly worse than anyone else's. I come from a middle class home, have parents that really care about me, and somehow still have friends that care too. I had great grades in middle school and through jalf of high-school with little to no effort being put in on my part, and even had a pretty good amount of friends. But for some reason at around early junior year in high school I just started to feel different. And at the time that was the only way I knew how to explain it. I was simply not feeling like myself. I found myself not doing homework more and more instead of finishing it all in the last 10 min of class like I usually did. I found myself more and more dresding social interaction with everyone, from my friends to my parents to even my gf. It did not start all at once and instead grew steadily over time, and because of that, I think I started to blame my surroundings in search of why I might be acting so differently. I was/am (I do not know about now) a pretty intelligent person in general. Not to say I am better or inately smarter than anyone, but school always came easy to me growing up and because of that I found myself surrounded by some truly brilliant people... that I compared myself to constantly. The thing is that at first it actually served to bolster my confidence a lot. I would see the smartest kid in my grade and my good friend K make a 96 on a test and look at my 90 and think ""wow, I am in the same league as him, I must be smart"". So when I started to make 80's, 70's, or fail the occasional assignment outright, I took it as me failing to be good enough. It made me feel as though they were better than me and that I was simply not as good as them. But I think what really drove my anxious thoughts to a truly unhealthy point was when I started worrying about what they thought of me. I constantly worried about what my friends with near perfect sat scores and literal genius level iq scores thought about me, thinking that if I did not continue to make good grades like them, they would see me as weird or a bad influence or just someone who was undesirable to be around. My intelligence ended up betraying me in the end because I started cheating really really well. I will not go into detail because I am really not proud of it now, but I got really good at cheating. I began cheating on most tests and quizzes and cheating on every homework without fail. It helped keep my head above water through my junior year making all A's and B's which was good enough for my parents (most of the time) and put to rest my anxiety about what my friends thought about me. However, I knew what I was doing and it wore on me. How I could I go from legitimately slaying in the classroom... to this. In short i started to hate myself for what I was doing but saw no way out because it was that or be tormented by the other thoughts. Eventually I snapped and the pressure just made me break. I gave up completely, feeling like a waste of space for letting everyone (including myself) down. I stopped doing assignments all together instead opting to watch YouTube through the 8 hour school day and play video games the second I got home as a way to make the days go by quicker and to chase away of of these thoughts. My parents being the great people they are really tried to make their divorce as non impactful on their parenting as they could, and continued to try things like therapy, anti-depressants, involving other family members, and even letting live with my dad for a time to see if that helped. It did not. I felt the exact same and ended up feeling worse afterwards because I blamed myself that all of their effort went to waste on someone like me. I only managed to graduate because they managed to transfer me to an ""alternative leaning school"" 3 days before covid made the schools shut down nation wide. All this meant was that cheating became 10x easier and faster, leaving more time for video games and YouTube. While all of this was going on, I thought I would be a fantastic idea to get an online girlfriend that lived literally 1,000 miles away that i would not be able to see for at least a year, after talking to her for only a few months. I met her on an online game that we both played through a mutual friend and at first she was great. Funny, smart, quirky, cool, great music taste etc. Basically what I at the time thought to be the whole fucking package. Now we live together in my mom's house and in my time living with her I have grown more attached to her good qualities and painfully aware of her bad ones. She is by no means a bad person but rather a deeply troubled and traumatized girl with so so so much heart... and I can barely handle it. Her past trauma with her alcoholic family including but not limited to being shit faced for the first time at age 12, breaking up fights between her COMPLETELY shifted parents and older sister, her older sister and mother verbally abusing her, her family never taking her to the dentist or doctor etc. Honestly I could go on and to make it worse she survived all of that while defending her younger brother who is 7 years younger than her, from as much as she could by herself. I know, it makes what I am going through seem small but because of her past, she can sometimes be really hard person to live with. She can get really really angry at small things (to the point where she gets in my face and calls me a peice of shit and blocks my exit so I cannot leave), has really bad impulse control and let us her eating and spending get out of control frequently despite very badly wanting to do the opposite, has a pretty hard time taking no for an answer. Break up with her. Right? At least that what I would say to someone if I heard about that. I would say if you are not happy, or getting what you need out of a relationship there is no reason to put yourself through that kind of strain. The thing is, she is a really really sweet person who always manages to make me laugh, always notices when I am not feeling happy, surprises me with little displays of affection, and is almost always willing to come to the table and talk about what is going on and what we can do to fix it. She shares most of my interests and what she is not really that invested in, she learns about anyway and let us me show her and genuinely gives me her full attention when I talk about them. I end up feeling conflicted inside all of the time around her. it is really been wearing on me lately and in the last few months and I just do not know what to do. But wait... there is more! On top of all of that bullshit college is starting soon and I am extremely anxious about messing that up too. I fully understand the importance of college and the effect it can have on your future career and that makes it all the harder on me mentally. I am just tired of feeling like a disappointment and so desperately want to feel like I used to: competent. If you slogged through that word vomit and are reading this now all I have to say is thank you. Any advice or kind words are welcome but not necessary at all. Tldr: I made some really poor choices and feel too anxious and depressed to do anything about it. Made this account so my gf would not see this post. Just a sad story with a lot of self pity thrown in. (This going to be a really long post and I am sorry)",0
Yeah it is my question and I am going through it too . I do not know what one week I feel so energetic and be productive and the next week I get too negative and stop doing things . Does anyone ever get out of this cycle completely ? Do people ever get out of this endless loop completely ?,0
"Depression is an old friend at this point. I do not even remember what its like for my brain to be normal. That said its been getting a lot darker these days and so I guess I am hoping putting this out there helps or something. I do not know what the hell to do anymore.To shorten a very long story, I am a single dad stuck at home 100% of the time with 3 kids. Ex left me for a old boyfriend, sucked but whatever I got over it. I was able to work from home and help take care of the kids, keep things normal-ish. Thank God for my parents. Without their help Id have gone insane or more likely put a bullet in my mouth a long time ago.Things were going ok ish until covid. Suddenly the kids are stuck home all the time, bored and driving me crazy. Their mom is flaking out again so I am without much help. My oldest son is a nightmare. Long gone is the sweet boy I knew and hes replaced with a narcissistic psychopath. Yeah, yeah I know all teenagers are bad but no. I legitimately use the clinical definition of psychopath here. I 100% think hes about one life crisis away from the beginning of a Netflix true crime documentary on a serial killer.We tried therapy but it does not help. Hes a master at lying, deflecting and putting on whatever mask he thinks will work best for you at this moment. After the 3rd time he did not come home and the cops brought him back we had him go to an inpatient facility for teens. We all breathed a collective sigh. Finally peace for us and maybe just maybe he will get some help. Nope a few weeks later hes back and has not changed.For a while he was able to live with his mom most of the time. But her new marriage imploded and now she is quasi homeless. Great now I am back to them all being here 100% of the time, no end in sight. My parents can take the younger 2 for brief stints but cannot handle him, nor do I want them to have to.So here I sit at my kitchen table, staring down the barrel of at least 5 more years of this shit. I have a nicer prison than most I guess. Still able to work, buy shit for hobbies that I do not give a shit about anymore, sunlight and fresh air.I do not actually want to kill myself but dark thoughts are no stranger, and I am getting more comfortable with not being alive. Even started thinking about what ifs for after I am gone. The only comfort I get these days is eating so I figure my heart will give out within the next decade and solve the problem for me if things do not change.Well there it is, there is my story and yeah I do not feel any better. Hell I am not sure why I thought I would. I do not feel period these days. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk or something. Trapped",0
"If you could right a will or something that you wanted that so they do not get in trouble for the rest of their life. Idk what ways they would do it, but maybe take you out back and you are kneeling and they just shoot ya in the back of the head so you do not need it coming.Maybe not so easy if you are perfectly healthy, the docs would not help you unless cancer and terminal, but if i ever got old and cannot walk, cannot see, need a nurse to wipe my ass, Id rather be taken out back to the barn so to speak. If they ever made assisted deaths a thing by doctors what about letting a friend/family murder you?",1
"I really wanted to go to my newly-discovered favorite shop by myself tomorrow, I have got some ideas of nice things I wanted to get that might help make me feel better, in an area that feels good and right. I think I need to make it through the night so that I can do that. If I do stupid things tonight, then I cannot go. If I hurt myself too badly I cannot go. If I do something stupid I cannot go. I need to at least make it through for that. I think I want to do this tomorrow..",1
"I am so disappointed, with myselfI was out with the girl I like today, like I make her I guess comfortable, but in the end she was ooking another guy, I mean like she was playing.

"My life feels to be falling apart. I do not know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. I do not have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I am wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I have tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. I cannot figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I did not recognize as I have gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I do not care to talk about anything I am interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just do not care and I do not want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. I do not care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I am just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it does not feel as...there? It feels like I am wearing emotion-canceling headphones. it is all still there, but it is so muted. I cannot stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...I have lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just do not care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I do not care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I have already failed, I still fail. So what... My motivation was already shit but now it is more like I do not care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just do not give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it is still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I do not feel the anger at myself as much. Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. it is Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I do not care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. that is literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I do not want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist. I do not want to kill myself, I just do not want to exist",0
"Even though i have a diagnosis, even though i know I am clearly not well mentally, i still feel invalid because I am not completely at rock bottom. I still smile, I still laugh, I still feel joy. Every damn time I laugh at some stupid joke or something, I immediately think ""why are you laughing? you are supposed to be depressed. you are a fraud, you are an attention seeker, you are a loser, you are a piece of shit"" I feel like I am faking my feelings and I feel really bad about it. i feel invalid because i still feel joy",0

"I am currently on Bupropion (150mg). 2 months ago things got really bad for me mental health wise and my doctor noted that and prescribed me a 2nd antidepressant, Paroxetine. I had exams coming up around 10-14 days later (from the date of the appointment) so I figured I would take the new medicine after it was over because it took me quite a while to get adjusted to Bupropion.However I did some research on the drug and saw it had a few side effects which made me worry alot. I have ADHD, and the side effects for Paroxetine were nervousness, forgetfulness, difficulty in concentration and I really do not want that to get heightened because I already have those (unmedicated for ADHD). It also had weight gain as a side effect and I had really bad body image issues &amp; disordered eating last year so I feel like I might spiral if I gain weight I do not intend to. How do I tell her I do not want to take the additional drug? Bupropion is working well for me and I made a few lifestyle changes which has made me feel a lot better this past month. I am in a much better place now and I do not feel like I need or want it. (I was experiencing suicidal thoughts when she prescribed Paroxetine)I am really scared because I do not want her to take it as an insult or as an act of defiance and drop me. I really like her. But I really do not want to risk these side effects and the potential withdrawal syndrome should I go off it. How do I tell her? Please help me. How do I tell my doctor I do not want to take an additional SSRI?",0

I am sick of it all!! sick of medication",0

"if I told my entire story, it would be too long so I apologize if things are confusing (also I apologize if some things seem or sound off, I dropped out when I was around 14 and I am nearly 18 now)I never had a good family life as we grew up in poverty making it worse with also having an abusive and neglectful mother and father.I have always been a loner with no friends and a drug problem that started when I was 13-14 because of my parents. I was being bullied for my looks or how awkward I was, which was just another reason for my downwards spiral. I used drugs heavily for a couple years of my life up untill I was 16. I still use them but just not as much anymore.I have a boyfriend of nearly three years now, but lately he is been ghosting me and other stuff, just not paying me any mind. he says he is been busy with school and such but I usually see him online on social medias and when he texts me, it is usually for things he needs like gas money.he says he loves me, but does not show it or sometimes, he will say he never meant anything. I am way too emotionally attached to him to break up which is a bad thing that I am trying my best to work on. I have tried to commit suicide countless times but they have all failed. I just do not know what to do with my life anymore. I tried going back to school but because of my poor social skills I just dropped out again. I cannot even get a job, and it is my fault. there is nothing left for me anymore, I am honestly contemplating suicide. I give up",0
"On my lowest points when the despair really hits me I often start writing my suicide note in my head. It has saved me countless times because I do not have anyone except for my mother and at the end Id always realize how disappointed and hurt she would be if I was gone so Id postpone going through with it. Basically, this is how I cope its pretty fucked up but it is what it is I guess. I was wondering if you guys think its better to leave a note trying to explain why you did it and maybe give your loved ones some closure or its just going to hurt them even more? Is it better to leave a note?",1
I have been suicidal on and off for 4 years and the only reason i have not gone through with it is because i feel too guilty about how devastated my mom would be. I have been shitty enough already. but lowkey its torture lol. i thought i was getting better but i keep pushing away everyone and at this point i know i deserve to be treated like shit and have no right to get upset or angry. I am sick of feeling and living . again. it happens over and over and over it never ends but i cannot do anything to stop it. idek why I am posting in here i have not left my house in like 4 days and have cut off everyone except my roommate the only thing that is been keeping me alive is guilt,1
"I keep telling myself tomorrow Ill get the gun. I live in one of the most lax gun law states (can walk in the store and leave with a gun in under an hour) but I am just too fucking unmotivated. I do not know shit about guns, I am worried Ill get too small of a caliber. cannot exactly ask the salesperson what the best handgun for killing yourself is. I know shotguns are best but I do not want to blow my face off for my parents sake. I really do not want to die but my chronic pain is killing my soul. No doctor has been able to help me. I just need the physical pain to end. I am 25 and living the life of an invalid. Why am I too lazy to go buy the gun",1
I do not get it I really do not. Today was actually the first nice day I have had in so long and I still feel bad inside. My head does not shut up and honestly I do not know if I am going to stick around much longer. Is there any way I can make the pain stop/reduced? I do not want to hurt my family and friends by dying but I do not have another choice. My head does not shut up,1
"because when i reached out to them in panic since Friday expressing it they did not do nothing. They never did, even when I was their client, ever contact my emergency contact. I really do not think they believe I am ever in pain, or have any trauma... That they will not believe me unless I am dead. I think my last therapist really does want me to die",1
"I have a lot of friends (also really good friends who would probably be there for me), I have a intact family, I received good education, etc., but nothing prepared me for life. I really fucking hate living (was not always like that). I am 19 now and I just do not want to keep on living, basically everyday I wish I was never born, often I think that is stupid because there are good aspects too, but most of the time I am simply sad, exhausted (from Monday - Friday I wake up at 7:00am and start trading, because being rich would help me keep on living). I just want to be successful, work for myself and be independent and I am REALLY trying. But if I do not manage to have 1m in my bank acc at the age of 25 I will kill myself or join the Foreign Legion and wait to be shot in combat. I am what Americans would call popular, but I still simply do not want to keep going it so fucking hard and I just do not want to live the life everyone is living (working 9-5, etc). Just wanted to share because I simply cannot (I could talk to my friends and family but my brain will not let me) talk about what is been on my mind for quite a while now Feeling Lost",1
Been relaying on optional sedative pills for battling anxiety.Right now I finally felt peace. I have not felt actually relaxed for a long time. I am proud of myself for staying alive during rough moments. First time in five months I do not have the urge to take sedative,0
"Hi everyone,I am a 28 year old trans man and my biggest mistake was coming out to friends and family about a year ago. I confused my friends, who are somewhat supportive, and I completely alienated my family, who are very religious and will not speak to me about this topic since I came out. Lately I feel like I have just become a burden to everyone around me. Even my supportive friends are just humoring me by calling me by my preferred name and pronouns. Ill never look like a man, sound like a man, or otherwise pass as a man. Even though I started taking testosterone, nothing has changed. Well, that is not true. I no longer can cry. But I wish sometimes that I had just kept my gender identity to myself and suffered in silence rather than because so much suffering to the people around me. I have been thinking about dying the last couple of days. I want to hang myself, but I am so heavy I do not think there is any place in my apartment that I would be able to suspend myself from. I do not know. Is it ever going to get better? How to undo all the harm I have caused?",1
Been depressed for too long. Like 10-11 years. All meds make it worse and I am on awful med withdrawal rn. I will never have any relationship in my life because depression kills my brain and any interesting part of me. Ill probably die a virgin too. I am so bored of EVERYTHING I seriously want to be gone. Why cannot euthanasia be legal. Its not fair for me to live like this. Life is constant suffering. I am too scared of death to do it and I have failed suicide but damn I want to be gone Really just want to die,0
there are many bad moments in my life. one of these days I plan to kill myself. Hello,1
"I (M20) had to end things with my girlfriend (F20) of 1 year. She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control, and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her, even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year, now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much, and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said ""I love you"" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together, I would really feel like I would lose her forever, the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do. I cannot move on from my ex and it is killing me inside",1
"I am out of options. Death is the best thing for me. Please do not try to sugarcoat it or convince me otherwise; its up to me to decide. Thing is, I am nowhere near as concerned about what will happen to me as I am about what will happen to my loved ones. My parents will be scarred for the rest of their lives, my siblings will be left without their brother, and my friends will never see me again. I love these people to death, but unfortunately, that love is not enough to make me want to stay in this living hell. I wish I did not have to hurt anyone to set myself free. I with I could make them forget I ever existed. If it was just me, I could easily end it all. But I cannot bring myself to hurt anyone else that badly.I wish someone would help me. Why is it so unrelenting?",0
"I can keep my hygiene up and cook and clean the apartment and spend time with the people I love. But if what I am doing does not make mw money, its worthless. Capitalism won, I give up. I am just a pawn, an asset. Count every penny I make every day so I am sure I can keep eating. And if I am not making enough then what is the point of breathing?? All I am is a worker. If I am not working I am not worth anything.",1
"I could not find any other reddit communities about suicide so I just decided to send here, you can delete if you want How do I prepare myself and my environment for my suicide?",1
"that is it. I feel stuck. Nothing of value is lost if I die. But what happens after death? Can I finally be free of pain? Can I roam the earth again? What if I do not die? What if I am sent to another timeline where I survive because you cannot die? How am I experiencing life right now, what the fuck is going on?In best case scenario, I am a ghost. Even if I still feel emotional pain, I am free from people directly hurting me. And can heal. Life is so beautiful and yet I am stuck dealing with toxic people taking their pain out on me since my existence. Hell, apparently my biological father broke my mom's ribs while I was in her stomach and that is why I have Moebius Syndrome, the best science-based guess on why anyways. What irony. The only thing keeping me alive is the uncertainty of death itself.",1
My brain is so foggy and its hitting me that my life is ultimately meaningless. Nothing matters if you think about it. Were all going to die sooner or later. I cannot imagine living with this feeling much longer. I do not know how I am still alive. Nothing really matters,0
"I do not want to do this anymore I feel like I should end it. Everything sucks. Jobs is wage slavery, family does not care, no friends, no relationship. No joy anymore from doing things I really want to end it",0
"I am not really sure what to say honestly. I have seen and dealt with a lot of horrible things, and many of those situations are permanently imbedded into my memory. Whether it be job related, or I am my own personal life. My support system is shakey at best, non existent most days. I cannot talk about my experiences from not being able too really trust anyone, and just feeling like no one cares. I keep pushing myself forward day by day hoping it gets better, but I lose more and more of myself each day. I am not sure what to say.",0
"I do not have depression I just have a bunch of external problems. I wish a car would hit me so everything would just be gone. I started a new relationship with this amazing girl who I have lot in common with by the stress of this new thing school, And other drama make me wish I had the balls to jump off a roof. My mom attempted suicide in front of me back in February and I have been burning the anger and sadness. I drink a lot and I have been smoking weed a lot more than before. Maybe Ill grow a pair and overdose on my dads pills or something. I worry about becoming a addict but I get closer and closer everyday. I even think like an addict lmao. This is just a bunch of rambling because I am pretty drunk and I do not open up when I am sober. I hope you are all having a pleasant evening :) I wish I would get hit by a car",0
 I hate being me,1
"I have everything the average person wants. Friends, Supportive family (except for the the fact that I am in a lesbian relationship), a girlfriend, decent education and a job. I am average in looks and doing okay in school. But I still feel like absolute horseshit. There has not been a day since my 13th that I did not want to off myself and even if there was, nice moments did not stay for long. I feel like I am in no way in the position to feel like this about my life. Like I am being ungrateful for all I have. Thinking this does not make me feel more motivated to live, I just feel more guilty. I just think that someone else would have deserved this life more.idefk if someone will actually see this but whatever Puzzling",1
"I went to a therapist in november, I have been taking them from that time, but the therapy is about to end. My psychiatrist told me that I can lessen the daily amount slowly then leave it. The first days was horrible, the bad thoughts came back in my head, you worth nothing, you should hang yourself, nobody loves you, I started to hate people again and got annoyed by every little shitty thing. I recognized that even my body language changed back, I did not look in peoples eyes while talking, I curved my back, I started to scratch my arms etc. I am not sure that an 8 month cognitive therapy can change the last 10-15 years patterns built up in me. Is it possible that I have to take antidepressants for a life?",0
"I cannot hold a job down longer than a month until my head starts really cracking down on my ass and I snap and cannot get out of bed until I get a phone call saying I am fired.I cannot go outside ever since I had a severe panic attack, literally thought I was going to die, that is extremely fun. So I am unable to go outside with chest pains and anxiety majority of the time.I cannot even interact with other people, that is even worse since all I can do is talk to myself, my GF and my mother. I cut off most of my family.It does not even matter at this point, I am fucking 20 years old who cannot just work how everybody else does and function that way. I am not sure if my childhood trauma would play a part in this or not. I do not even have a therapist either, I am not one for taking medication. I cannot work, I cannot go outside and I cannot interact with other people.",0
So just got out of my appt with Psyc. New job starting in August and wanted to get ahead of some anxiety and depressive symptoms that have been returning unpleasantly. He upped my sertraline from 100 to 150mg and added Wellbutrin 150mg to cover our bases. He did say that when I am stable we will work on coming off of things which is nice to hear. Anybody with experience in these two together? Symptoms returning and a med increase,0
"I am depressed but I do not want to kill myself. I am just depressed. I do not complain about it. Sometimes I feel good. Sometimes I feel bad. I get really bad manic depression sometimes but my face ALWAYS gets commented on. ""Cheer up"" ""you look lile you are about to cry"" even though I am not... I could be feeling great that day and somebody will make a comment. I have been hearing it constantly at work, by new people I have met. Like I are not happy but I am not trying to be Unhappy and I wish It did not annoy other people! But today really got to me, never had this in my entire life. Foreign guy to my country walks past me and starts laughing and fake crying while making a crying gesture... only me and him as I am walking past him. At first I am thinking he must be on a phone call... no way some guy is this loopy and could be so cocky...I could of seriously hurt this guy. I wanted to throw everything away and seriously hurt this guy. What the fuck is wrong with people or is it just me Another man walked past me today...I was very close to doing something stupid.",0
I told him to stop taking advantage of me so now hes constantly harassing me and sending comments on my YouTube channel. Its embarrassing because hes 15 and I am 19. I am supposed to have grown a spine by now. Someone is sending me awful comments on my YouTube channel ; (,1
"First and foremost please save the dramatics because I have already made my mind up and my decision is final. Please know there is nothing you can or could do.I am jealous of people in mental wealth wards. that is where I want to be. But I do not think I would qualify, as I am not outwardly a danger to myself or others. I have been through the healthcare system multiple times, and it only ever made me worse. I am on 100mg of sertraline and all it is done is made me more anxious and I cannot even enjoy music anymore. I cannot cry anymore, I cannot laugh anymore, I cannot cum anymore (TMI I know). I am convinced at this point there is nothing I can do to ever make things better. Not to sound like the joker lmao but society is fucked. I hate it. People are evil. Capitalism is evil. I do not want any part in this, and I would rather spend the rest of my life in isolation.I have attempted to end things twice before but failed. Once due to cowardice, and the second due to luck. I got better for a while, or at least I thought I did, but after COVID things have just completely collapsed and I am worse than I ever have been. I cannot deal with my brain constantly. I have no idea how I am supposed to navigate my way through this hellscape of a world with a brain that constantly makes things 10x more difficult. I am 21 years old, I am so anxious I cannot leave the house, unemployed, just dropped out of university, I have literally no friends, and all the friends I have had in the past I have ended up pushing away. I have nasty intrusive thoughts all the time, too awful to even say out loud. I am not comfortable in my own skin. I have no idea what I am doing with my life. I have tried so hard to do good and be good but I have realised the problem is not me, it is the world. The world is fucked and I do not want to be in it.So, I have a plan for tonight. I have got 20 packs of Aspirin and I am going to swallow as many as I can. I will wash it down with vodka. I am going to put my favourite album on and turn the volume up all the way. My parents will be out at the pub drinking and watching the football. I have never cared for football so it is not surprising to them that I am staying home. They will not be out all night though, and will probably return at 10 or 10:30pm. So, the way I see it, either they come home too late and I am already dead OR they come home, call an ambulance and I miraculously survive. At least then they will probably take me seriously and throw me in a ward where I belong.And yeah I am posting this for attention. Do I want pity? Yeah, probably. Just say you love me and tell me not to do it and feel sorry for me and all that. It will not do anything but at least it might give me a little bit of serotonin before I take the gamble.If you are suicidal yourself reading this, stop lurking this sub. Get help. Reading stuff on here is not going to make you feel any better, it is an echochamber of suicidal ideations. Get off of here for your own good. Well, I think this is it.",1
"I guess I am thinking more financially, like will mortgage payment protection/life insurance go up? what is the repercussions of a failed attempt?",1
"I hate when I get like this. I have an amazing life. I just get sad and think about all the sad shit I have been through. I have always found sadness as being week and looked down on people who commit suicide as being selfish.... until one day about 10 years ago I though about killing my self.. I had no plan and no intention, but my brain just kept bringing it up.. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder shortly after. I had/have a lot of survivors guilt after getting out of the Marines. As much as I want to stop being sad my brain says nope, be a little bitch for a few weeks. I have done my best over the years dealing with this.. As a Marine, EMT, and Police Officer I have seen a few things I would have rather not. I just spent my days off hiking with my kids, watching movies with my wife, riding my motorcycle, playing guitar, and working out. All of those things usually help but not this time. I hate taking medication but as soon as I stop it starts again. Why? I do not want anyone to know what is going on inside and I just have to get away and be sad in my car. Just need to vent. I hate this feeling. I could win the lottery and be loved my family but for some reason, inside I am just sad. Thanks for listening, hope this passes soon. Why am I sad?",0
"I held a cocked .410 shotgun to my head, I was scared of the pain. So I un cocked it and unloaded it. Last night. I almost took my own life.",1
"all i know is that depression is my lifestyle, i cannot complain anymore , no one will remember me when i will die , so ... fuck it, i will live my life the way i want it , doing what ever the fuck i want to do ,probably it might make me feel okay , because i cannot remember how being happy feels like anymore, fuck happiness, we can act like it , if you like something do it as depressed person , paint like a depressed person , write like a depressed person , make art like a depressed person , we were always complaining hoping for help from normal people , we are help, you can do it , you can survive, we can survive.\#ACT LIKE IT PROBABLY we can be happy in our sadness [ STOP grieving , act like it ]",1
"No more tears to she would or superficial bullshit to worry about, just a memory to everyone else, and hopefully a quickly forgotten one. That sounds lovely. The idea of not waking up tomorrow and this being the end of my consciousness brings me so much peace",1
I feel paralyzed. I have been in two places the past week: at my desk and in my bed. I cannot bring myself to do anything useful. I have not showered in days. I have not been outside in days. I cannot even bring myself to the kitchen for food. My husband keeps asking if I need anything. He cannot give me a new brain. All I do is sit and sleep and browse reddit for hours on end. What is the point of my existence if I am not capable of functioning? In a rut,0
"I am done.Yesterday morning, kind of out of nowhere, I set a date for my suicide. If nothing changes, then I am going to drown myself on October 14. that is ninety days from tomorrow.I work with my ex, and I am kind of terrified to go to work again. I have work tonight. In fact, I have three nights in a row. My family do not know that I am struggling, and they do not know about her, so I cannot explain taking time off. I am having really bad urges to self-harm.I want to break a bone, so I cannot work for a long time. Just to give myself a break. there is a hammer downstairs.I am just at a loss for words. I set a date.",1
"I cannot do it, everything hurts so much. My dad has told me to kill myself while he was angry before. And my mom ignores anything emotional and will ignore me if i feel bad. When i told them i wanted to kill myself a month ago they screamed at me. I do not feel comfortable telling my friends. I do not want to die, but my dad makes my life so awful. I feel like I cannot wait it out until i have enough money to leave him. I think i just want som1 to tell me to keep going. pls help",1
"Tw: idk which ones to put but I feel like I should mention that there might be triggers in here.I have dealt with suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember. In fact it was one of the only things I could remember- being so young and always thinking I wish I was never born. I did not sign up for this life. When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy. I have been going through my spiritual journey and along with that, for me, was realizing how toxic my parents are in the present but I always felt like I was just making things up. Overreacting. Making a big deal out of nothing.I have basically been begging my sister (7 years older than me) to tell me what happened for a while and finally, this weekend we talked. Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything ""wrong"" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something. They also know I could destroy their lives too. I feel numb.So now I am waiting. I am waiting on my sister, maybe my brother too, before I confront them. I cannot wait to confront them. I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us. I am their greatest threat and it feels fucking good to know that they are scared of me and what I can do. They do not think I have what it takes but when the time comes, it will be a glorious judgement day. I just found out my childhood was way worse than I thought",0
Being awake is so hard for me :( How do you break a 10 year habit of sleeping 3 hours a day?,0
"Every day for the past month I have basically just been trying to run out the clock. I scroll on my phone all day to get the thoughts out of my head because I do not want to kill myself and I am trying to just let myself live long enough until one day I feel better. But how long is that even going to take? I am just wasting my life distracting myself when I really should have just killed myself years ago. I do not even deserve to be on this planet, I do not contribute to anything. lm boring, I am dumb, I hurt the people around me. Can someone just give me a reason to hold on? Its so tiring to have to keep finding new ways to convince myself to keep going every five minutes. I do not want to die but I am so sick of waiting for things to get better",1
"During the day, I always feel so anxious to the point that I just stay in my room and do not leave my house. But at night, I get huge waves of sadness and hopelessness. Sometimes, when I am trying to fall asleep, the anxiety comes back. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I want a diagnosis so baldy for treatment and validation, but I am so scared. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed depression and anxiety",0
"Once in a while, I go on Instagram/Snapchat. I see a bunch of my (irl) friends re-posting things like ""this user is depressed"" and a ton of other depression/mental illness related posts on their public stories. Some of them post monthly ""mood reports"". The happiness level is always very low, and the anxiety level is up there. I really try not to, but a part of me thinks they are faking it. Though I obviously should not jump to conclusions so fast. there is also a part of me that believes them, and I cannot help but envy them for their confidence. How can they post things like that for everyone to see, when I give it my all to hide how I am feeling every day? I can just imagine the other viewers replying to their stories like ""Are you doing alright? I am here to talk."" and frankly, that makes me so envious and and longing for someone, anyone other than strangers on this app to talk to. It makes me sick to my stomach and I hate it, because I know I am being extremely selfish when I think about the way I am probably suffering just as much as they are, but they have support and I do not. I do not have anyone to lean on. I have not told a single person since the day I started feeling this way. I wish I could just muster up the courage to tell a family member or a friend. But the thought alone makes me sick to my stomach. So for now (and probably until the day I die), I will have to fight depression alone. My friends are so confident in sharing their depression",0
"I tried spending time with people but it just went back to the same annoying bullshit that everyone always talks about. School, job, relationship, none of which I have. it is rough having to constantly listen to people who have their lives together. I hate it and I am starting to hate them for it. Why cannot the universe do me asolid and just put me out of my misery. I am going to have to deal again tomorrow and the day aafter. I would not be surprised if I was dead before that night ends. Might do it while they are their to make a point that I will be dead less than 100 feet away yet nobody will notice. Maybe Maybe they would get it, but honestly why even bother not like I would actually get any catharsis out of it. How am I supposed to have friends if all i feel ever is jealous.",1
"Idk how close I came to concluding this clusterfuck life today, but I had a few drinks and uh, I am feeling q whole lot better you all.

"What can we say about the "" Unresponsive""? Do they leave us in the dirt because they have no answers? Do they leave us in the dirt because they are not capable of grasping what we are experiencing? Or are we turning their life upside down because we CHOOSE to explain to them what we are experiencing? Ghosting is the easiest thing to do when you want to avoid responsibility. So, what does that say about our counterparts.. the one's we vent to and supposedly trust but leave us in the dust.. What does that say about them.. they would rather experience ignorance than the truth. Our example leaves them render-less to what life is actually all about. it is easier to live your normal pathetic slave ridden life than it is to recognize that someone you care about is suffering and there is nothing they can do about it.. and that is why they ghost us.. not because they do not care.. but because they are inadequate, they are not the one's to solve our problems, we are. The sooner we take responsibility for our depression and loneliness; and even suicidal ideation, who can we trust but ourselves? How many times are you going to have to get hurt until you realize it""s just you, you experiencing it all. All outside conversation is speculation. THE UNRESPONSIVE",0
"This has been the worst year of my life and it feels like it just keeps getting harder. I have never felt so alone. I have never felt so hopeess. Most days it is a struggle to get up and feed myself. It really is just one thing after the other, and they are not little things. My husband cheated. he is been lying to me about our finances for years. We lost our home, we are separated, I have not seen him or my dogs in months. My cat died while I was away and I never got to say goodbye. Now my mom's kidneys are shutting down and I cannot get to see her and my husband is not even there for me emotionally. And pathetically I still love him and just want to be able to lean on him right now but I fucking cannot. I am so fucking tired. I keep praying for a break and it just does not come. I honestly just want to give up but I cannot bring myself too so I just wish I would die in my sleep. I am so tired. I feel like I am drowning",0
"Okay, I do not normally post my problems on the internet... but I am desperate for help at this point. I will keep it really cut and dry (this is years and years of shit, condensed) But I really want to know if I am being too ridiculous or not, because my family seems to think so...&amp;#x200B;If a family friend who lived in your house, with your family, raped you (virgin with a chronic pain disorder), would you ""expect"" your family to defend you? &amp;#x200B;Mine gaslit me and refused to believe me until it was found out years later he gave me vaginal scarring and HPV warts inside of my vaginal canal. I had to show them the proof from the doctor. He works at our family business, and lives on our property still. I have since moved out of town. But I cannot be anywhere near my family or even talk on the phone with them without hearing his name or his voice or the like. &amp;#x200B;I let my father (who runs the business) know that I was working on my case with a detective, so find a replacement truck driver because once he gets interrogated he is getting kicked off the property and fired. That was almost 8 months ago. Two months ago, he was given a polygraph and completely and utterly failed it. he is telling everyone at work that I am a liar and he passed the polygraph with flying colors. My brother is STILL best friends with him and plays video games with him 4+ hours a night almost daily. He works with him. My father refuses to evict him or fire him until he finds a replacement, which has not been working out very well. &amp;#x200B;I have been gaslit my whole life by my family, and have really bad C-PTSD that adds to my chronic pain. My rapist knows/sees this stuff daily, and I guess he decided to join in because he knew my family would not believe me or defend me... but now I am getting REALLY fucked up because I never thought it would go this far. I never thought they would spend years defending my rapist, I never thought that even after PROVING what he did, my family al would allow him to slander me at our family property and business. The PTSD and despair is so intense lately that I cannot pull myself out of it. I get an hour of therapy per week but it is not enough. I have been really screwed up the last several years, but after seeing my family treat me this way... after seeing my own sibling side with my rapist... after he gets to just keep going on like nothing happened.... after he gets to lie and tell everyone he passed his polygraph... after he gets to keep being apart of the family... after my family tries to make me feel guilty for having needs or feelings... I cannot take it anymore. I just cannot. &amp;#x200B;Is it ridiculous of me to expect him to be given a 30-day notice of eviction from our property? Is it evil of me to ask that he be fired so I do not have to hear his name or voice over the phone anymore? Is it fucked of me to feel extremely betrayed that my brother sides with my rapist? (my brother already treated me like shit but I never expected him to do something quite this screwed up. he is been shown proof that I was raped, so it is not just him believing my rapist, he CHOOSES to ignore the proof)... Is it wrong to expect a ""family friend"" that is ""basically a 2nd son"" to my father, to get removed from our family? Is 7+ months long enough time to ""prepare"" to replace him? Am I asking too much? I feel I literally CANNOT move on or continue breathing if I have to have him involved in my life in any way, shape, or form. My only choice has been to stop speaking to my family members. But that does not stop me from suffocating in the toxicity from afar while my family just sits idly by letting him slander me to everyone around them. It does not help me move on. It does not fix anything. I am just secluding myself more and more. I have never asked for anything this selfish in my life, so I feel INSANELY guilty for even asking for it... but I would rather DIE than to keep enduring this, and having this make my chronic pain even worse. I just need him out. I need him gone. &amp;#x200B;I will not even go into even more fucked up details, but he also stalks women around town, and is still a sexual predator, and might possibly have an attraction to children as well given his odd behavior. Unfortunately I cannot go after him for my rape because I did not get a rape kit done (because I knew my family would refuse to drive me at the time, cannot drive myself with my condition. I was terrified and knew the gaslighting would trigger me to kill myself in a heartbeat with how fragile I was). But here I am, years later, still stuck in this crossroads. And now it is even worse. I just want the pain to fucking end. This is way too hard to endure alone as a handi-cap person.&amp;#x200B; Do my feelings seem justified, or am I being ridiculous? I have to ask because my entire life I have been convinced my feelings are always wrong, and I do not think ""normally"" as other people do. So I would like to ask the Reddit community---What do you think a ""normal"" reaction to this situation would be? If something like this was happening to you, what would you do? I really need some other thoughts/perspectives...",1

"Hi everyone - maybe you can help me with my dilemma here?Had a major depressive bout in 2016. Threw the kitchen sink at it before eventually being convinced by a therapist that I should try medication. Things got worse. Then they got better.In 2017 the incident that triggered the depression came around again, and before I could get too low I went straight back on, and stayed on for another year. I have been med free since late 2018.The depression triggering incident has reared its head once again. Clearly I am not over it and have work to do. That said, my current regimen to stave off the black dog is thus:No alcohol, zero sugar, regular exercise, daily meditation, daily cold water therapy, lowering caffeine intake, CBT, and as ever reading a ton on the subject.Right now I am nearly as low as I have ever been: frequent crying fits, anxiety attacks, self harm, those thoughts etc.I discussed the idea of using SSRIs in moderate doses with my SO, and she flat out said that she disapproves of the idea. She says it changes me, and that she thinks I should keep trying everything else that I am doing. I guess I am here as a cry for help - am I letting down my partner by seeking medicinal help? Partner disapproving of meds.",0

"So I am 20 years old and I havnt been in a good mental place for a long time. I spend as much time as I can alone just because going out with friends and seeing them happy just makes me mad that I cannot be like that no matter what I try. For the longest time I have experienced a whole bunch of sexual problems (ie. cannot get it up, have never came from any type of sex, and have no sex drive at all). Recently I have started to realize that I think the root of my unhappyness has something to do with this. My testosterone is pretty low for a guy my age but not low enough to where I could go on any therapy for it.I just sort of wanted to ask any guys (or girls) if they have the same issues? Like I feel like if I could do something about not being able to have sex I would be so much happier all around. Root of problems",0

I will not abandon myself to be swallowed up and consumed by other people's plans for me. I am in control of myself and I choose my path.

"I have been feeling pretty weird and detached. My boyfriend and I just got through a series of arguments, we both apologized to each other but I still have a hard time being close with him because of my own internal issues. it is hard for me to feel close to anyone right now. Stressful events always send me into a dissociated state it just depends how hard. Recently, on top of this, I was physically assaulted by a drunk guy. did not even know it was coming, I think that was the most jarring part about it. He was another resident of the house I am currently living at and pretty much harrassed me passive aggressively from the moment I moved in. My weight has dropped so low because my appetite is gone from stress. I am approaching under a hundred, its very bad but I just cannot make myself eat. I have such an intense sense of dread that it makes me feel like I am going to die soon. Not even suicidal, just that I am at the end of my life if that makes sense. I get weird panic attacks where I am inconsolable one second, and then I pop back pretty much normal the next. Chores overwhelm me much faster, I have to fight myself to stay out of bed and even then I can only accomplish half of what I wanted to do. I feel very isolated and alone.Hopefully this will all pass soon, I am already so tired. Vent dump",0

"Last year, I had the worst day of my life. March 15, 2020, I was across the country in my dream grad program. I was two days into a semester and my colleagues from all around the country and I were all enamored with each others brilliance. Id never felt so connected to another group of people. Two days and four hours into the semester, the sudden spike of covid-19 deaths caused my school to shut down and send us all home. For the past year, I have been separated from my flock, and last week we were reunited at last. This week has been everything I dreamed of for the past year, and my vaccinated friends and I are soaking in each others presence. Today, the bomb dropped again. Due to the increase in the delta variant, we are being sent home again. I had a ptsd flashback to the first time we were sent home and could not get ahold of myself. Every time I am here, it is far too brief, and it is even more painful to say goodbye this time. I was to graduate next week, and my classmates and I will likely never see each other again. Now I am suddenly going home to no job, because that too is once again suspended due to the delta variant. Because of the unvaccinated people in my country, I am forced to lose out on the only thing that gave my life any meaning anymore, and I am being forced to relive the most traumatic day of my life. Its hard to see the point anymore, and I am thinking of ending it all when I get home. I cannot do this again",1

"I got fired from my job of 5 years in November. It was rather sudden and unexpected. In March I got a job but the hours were not what I wanted and my anxiety was through the roof. I quit before my training ended. Beginning of June I got real sad and decided to apply to a bunch of places got 2 no's. Got a call back for one but I was out of town and unable to make the interview. On our way home I got a call from another place to go in for an interview. That one I was able to make. It was group interview a little nerve raking but I thought I did well. They did too. Two days later they called for a second interview. I went into that one and did well, so well I was offered a higher position than what I was expecting and at full-time which I was also not expecting. Of course I said yes. But now I am not sure if I am ready after all. I started yesterday and it went well. But I am scared I will not like it or that I will let them down and not end up being who they thought I was when they hired me. Or that if I do not like it I will be letting my wife down. What if I made a mistake? My Dr today said we still need to work on my ""what if"" thinking and that maybe I have some imposter syndrome going on. How do you calm your anxiety? I start getting sad for my old job and old friends. And then I think about how much I miss my grandma. I just do not know what to do. I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings. New Job Anxiety",0
"Hello reddit, i am a 16 year old boy and i have came to the conclusion that i am not smart, and the worst part about it is that throughout my life i have had all kinds of people telling me that i am smart. My parents, siblings, friends, parents friends etc. Everyone seems to think that i am smart. but i have almost all my life been a very observant person and so i came up to the conclusion that my mental ability does not stand out from people in my life at all. school mostly bore me and so my grades are pretty mediocre, i have an iq of 110 which is not bad but is not either what people would consider a smart person. but yet, people seem to talk about me as if i were some genius. and i know this post may seem like bragging, its really not. the problem here is that i do not live up to the expections people have of me, i am living in a false bubble of being smart when I am not. and whenever people refer to me as intelligent it feels like a punch straight to my gut as i deep down know I am not. this situation may seem like a small problem, and i know that some people have it far worse than me. but i cannot stop thinking of myself as a pathetic human being that always have fed into this lies of being smart. and its not helping either that all i want is to be intellegent. all i want with my life is to make a difference for other people. but looking at people who have taken the world to where it is now they all share one thing, and that is superior intelligence. the thing i lack and the thing i hate about me the most. i do not know what to do, this whole thing really has taken a hit on my mental and i do not know how to accept it and move on with life. every day seems to be another day marching towards my inevitable death knowing that i do not have what it takes to be remembered by people. in a couple hundred years i will problably be forgotten as some ordinary dude. which is not the type of person i want to be remembered as.

"I (27f) have worked so hard the past 10 years to build a life that would make me happy. I was at my lowest point and suicidal when I was 17. I have pushed so hard since then and took therapy really seriously. I took my medication religiously and never gave up on it. I had a few bumps along the way, but I always got up and worked hard to try to make a life for myself. Because that is what everyone said would help. No matter how much I cried at night or how much it hurt to get up in the mornings, I kept doing it because I thought that someday, *any day now*, that it would all click and that heavy feeling in my heart would go away.But here I am. A month away from my 28th birthday and I just want to give up. I am so fucking tired. I work 2 jobs and I never get a break. I live with my partner and my mother and I spend a lot of time taking care of them and the house. If something goes wrong, I take care of it. But no one takes care of me. that is my job too.Nothing I do matters. All of this is pointless. Everything hurts *all the fucking time* and no amount of crying and begging or medication or therapy has been able to make that go away. I want this to be over so bad. I cannot kill myself. It would completely ruin my mother and partner. I cannot check into a hospital for medical treatment. I will lose my jobs. And if I lose my jobs, I lose my healthcare which means I cannot pay for my medications and therapy anymore.So what is left? Doing this same bullshit over and over everyday until the end? Going to sleep every night praying to a make-believe god to please please please not let me wake up in the morning?Sorry you all. I am just really tired.

Remember there is money to be made in the middle because it is towards infinity and beyond - the only freedom you have is the internet and that is it BUHAHAHAHAHAHA BUHAHAHAHAHAHHAScience or religion both are evil because then you associate yourself to some shitty social groups so then the establishment can run a story on you on how deeply flawed you are and how perfect they are either by killing you quickly or slowly eventually changing your gender so that they can turn you gay and rape the shit out of you until there is nothing left.do not come to Australia - it is auschwitz - the minute you are free, you are the product that will be raped to shits until there is nothing left so the sick perverts can jack off with their sick twisted fantasies and continue to feed it and then they turn to religion to justify their acts because it is based on a belief system.

"I had a plan. I had a day. I had written my letters. But then my cat fell asleep on my chest and I did not have the heart to move him and I fell asleep too.That was back in December. I started reaching out to friends and was feeling like maybe I would be ok. And then in January my best friend started dating a close friend of ours. Which would have been ok, but my best friend had been pushing me away for the past few months, and this was the straw that broke the camels back. I panicked about no longer having support and it pushed him further away. I was so fucking sad. And I must have leaned on him too hard for support. He was going through his own stuff, but had always promised I was ok to talk to him about stuff. Until it was not, but at that point it was too late. I would already ruined everything. He said I was not considering his feelings. Which fucking hurts because this entire time I was so scared of being a burden that all I cared about were his feelings. I put myself last more times than I can count to make sure he was happy, and in the end I am the one that was inconsiderate. And his girlfriend put more effort into our relationship which was nice. But now she is ignoring my attempts to reach out too.

And I am so tired of climbing. And I do not know what needs to happen to get to the top. I do not want to lose my best friend, or his girlfriend. I love them both dearly and I am so hurt by their actions. I know they are in love and love happens but it is so shitty that our friendship went to shit as a result. And if I cut them off I am so scared of spiraling. that is my best friend. I just wish they would try. Or at least my best friend. Just so I did not feel like our entire friendship was just a convenience while he was single. Because now? I am just replaceable. And holy shit if there was something that has ever made me feel like a burden it is this. Depression fucking turns me into a replaceable friend. Because why would anyone spend time with me when literally anyone else is available. Anyway. Thanks for reading if you even got this far. I just need a place to vent.

My chest and head feels like its going to explode. I went to the hospital earlier this week but did not get admitted to inpatient. I am scared to try to get help again because I am afraid of it failing. Ill feel more hopeless than I do now. I feel like there is no redeeming myself. I want to get better and I want to change but its hard when no one can be there with you along the way. I have no one to talk to.

"I am thinking about my last letters to everybody. There are very clear reasons for my mental state (abusive mother, therapist who does not care), some less clear contributors (relatives and friends who do not care) and of course the innocents (children, nice people with own issues).I wish to tell these people who made the decision not to care, but still I am afraid that in the end, mother and therapist blame me or others, and the innocents are left to wonder what they did wrong. I sort of do not want to be a dick to anyone, but I also do not want people to use this to their own ignorance.

After the age of 30 I think you should be old enough to make the decision to be euthanized if you wanted it. I did not choose to be born so I should at least be able to choose the terms of my death.

Why cannot we get the option to receive a painless suicide?,0
Life really does suck! it is just an endless battle of shit that constantly gets worse there is no real point in overcoming a problem because something bigger is waiting to destroy you around the next corner. I am 25 and my biggest regret is that I did not secured my noose correctly the first time. Thankfully I have grown from that experience and know would call my self a pro with a rope. I just cannot enjoy life anymore and it is like a bad movie or game instead of continuing the torment of sticking it out to see the plot unfold I would rather just turn it off and save myself the aggravation. Another pointless day to be alive,1

"I have been fighting for so long. It just feels like it is my time to sleep. I want to unpack my feelings here, but there is just too much. It would not even be coherent. I guess I can throw a couple out: My mom might be dying, just sits in bed screaming sometimes. Yet another human that I trusted with my vulnerabilities betrayed me. Four years that we were super close, then we get in a stupid disagreement and they say some things and I try to explain how much that hurt and take responsibility as well, but they just turn it all in their favor. they have also been talking about it to the rest of the friend group which they know better then me. So I basically just lost most all of my friends.My other close friend, not associated with the above rant, moved away recently and started ghosting me. Found out he is not talking to everyone cuz he is depressed too. I got molested in the 2nd or 3rd grade, still have never told anyone about it. Have then at gatherings every year or so.I fucked up things in high school, working software support now. Used to be an alcoholic in four years ago, so my memory is totalled. I just feel shit. I am just meant to be alone. No matter how I try it, people hate me or walk on me because I am too soft. I wish that I would just died four years ago. Why did I choose to keep suffering. I should have died drinking. Should have died from the fall. Should have died from the meds. Someone up there wants me to live and try, but fate keeps plunging me in darkness every time I see a light. I am over it (trigger warning?)",1
"Everyone wants to be special but nobody can be. we are all fucked, dragged in a giant rat race, a mess we made for ourselves, but everyone still wants to be better than the next person, their lives are special to them, even though we are just another dumb animal species, in just one planet, one single blue dot in the vastity of the universe. But I am special. I have got to be special. And everyone else does too. Nobody wants to be a nobody. Nobody wants to be a nobody",0
"I have let it all go. I am too depressed to get up and do things around the house. To even take care of myself for that matter. I am currently on so many medications that just do not work. Not to mention made me gain weight; the highest poundage I have ever been. I have never felt more disgusted about someone. There are people YOUNGER than me who already have achieved so much, including family members and friends and there is just no way to catch up. I have no job, no will, no energy. I am out of carrots to give and do not feel good enough to receive. I do not think I can live like this always grasping at straws and fumbling. I am too scared to feel any pain to die so what do I do. This damage I have done TO MYSELF is horrific and I am irreversibly broken. Time to go",0

Whenever a guy gets angry cos that is the only way we know how to vent, were called assholes or when I try and vent like a normal person I get called a drama queen. Especially when they get used to you never talking about your feelings, like when you do you can see them liking you less cos now they have to deal with your emotions(Most people)I hate how I see people talking about their issues and everyone is supporting and I get angry (internally) not that they do not deserve it but watching someone do something I crave so bad but cannot do, makes me so sad I just do not understand why",0
"(I am on mobile)I have everything planned to stop existing. When to do it, where I have to go, how to do it, how to say goodbye. it is been in my mind for years, even when I thought I was doing better, maybe I was just fooling myself. My previous medication was too weak, but my physiatrist changed it at the beginning of the year and the new one could be useful for my plan. I just need to find the moment. But I cannot stop feeling scared. I know my boyfriend will not forgive himself. My family will not stop crying. My cats will not stop looking for me. My friends will not stop feeling sad. I will f* up everyone is lives, I know that, I know I will damage everyone.But I am... Too tired. I am tired of crying everyday, of feeling useless, like a broken piece inside a putrid machine. I hate this world. Social media is filled with hate and despair, society is breaking under crisis and inhumanity. I cannot change anything, I cannot even change myself! I am still the same depressed useless thrash as 10 years ago! I just do not see reasons to exist anymore. Maybe after Summer will be a good time. I will give everyone good memories with me before disappearing. The letter I will write for them will ask them to not feel guilty. Hopefully I will be forgotten in a few months.

All day long manipulative advertising like a bludgeon over the head. If you tied someone to a chair to drive them mad make them docile and sit and watch a week of advertising and reruns and they would tell you anythingbetween that tv reality shows that just attract the most obnoxious irritants that they could possibly find and give them airtime And everything is unbelievably overhyped like it is now a political and social agenda whoop whoopwhen really the whole damn system is just a meat grinder and an extremely boring way to live majority of people on the other side have turned either a complete abnoxious blowhard or a bitchy aul cunt I do not know how anyone has that much energy just to be a total arse obnoxious cunt . watching this shit show on repeat and seeing some of the bizzare specimens that inhabit this earth is mildly depressing.

"Well guys, I need some help. Like I am seeing a licensed therapist, but thru talkspace as I cannot afford any therapy in my town...and I do not have a car due to anxiety. Well, this therapist is new to me, but before I came to her I was looking into short term disability. And before, I thought that maybe I could just tough it out. I am one to kind of push on through. I think that because of my flair for the dramatics, I do tend to downplay and gaslight the fuck out of myself when I am depressed. When I lost a job opportunity it got bad. I relapsed and started SH again. Which is something I do not like about myself. I was clean for about three months, but lately my job has been really hard on me. We started with 50 workers in my position, there are now 8 left....only 7 months later. I have even gone as far as nearly getting into an accident as a passenger, and being disappointed I came out unscathed. I wished something would happen. I do not enjoy weekends because I know I am going back. And the people I speak with are lovely, but I am incapable of thinking straight and you know when you are just getting BAD again. And I have no idea what I am supposed to do. My therapist said I would qualify, I have to talk to my pcp about it, but I feel so guilty. Everytime I get on the phone to talk to someone about it, I burst into tears. it is so humiliating to know they have got me crying for an hour recorded begging them to just ""Bear with me, I never do this. I am so sorry, I do not know why I am crying!"" I just need help. How did you get the STD approved? What should I expect? Please, please, no negativity. Taking a leave at 23, when I am otherwise in good health, is truthfully so humiliating and saddening. I feel bad enough. Claiming Short Term Disability for work. TW - SH, suicidal ideation",0

"I got heavily exposed to some really toxic mold about five years ago while working as a scuba instructor. There was a thin layer of it on the interior of my scuba regulator and I was breathing off of that regulator for about 4 hours a day for 2 months underwater and as a result of that my mental health totally collapsed in about 7 weeks flat Once I had figured out what was going on it was too late I had been severely poisoned I have been trying to get my mental health back ever since A couple of years ago I developed sudden onset severe debilitating tinnitus, with my hearing test coming back as normal. Every time I talk to a doctor about this one of two things happens and they either say that is impossible and kill the issue or they do not know how to help or who to refer me to and kill the issue I have done a lot of my own research and have had some success controlling symptoms with various supplements but I need back up on this and there just is none. I have tried bringing what I have done and the limited success that I have had to my health care providers attention on multiple occasions and they have nothing worthwhile to say Its always they do not know what to do and do not know who to refer me to and then the issue dies once again The research and the understanding just is not there yet for this kind of issue To date my health insurer refuses to acknowledge or entertain this issue. And insists all symptoms are mental health related only but also refuse to provide adequate testing to prove otherwise yes or no.I was recently able to push for a head MRI and it showed something interesting in that it showed/flagged for chronic paranasal sinus disease. This was interesting since previously my health insurer refused to authorize any test that would show such a condition and obviously what the MRI technician saw on the MRI was bad enough that it warranted calling the inflammation chronic with no other scan to compare it to. I do not have a clogged or stuffed nose. It is looking like I may have had/do have a phantom cyclical fungal infection in my sinuses for half a decade now that is causing my tinnitus and mental health problems. I asked my health insurer for a CT scan to see the extent of the problem and a biopsy culture to see what is causing the problem, both were immediately denied. I am currently fighting them on that. What is the point on giving someone an MRI if you plan on just ignoring the results?... If a CT scan and a biopsy culture shows a chronic fungal infection that is causing the inflammation, my tinnitus and my mental health problems might be treatable with the right combination of antifungals and steroids to treat the infection and bring down the inflammation. They are refusing to provide treatment by not providing the testing to see what treatment would help.I have been currently experience long term passive suicidal and or mutilation impulse on a near daily bases as a result of my current situation for seemingly no other reason. My health insurer is well aware of this and are celebrating since they finally provided a single individual therapy session and they feel that a single therapy session a month is adequate treatment for the situation that I am currently facing. I have been so destroyed by this situation that I am unemployed living with family and as result of making so little income last year I just switched over to state medi-cal insurance. Since I am now on state insurance my copays are zero and I am pretty sure that I can weaponize the current laws against my health insurer.These days I am passively suicidal on basically a daily basis but not actively suicidal. The current rules state that I am supposed to go to emergency if I am passively suicidal. I do not because I think that it is a waste of my time since there is no treatment there but I think that I might start going. Since, if I start showing up to my health insurers emergency with passive suicidal thought on a regular basis they are required by law to check me in and evaluate me every time but cannot hold me unless I pose an immediate threat to myself or others. This will bill the state a few thousand dollars each time this happens and will only be a time inconvenience to me At what point will the state stand up and take notice? Fifty thousand dollars of the tax payers money wasted, a hundred thousand, five hundred thousand? There has to be a threshold here where they start asking what the hell is going on here. I doubt they will blame the suicidal guy that is just trying not to die by suicide. Then I can leak the story to the media and let the story snowball from there. The negative publicity for health insurer may be very significant. Let me know what you think? I am thinking about weaponizing the current laws against my health insurer to get adequate testing and treatment Let me know what you think?",1

"Hello. First post ever on reddit(I think)Sorry in advance for this banter, but I do not feel like I can tell my friends about this nor do I want to post this where any fanily member can see. I am going to get straight to the point. I sometimes just want to die. Let me start by telling you abit about myself.I had a pretty though childhood growing up, my dad commited suicide when I was 5, and my mother remarried a man who was very abusive towards me and my siblings. She later divorced him when I was 17.I am nie 24 years old, never been in any serious relationships, not as lovers nor as friends. Still a virgin(not that it bother me much). I just want to make this clear, I am not exactly unatractive I think. I am pretty tall, strong jawline, pretty muscular and heavily tatted also I have a talent for music. But I do not feel like any of that matters. Call me narcissistic if you like, but it is the truth. The reason I say it does not matter is because it does not. Alot of people feel like if they look good they will be happy, but that is completely false, atleast in my case. The reason I want do die is because nothing I ever do makes me feel fullfilled. Once I pick something up I usually stick with it for a while and tend to develop a talent for it, but usually end up dropping it as I do not feel any fullfilment from it. I cannot develop any romantic interest for anyone, nor form any real connections. I just really want to day dream and live in my own world. The fantasy world I created feels like my sactuary. that is why I want to die sometimes. I do not know how or when but somewhere down the line I convinced myself that when I die I will live in the universe I created inside my head. I do not know why I have not killed myself yet. Maybe because friends and family will be sad, may have because my cat will be left alone(which is what I care the most about in this world). It feels like I am just waiting for a meaningful event that will bring joy to my life which will never happen. Any one else feel like this? Anyways, sorry for making you read this drunken useless banter. Have a nice day I sometimes want to die.",1
"Things are just stacked against some people from the start. I did not have a happy childhood, I was severely depressed and bullied hard through high school, college was a downward spiral.I am in my mid-20s with a low contact family and no real friendships. My only dating history was a year-long abusive nightmare. My job is so high-stress its causing physical illness. I have been so depressed for so long that I cannot even pretend to have interest in doing anything at all.Therapy helped early-on but its just stagnated, I have stayed alive but nothing has meaningfully changed. Medication is the same. Adding yet another to the cocktail brought me from being in constant pain to feeling absolutely nothing at all. I honestly think its worse. I want to kill myself just as badly, and I no longer have the constraint of being to exhausted to do so.And I mean really, what is the point? I drag myself through days/weeks/months of this until eventually I die? I have felt this way for 17 *years*. The best life has to offer is chucking pills down my throat to give me some false sense that life is not just immeasurable pain. there is nothing in my life to be happy or content about and I am just expected to numb myself into oblivion and pretend its better. I hate it. This is the best life can offer. What a joke",1

My husband has been dealing with depression for two years now. We have two small children together. He has been going to a therapist and taking medications.

I broke up with my ex but we remained best friends. She did not want me talking to other girls and I respected her wishes for 2 years. We hung out and did things as if we were a couple (big mistake but she wanted it). Out of no where she recently dropped me and then she told me it was because she started talking to a guy. She was my best friend and the only person I had that really cared about me. I know it hurts her as well. She had every reason to leave me and move on because I understand how bad I hurt her. I am just now realizing that I loved her so much and now she is gone. I am not sure how to move on or how to stop being depressed. Its been 2 months and its gotten better but somedays (like today) I just get super down. I have no motivation for anything. I keep telling myself that I needed this in order to realize what I was doing was wrong but what if I cannot find someone like her? She was perfect Heartbroken and confused.,0

"The last bad relapse I had was when I was 11, and I stayed in bed and did not eat/drink or go to the bathroom and cried and slept all day. For 3 days. Now 7 years later, I relapsed for a week and did not eat properly. I withdrew myself from my friends. The because of relapse? My mom overstepping my boundaries and worrying about her invading my privacy (like going through my diaries and journals. she is done it before so it could happen again). Both times I expressed/ attempted suicide I was screamed and shouted at for being selfish, inconsiderate and immature. I am simply tired of existing and no longer want to feel the pain I feel. Depression flared up again because of therapy and my therapist siding with my mom, who caused a lot of my issues, and not believing/ belittling me. ...And now it is been a good 5 days since I have eaten proper meals, interacted with my parents, or just functioned properly in general. I tried to choke myself 3 times this past week. I literally cannot come up with any other creative way to kill myself. I want help, but I do not want to go back to the hospital when I was the youngest one there. It felt like a fucking retirement home. My highschool counselor is away and I do not want to burden her. I hate my current therapist and want to look for someone else. I thought graduating highschool would make my life easier, but this year really turned for the worse for me. Anxiety attack for 3 whole months. On and off depressive episodes. Therapy is not working and mental health services are so slow and limited. Is there really hope for me when I am merely existing? It was not this bad before.",0
"So I am 20, male. Still at their place. Still in the house of the man who, on multiple occasions, had tried to choke me to death. Still in the house of the women who took his side when he tried doing what he had done, while talking shit behind his back about him. Still in the house of twofaced individuals who maintain the image of good, just, kind, outgoing people. Whenever I told my situation to anyone who knew anything about them, the response was the same - ""your mother loves you more than anything, your father is so funny, your depression is making all those things up, get a grip"". I do not even know if I am even remembering things correctly or if I am making things up. I have no proof of being beaten, of being yelled at, of being manipulated, of being persistently made fun of, I have none of that. Hell, the only reason I am working right now is because of my father. Of the same father who was only present in my life to berate me, to beat me, to try to kill me. Granted, I have failed a lot throughout my life, I did not study at all, I was at my PC all day, so I sort of do entertain the idea of me deserving all this. I did waste my life and academically, I did not do shit. I dropped out of college too and I feel like the only reason they have accepted this decision was because they just all gave up on me. My mother, father, sister, grandmother they just do not give a shit anymore and it makes me miss the yelling, the beating, the threats, because at least then, they had cared about me. And now my only plan is to move out. Not even to a different town, just a different place. But what about after that? I will still be a friendless loner with no life skills, with no life experiences, with no talents, with a minimum wage job, what then? I will still be alone, all by myself. Maybe I deserve that. I do not even know anymore. I am trying to be as objective as I can, but through my own perspective, I cannot. I am just so tired of being alone, of not fitting in. I am tired of knowing a fuck ton of people and telling all of them about how I should have killed myself and how I have no future, no ambition, nothing. I am tired of not having anyone to love, of not belonging to a group of people that will just do whatever the fuck. I am tired of my prime being wasted. I am tired of not having that wild life that I am supposed to have by now, because I have no one. I am tired of being the incompetent extrovert who can talk to people, but cannot be with people because I leave them all or vice versa. I just do not know what to do anymore. Daydreaming about doing the over the top proposal to the one is beyond pathetic given that reality will never happen. Daydreaming about making it big with music is beyond sad given that I do not have the talent nor do I know anything about mixing, mastering, processing and shit like that and my voice is pathetic. Daydreaming about being at peace with myself is beyond unreasonable given that I have been alone for so long that I feel like I have gone insane already. I am just lost, what am I supposed to do given that all the psychiatrists are scam artist scumfucks? Everything has gone down the shitter and even if I get out, nothing good will come out of it",0

I am just thinking abt all the tools i can use and I have come so close to trying.i feel kind of self-conscious?? like i know it is not this way but in my head this is problems for teenagers or like middle schoolers? i feel ""too old"" to be doing it for the first time if that makes any sensebut idk I am a lil scared i might start...anyways idk where I am really going with this...i guess I am just more so confused as to why i suddenly got this urge outta nowhere. first time self harm urges",0

"that is what I kept telling myself. I was backstabbed by everyone I knew. I was violently accused of shit I did not do. I cried myself to sleep every single night. I slept 4 hours every few days at the most. I tied that noose. I wanted to drive my car into a light pole. I forced myself to stop driving. I gained 30 pounds. I lost everything. I did not want to deal with it. 6 months later here I am. I was legally cleared of all allegations and accusations. I got on anti depressants. I started working out. Now I am at an all time high. I have never been more proud. For all of you who are struggling, keep fighting. It sucks. It fucking sucks so bad. But I am so fucking proud of you. So fucking proud. you are stronger than anyone I have ever known. You keep fucking fighting and you keep bringing yourself up. I hit rock bottom but I am slowly getting out of that hell hole, you can do it. just kill yourself. You are not worth shit. You have no friends. You have nothing. Just fucking end it all.",0

"TWHello reddit!For context, I am a 19 year old woman. I have been struggling with a host of mental problems since early childhood, including (diagnosed) bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety, and years of various eating disorders. When I was 17 years old, I was hospitalized following an attempt to take my life. I hated my time there, and managed to get myself let out after a week. I was better, a lot better for a while after that. I was better than I would ever been; I was regularly taking my meds, I was social, I was practicing my hobbies, I worked 40 hours a week and still felt excited to take on the world. It lasted for a good 2 months, until I had a bout of mania wherein I spent all of my money, abused a hell of a lot of substances, and basically destroyed my life from the inside out. By the end of it, I felt like a she will and fell into a deep depression. I have always experienced panic attacks, normally stemming from my PTSD, if I had to guess. As a child, I was abused in several ways and am now unable to be around people who are yelling without nearly bursting into tears. I also break down when there are sudden, loud noises. For example, a coworker was washing dishes the other week and I was behind her collecting a few items to stock (I work at a coffee shop.) She dropped a metal tray into the metal sink on accident, and it made a very loud crash; I was not expecting it, and my breath just left my body. I broke down in tears, and could not stop crying until my shift ended (about 3 hours later.) This sort of thing happens fairly often, and it just seems to be happening more and more as time goes on. Sometimes during these ""tantrums"", as I call them, I injure myself. Usually by hitting myself in the head with objects until I fall to the ground in tears, holding my head from the pain. Or I break things. Or I say incredibly harsh things to my family. It makes me feel so awful and guilty after the fact; I just have no regard for anyone it seems. Aside from the tantrums, which I have given up on trying to control, I also find it impossible these days to keep any positive thoughts. I cannot even be happy for others; I feel bitter and angry when hearing of others' successes. Which leads to more guilt. I am a bitter, terrible person and I just do not know how I can fix it at this point. I have all of these emotions that I cannot control, and everyday it just gets harder and harder. This whole post has turned into a jumbled mess I am sure, but I do not have the energy right now to proof read it. I am sorry. The further I go on, the older I feel, and the less control I seem to have over my life and emotions. I just feel like I have no footing and nowhere to go, and living with this mindset, I have no idea how long I can last. I do not want to die, I just cannot see myself going much further like this. Medication and years of therapy have done nothing. I am not really sure if I am posting this for advice or just to get my thoughts out there, but thank you to anyone who reads it. And I wish you the best. &lt;3 I am not sure how much longer I can go on like this.",0
how many people here actually own a gun? I have recently bought a gun and I do not think that is the most sane thing that I have ever done. I bought it with the intent to go to a gun range and to have a new hobby. the more I think of it the more that I see how easy it would be to put the barrel in my mouth and end it all. I have seen how several people have made it through a gunshot to the head and I do not think that is what I want to do at this point. I do not want to end up a vegetable in a nursing home and constantly being blown by a 300 pound black dude named Bubba and constantly having my mangina smashed. Maybe a 9mm hollow point? Own a gun?,1
"The note I wrote;If I die today I wish to apologise for who I have become, a person who revels in avoiding any feelings and seeks to bother when he knows no close connection will form, to avoid pain. I procrastinate on all aspects of my life though I make it appear as though I am hard working and I want to be friends with people when overall I just want to fade into nothingness.I do not know what made me like this whether it be how I always have been or through events transpired, though I choose to believe this is only through my conscious thoughts that I may have carried out actions that have hurt others and not due to external factors.To my family I do love you and hope you live on remembering how strong and beautiful you are, and how you all were there for me and forgiving me for my misdeeds time and time again. To people who considered me a friend I have surely hurt you many times emotionally, all I can ask is that you move on and find a better person than I to be friends with, as your all good people even if you do not think you are.And finally to whatever awaits me following my death whether it be gods, God and the devil, nothingness or purgatory, Just know that I am glad I got to gaze up at the stars because there is all of creation for those I part ways with to still explore.Sincerely(me) Today i found my old suicide note i made in 2019 even though life can still be pretty shitty I am still so thankful to the people who stopped me.

"I have a void in my life and no matter how hard I have tried to fill it, I constantly hit a wall. I am just so tired. So, so tired. I have tried hard to be positive and go by the mantra that it gets better. If I could see into a crystal ball and see for a fact Id have a great future, Id be fine. I cannot though and it makes me feel terrible. Life is just not enjoyable when I face the fact I do not have the things I truly want. I just do not see the point of life if I cannot be truly fulfilled. I just wish I could simply say Beam me up and that is it. Just send me back to where I came from. There is a constant void",1
"Its currently kind of killing me that I do not have any active irl friendships, and to some extent not even any very active online friendships. I currently also have nothing to do irl as its summer break (I am 16), so I literally spend my whole day watching YouTube or playing something, tho even playing games gets boring really fast if you do not have people to play with. I also do not have any kind of big goal in life I would want to work towards, as a matter of fact I am not even that interested in trying to find one either. How I have ended up with so few active friendships / none at all is a bit complicated so I am leaving it out here, but it was not that anything particularly bad came to be between anyone and me, its more that over time I just got less close with some of them. I also have tried finding new friends online, where I have found some different people, but still not like a group that I could spend time with regularly, and I have not yet made the effort to really try and get to know new people irl, and I am also not so motivated to do so bc; getting to know ppl irl hard. But yea, again, this is really not a nice place to be in, because literally the only people i talk to in days at this point are my parents occasionally, and then I text with some people and have perhaps like 2 calls but that is it. And with nothing else to do the whole day it is just pretty awful tbh. I just want to say btw, this is not me necessarily asking for friends here, I just wanted to vent. I need friends really bad",0

"Hello all,A little back story, I never been formerly diagnosed with depression. But the feeling has been going on for over 10 years. I would have months where I would like to stay home do nothing and just be in my room. Then I would have the burst of motivation to go do something then I would get the down time again. I always thought of ways of how I feel nothing. People would always ask about how I felt and I just feel nothing. I have my days where sometimes I lay in bed and just cry over what I feel like is nothing but always tell myself that I need to get my day going. I feel like I have no because in life. I always get the grunt of everything when it comes to my sibling and being the only sibling that can speak my parents language so naturally it falls onto my shoulders. I wake up to go work and home and that is it. Works been the only thing to get me out of the house and mind off it. I have always told myself I am not depressed or deserve ( I do not know how else to put it) to feel this way because I feel like its just normal everyday problems I am feeling. I have always been able to get myself out of the feeling but This time around, it has gotten pretty bad. I have thought of death a lot more recently. How I would die and how and what I could do to because it. At one point, I even got happy when I came to peace with death and was going to try it. that is when I realized I needed to get help. Besides therapy is there any coping strategies that you guys can offer? I was thinking of getting on the meds but need to get a referral from my GP. Getting the help",0
"Still live with my parents, still a minor yeah. Not for long though, wish I could cherish my youth for what its worth since I never really got to get out of the house much or have anything closely resembling a healthy functioning friendship. Just overcontrolling and overbearing parents with shit abusive colleagues. Parents left for a business trip, 'bout a week. Two days ago, was melding over my dwindling sanity and the increasing gaps in my memory. I cannot remember shit about any traumatic events I may or may not have had in the past, so it is quite depressing to think that maybe they just never happened in the first place. I have no real reason to be depressed so it is quite likely that I am just doing all of this for the attention. At least that is what I have been told. Cracked out alcohol, since I cannot cry. have not been able to cry for a very long while. Parents used to beat me for crying, colleagues used to beat me as well. School when I was younger was shit, used to get beaten up a lot. Broke my nose twice, a few other bones in my body. Belittled and broken down so fucking much it bled straight through to the point where I had a decent sized portion of my adolescence where I was obsessed with the idea of transitioning to abandon my entire previous personality and set of memories since I could not cope with them anymore. Still fucks me over to this day, and although I might have found a balance for a ""softer guy"" type personality it still does not play well at times. Right, sidetracking. Alcohol. Thought it might help me unbottle some emotion to the point where it overflowed and I might cry again. have not eaten anything proper for months now, usually just half a meal a day, (Think a sandwich, maybe two on a good day), so the alcohol kicked in really quickly. Sisters were going to be back so I counteracted with around 7-8 espressos in a large mug. Looking back that was probably a bad idea. I never got around to crying. Instead, sitting on bathroom tile for hours on end, I just took more and more aspirin with ibuprofen to get around to finally biting the dust. I have been trying for *years* now, it just never really worked out since the probability of a proper death and not just oh-great-i-fucking-survived-and-now-my-parents-are-going to-ship-me-to-a-monastary type lifestyle, but then I just could not give less of a fuck. Necked down 6-7 aspirin and 25 ibuprofen when a really bad habit kicked in. I tend to cut myself. Right around my thigh, so that it is easier to hide. Usually I just cut once twice, never revisiting the same wound but goddamn this time I was persistent. Cut the same area multiple times till I hit the femoral artery. Alcohol, ib, aspirin, and caffeine make for one hell of a whack combo, and then I was bleeding out to death as well. Over the course of the next few hours I proceeded to loose a lot of blood. Funny how the only time I am ever smart and live up to the expectations others have of me is when I am trying to kill myself. I have no idea how much, but I had a really fucking bad fever, tremors, and a few others but I have no idea what happened after I got in bed. Bled through the damn mattress, and the only thing that saved my life was a belt and some salt. Strapped it so tightly around my leg I have no idea why I stopped the bleeding, I do not remember 80% of the shit that happened two days ago, as usual, but the thing that was the scariest was the relentless sense of loneliness. it is why I am here now, two days later. Alone in a dark room, desperately calling every number in the contact book to see if someone will pick up, someone to save me from the same nightmare, but no one is there. I am all alone. I know I deserve it, but it is still scary. After all this time, years on end of loneliness I still cannot get over it. I would say I am a kid at heart but after the things I have done in the past the guilt just will not let go. All I know is that life is fucking scary, man. I apologize for the mega-condensed version of this. Yes this is on a new account, I do not want people in my personal life knowing what the fuck is going on. If I managed to do one thing right, it was hide this whole fucked incident from my sisters and brother-in-law without them guessing what the fuck was going on. I did not touch on some of the finer stuff but I suppose that is to be clarified later. I also know there is a decent chance this will get removed, to which I tell the moderators that it is pretty understandable. Whatever happens typing this out helped me a little at least. EDIT: Transferred this back to my main account (paranoia be screwed) since the new account bugged out. I am sorry for that\~ Depression, Amnesia, and Death oh my.",0

"TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss",0

"Ok soSomehow all the unhealthy junk food and excessive alcohol binging I have endured the last (almost) 25 years has not killed me so like, congrats I guess.MY BIRTHDAY IS JULY 19th!I have anxiety over birthdays, both out of being extremely nervous for numerous reasons but mostly because birthday songs are cheesy as fuck and I hope no one ever decides to torture me with a surprise birthday song because I *will* sweat. Alot. ANYWAYS my mom was nice enough to surprise me with a ticket to San Juan because I never leave my house and I think I freaked her out over my Covid-19 related loneliness isolation suicide jokes but I love dark humor.

(Judge me, please because like who does that other than me from now on). Secondly, (again I do not think I have ever heard someone say thirdly) I am a firm believer of doing work for money, so () here is a short poem out with random things I see around my room as the last word in each line for anyone who decides to chip me $1 or $5 or whatever the hell ya want honestly! My head hurts and my fire alarm is going off, so when I say short I mean very little effort and shorter than you expected so here because I do not want to burn alive 4 days before me day of birth if its a real fire:From the lamp on my leftTo the lamp on my right (I love Amazon lamps)I am afraid to flyAnd my bulbs do not light(One lamp does ok give me some cred)As I lay on my bedThe alarm goes offMy tv is too loudAnd I am holding in a cough(FIN)Ok awesome, love you all, drink a ton of water, remember to give me flying tips, lemongrass oil scents help anxiety, oil diffusers are cheap on Amazon so get one, stay safe, take care of yourselves ok!

"I thought depression was something that could go away again, but now I am starting to realize that it probably never gets better actually - the best you can hope for is a zombie-state-life on medication where you cannot feel any euphoria from movies, music etc. When you get older you just lose your ability to feel profound emotions from stuff? I am only 22, but i feel like i have already experienced this decline since i was 14-15 when i started to feel really depressed. it is been 7-8 years now, and the only thing that made life worth living for me was smoking weed and being high 24/7, which you can only do for so long. Now I am back to being sober because weed was driving me completely insane and was having panic attacks everyday, and i feel completely depressed every single day wanting to kill myself. I cannot even get on medications because i accidentally told my doctor about my former weed habit, so they want me to be 6 months sober before prescribing any medication.

"today has been too much for me to handle. I am going to vent a bit before getting into what I plan on doing for the rest of the evening.my heart's been aching for months, I do not talk about that much with people. I have learned and am still learning to expect much less than what I would like. the things I have wanted and maybe needed. . . I am in the process of convincing myself I do not. the things that used to hurt me cannot even hurt me anymore because I am just numb to it now, as I know it will just happen again eventually. people are not perfect, but I am just tired of the constant hurt, the conversations I feel like I am not always heard in, the apologies I have come to hate hearing each time. I do not want that anymore. I am a lot to handle as I have bpd, but I do not believe in the slightest that I am unlovable and that I am not deserving of the things I want out of this life- mostly love. I deserve that, and after an entire childhood receiving none of it from the people I was supposed to receive it from and a couple of failed, abusive relationships. . . no, I absolutely do deserve the love I want. I have been in pain for too long. all I have ever wanted was to share my life with someone and vice versa- make it *ours*. I do not want to be alone, but I am losing hope and I am getting too tired.I lit a candle I swore I would never light unless things finally felt good and okay- things are not good or okay, but it is all part of my plan for this evening. as I type this, I feel certain that suicide is just the way I will go. I do not go out much to be possibly killed on the street or something related. I never did order sn and do not think I will plan to. I am considering hanging myself now. tonight, I will enjoy this candle as much as I can, take a nice shower, take good care of myself, wear some really comfy clothes and listen to some really nice music. maybe I will even play a couple games. I will be here for myself the way I wish others were for me. tomorrow, I will do more cleaning and organizing of my belongings. I plan to throw absolutely everything away.if by the end of all of these things I still feel the way I do as I type this, maybe it is meant. I told my best friend tonight about these feelings and the person I very deeply care for and adore so much does not know what is even going on. I feel like I am too much for them and I do not want to make their seemingly good night a sad one with these feelings. honestly, I wish I did not feel this way. I wish I could recover and live this life out with them. sounds pretty pathetic, but what is even more is that I had hope for there being a chance of them having a tiny bit of love for me. mental prep.",1

"Yesterday was not a good day. I got back into town after my grandmother's funeral and on the ride home from the airport, my girlfriend broke up with me. She took the three days I was gone to move all of her stuff out, all while I was texting her and saying how excited I was to see her when I got back. It feels like my entire world is crashing down around me and there is nothing I can do about it. Every single abandonment issue I worked so hard on is cropping back up and I have nowhere to go from here. A week or so ago I commented on here, saying that I had not felt this low in years and man was I wrong. it is so much worse than before. Like it went from zero to Mach Jesus in a manner of minutes. It was not even this bad when I ended my marriage, but maybe that is because I had a support system. Which I do not have anymore. it is just me, alone in an apartment that I cannot afford on my own, with a cat that loved my girlfriend more than it loves me.I can feel myself spiraling back into the headspace I was in as a teenager, and wish I could say I cared, but I honestly do not. it is like reconnecting with an old friend. Usually, I can just pull the covers up over the sadness and forget about it but now I am ready to just crawl into bed with it and forget about everything. Just want to crawl into bed and stay there",0

If I ever complain about someone being annoying I get punched in the face. I hate my fucking life and the cunts that live in it. I am just sad",1
"The past couple of months have been a mess. I have gone through a break with the person I truly expected to spend the rest of my life with, my job has been unbelievably stressful, I live in a city 5 hours away from my townhome where all my friends and family are. I have very few friends here and the times I do go out, I am overcome with crazy social anxiety and do not want to talk to anyone. I also live alone and spend most nights by myself. I see a therapist weekly and immediately after my sessions I do feel better. But, it does not feel like I am making much progress and I am wasting my money. Recently I have been more reckless than normal ie. driving wayyy over the speed limit, zig zagging in and out of traffic, and blacking out more often than Id like to admit. Even though I am not suicidal, I wrote out a suicide note to address my friends and family just to see what I would say to them. I realized how little I had to say and felt really inconsequential. I am trying to take everything day by day, but I am fearful that it will get to the point where I cannot take this no more. I do not want to die, but I cannot seem to make my life more fulfilling and worthwhile. Its just starting to get to be too much. I just want to know if anyone has any advice or strategies to put themselves in better situations Looking for fulfillment in life",0

The exercise does not matter: yeah, I have more muscles, so what? how is that of use? I wish I cared more about my body, but I do not really. Meditating just leaves me with my bad thoughts for too long. Being grateful for minute things just reminds me that I have not achieved big things etc... The cycle continues and I feel powerless to climb up from the hole I dug myself. Nothing seems to help to get me out of this funk...",0

I do not go around publicizing it, even to dates. but when I date someone who talks about their depression at all, I am turned off. it is like their depression will get on me and make mine worse. I date people who I think I can tell are ""normal"" and the closest thing to depression they know is a break up they had once. Everything else in their lives are consistent and healthy.

My fiancee recently broke up with me in the mental institution after my recent suicide attempt. I feel so hurt and heartbroken. I feel like no one's going to love me for who I am.

Maybe some day Ill stop being afraid or lose the idea that this, at some point, should get better, atleast that is what everyone is saying. But i do not think it gets better.

"27yo Male, good life experiences including backpacking Vietnam, visited Paris and Barcelona, enjoyed cities like Nashville, Boston, Montreal, Scottsdale, moved to FL with my gf at 25 on a whim. Successful sales career making six figures since 21, averaged a new car every 9 months and currently own 5. On my second home owned which is valued at $500k. Working on opening my first business now. [I wanted to include this because I feel people that know me on the outside assume I would be extremely happy with my life and my successes, but if anything it is caused me more pain and loneliness and THINGS are not the answer to anyone's depression. Also do not assume the people that appear to be in good places, really are in their mind, we just bandaid our problems with stuff to hide our problems from ourselves]I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, as early as 3rd grade I can remember pitifully trying to strangle myself with a balloon string (sounds silly how unrealistic that was looking back). I have tried ecstacy a handful of times but never in conjunction with peaks of depression and anxiety. After almost 8 years in the car business which definitely worsened my depression/anxiety significantly, i left to explore myself and start my own business which really took a toll on myself. This worsened since I took myself off of buproprion and sertraline 5 months ago after losing my insurance. Recently my girlfriend and I decided to do some ecstacy with just us at home, it was extremely therapeutic in regard to my mental health. There are 100% health downsides I am sure to this, but for my extremely infrequent use I am not worried about the downsides. here is how it helped me.To describe my mental health state prior to, I felt very empty and constantly in fight or flight. I have very little enjoyment in anything and found myself breaking down and crying more often to a breaking point. Why was I breaking down and crying? Because I felt so guilty thinking how badly I wish I could just disappear and how unfair it was to tell my sister who just had her first child that I did not want to be there to watch him grow. Or to tell my girlfriend that i do not want to start our life and family together because I would rather be gone. To clarify, i do not want to hurt or kill myself. But i cried even harder because I also was so destroyed realizing that the only answer is to stay and feel so empty and useless for the sake of everyone else which meant a life of pain for me. There was no winning.When we did ecstacy it allowed me to feel again (assuming a Seratonin pump) and it allowed me to appreciate. I was able to hold my girlfriend and just feel joy, feel how much she meant to me and how much i enjoyed her presence. It allowed me to remember what made life worth living, what happiness was like. I was able to work through all those thoughts inside with a fresh palate and an open mind. I was able to address things with myself that i was afraid to address. Think ways that I have not been able to for a long time. I had a shit eating grin the entire time and just felt so alive again. The next day was even better because it was a much lesser baseline but just enough to get through the day with the ability to feel good. Eventually the euphoria went away but my mind was at ease. Just because the ""high"" stopped, i was still able to work through my thoughts with myself and affirm my reasoning for being around. Unlike other drugs, you will likely remember your experience from ecstacy and similar drugs so that you can take away your thoughts with you. All in all, if you are in a very stuck place and unable to crawl out, i honestly feel a controlled experience like this may be good to let you revisit your life from a new perspective again and reason your way out of your hole. I am curious to hear people's opinions on this, either for or against. Happy to answer questions as well. Anyone use Ecstacy while depressed? My experience.",0

"Tw:sexual assault/rapeToday my family brought up sexual assault/rape and talked about how its the womans fault. I sat there listening feeling so hurt. I remembered that they said the same things to me when they found out I was raped. They called me a slut and a whore. They told me it was my fault. It was only a year ago when this happened. Sitting there listening to them today made me angry, it made me wonder why they did not care even when it happened to their own daughter. I have never opened up about being raped but now I am because I am pissed. The cops never cared, my family never cared, my friends at that time never cared. I had to deal with it on my own. Everyday I have to deal with it. No one ever made sure I was okay. No one ever got mad at the grown man who raped me. I was 15. 15 and no one ever cared. I have never in my life felt more suicidal than at that time. I still just want to die. More than anything I want to die. I am sorry Ill probably delete this. I just wanted to say something.

"Basically I am stuck.To give you the rundown, my home situation is bad. I am 13 (hopefully that does not make people belittle me, I just want to be as clear as possible.) My mother is single (parents divorced when I was born) and she treats me like actual shit. I have had to be my own caretaker for a long time, she is never really been there for me emotionally and sometimes even physically.I have wanted to off myself for awhile, actually. I guess I am just worried about the after part. And it is not like I *want* to feel pain on my way out.Maybe I just do not want a surefire way of ending it because I wanted someone close to me to just.. realize how miserable I am. I kind of want to do it just as a jab at my mother. ""This is your fault."" that is what she would think. Or rather, it is what I would want her to think.It baffles me that I have been able to fly under the radar so long. it is probably selfish to think this way, but I have been living like this for so long and if things do not change I will have to take initiative.Only one person actually cares, and he is someone I know that is online. he is kept me clinging on but I feel bad relying on him all the time. My mother has done nothing to help. I have seen three therapists and she just uses that as ammo against me. My father knows but at my request he did not do anything (I am terrified of being institutionalized and I know that is what my mother would immediately do. I do not think he knows quite what to do himself.)I have ruined myself. I am not sure what to do. With the approach of school, I think about doing it more. But I still have not even devised a plan or anything. I do not know what to do. I feel like the longer I sit in this rut, the better of an idea it seems.

"We cannot compare the amount of pain that we experience. Everybody faces hardships and struggles to make it day by day. We have different views and opinions and some people that are so hated are likely misunderstood. The light of Jesus is where we go to seek help and have a feeling of comfort. We are to love each other and have a minimum of a mutual understanding of each other. This is what I grew up to believe and I realize that it is a lie. People try to make it a competition and it does not matter what values you uphold or how pure your heart is. People want to see destruction and observe it like a movie while they snack on their popcorn. If you do not have even a nickel in your pocket, you are not worth a second of thought. But if you have even five dollars in your pocket, people will craft a new mask to put on their face in order to get close to you to reach into that back pocket of yours to take what little you have and insert a knife into your back. Not everybody has something wrong going in their life but rather had too much good in their life to understand how true human emotions work. They can go and stomp on your heart, shove all their riches and mental stability in your face, and make you grovel in pain until your will to live is thinner than a spider's web. People will fight to show you that they are right and that everything should revolve around their mindset and make us into mindless symbiotes to be bent and manipulated under their will. that is why we have politicians bending the truth and blinding us from the truth that we can no longer see under the pile of garbage they piled onto the world and presidents and rulers who make decisions that affect millions and make the big shot calls that could devastate many. Religion is the one thing in history that has lead to conflict and disputes on the origins of life and what awaits us after we die. We cannot comprehend everything in the world - let alone the ever-expanding universe. So why create a truth? Simply to just make us feel better with death and blot out the fear of the unknown. People are absolutely disgusting, violent, manipulative creatures who think they are superior to each other and find it necessary to better themselves through the destruction and torture of others. To all of that, I raise my middle finger to and hope the day comes when complete extinction of the human race comes upon us. Our Hearts Are Made of Glass and Minds of Clay",0
"I am sorry in advance for this negative pretentious drivel. This just really needed to come out of me. |||Distrust, disappointment and futile attempts to escape hackdom is all life seems to be.||| 29 years old. I make money as a commercial music producer - music for ads, tv and sometimes amateur film. I am really starting to hate my job. I feel like I am lying to myself when I do it. My family are somewhat encouraging but I know they think I am a fuck up. I spend every bit of time (when I am not trying to calm down my anxiety or pull myself out of depression and when I do not need to crawl out of bouts of procrastination) on music \- playing it, recording it, composing it, listening to it, reading about it. I have always wanted to be able to live off of my own art - but I have always told myself since the beginning (13) that this is a dreamers pursuit and to be realistic - to see what life is really like - and to know that this obsession will lead to nothing but suffering, alienation and potentially a whole lot of humiliation...but.... to do it anyway - because in the meaninglessness of life you should try to at least make it all about what you love. As I get older the idea of getting somewhere... and by somewhere I do not mean for fame or fortune.... but to make something people care about, to do something important in a way of giving back to culture - giving back to the arts that have not only saved my life numerous times, but made me feel exhilaration and love like nothing else has.... this idea of getting somewhere feels less and less likely. The most depressing part is that I do not think I have even properly put myself out there yet, that I would not really know how to --- That I move in so many different directions artistically, that I am so indecisive with what I want that it kind of seems impossible.... AND that this feeling of age is looming on the horizon. Like I am crossing over to 30, with my chances of any of this happening slipping away.Drugs and alcohol have now officially become about coping for me. it is not a party anymore. I hate socialising most of the time, I do not have social problems I am just really tired of it - especially when it is not music related - so I act up, get sarcastic and facetious and use the booze and amphetamines as a way around being irritated by everything and everyone. Which I feel guilty about... ...Because I know this is clearly just me being a miserable, selfish asshole. I cannot stand the incessant opinions of others - I never react to what is being said, I can even ignore it at the time but when I hear some of the shit that comes out of peoples mouths there is always a pain in me that starts and becomes more and more intense over a few hours. It turns into resentment, hate and then crushing sadness. The arrogance, meanness and the seemingly endless conjecture I keep hearing from everyone around me is excruciatingly distressing. I socialise less and less because of this. I live with a few older men - who all at one point tried to do what I want to do. It has not worked out. Now all they seem to have is marijuana, welfare cheques and a cynicism that is so dry, dull and invasive that just by proximity It can make you feel overwhelmingly despondent, dehydrated, hateful and high. there is a bitterness in them that you can feel through the walls of the house. Avoiding conversation is imperative if you want to maintain sanity with these types. Speaking with angry contrarians has never been helpful for mental wellbeing. At least not for me anyway. I have been through 3 long term relationships that all ended badly. The last one was particularly bad. I blame my apathy. Right now I am sort of in a casual relationship with someone who I suspect sees me as an ignorant pig. there is a lot of criticism about a lot of different things thrown in my face by her. Any conversation I bring up about commitment or what the relationship itself is meant to be is dodged. I am really starting to feel like I cannot trust this person. That they see me as disposable. I have already uncovered a few lies by them. Maybe I am wasting my time with a lot of people in my life. Maybe they are wasting their time with me. Every once in a while when I drink I think about killing myself. Every once in a while when I am sober I do as well. Some months way more frequently than others. Some days in those months it is for hours at a time. A few months back, I grabbed some stainless steel scissors and started cutting into my forearm. No one found out what the scars really came from. I had a bad excuse. I am still not sure if it was Just to feel something or to express my frustration in some way. Maybe it was for attention. Cutting myself for attention makes me feel an incredible amount of shame to just think about. But like I say I am not exactly sure why. I do not know where this is going, but I feel like I needed to put this down somewhere.. I have tried a shrink, I have tried family and friends. It seems to only be met with fear. I am sorry again.

"I have been obsessed with the same girl for almost 20 years and everyone else I like, I instantly fall in love with. I cannot act on anything because I think I am worthless.Not like any of these feelings are real, they are just my brain trying to extract love and positive feelings from someplace since I do not get it from anywhere else. I wish I was dead I am too full of love",0
I am so sad. Its my birthday tomorrow and my husband and I are fighting and I am so sad. Hes so mean. Hes mean then he tells me its my fault and gaslights tf out of me and plays victim. I am so sad. I want to kill myself on my birthday. I want a gun for my birthday so I can kill myself,1
I am 24. No career.No proper degree. Bad college grades due to constant mental health issues with no support.Was preparing for an exam hard. Finally gaining motivation. GF broke up abruptly just a month before exam. Affected me badly. Failed in the exam. No money to retake it. No one to talk to. It looks like an endgame to me.I cannot escape this. No escape.,0
How do I get over the fact that I will never experience love in any capacity? Is it my fault for being sad that people do not love me or am I genuinely just that undeserving of life and love how do I get over this,0
"When I was around four, my brothers kicked me off a bunk bed. I do not remember if it was intentional or accidental, but it does not matter now. I fell from around 7-10 feet up and landed flat on my stomach. Had to get stitches in my chin. My whole life, I have been told I have ADHD, autism, etc. but just recently it occurred to me. The incident aforementioned is most likely the root of all my behavioral problems.All of my memory loss issues, uncontrollable emotions, and all of my problems with society in general. I probably have half the brain processing power of the average person. You can imagine how that affected my academic performance.I will never be able to follow my dreams. Its like I am stuck in a she will of my true self. The passion is there, but the motivation and critical thinking skills just are not. I have been suicidal my whole life for not fitting in, there has always been a screw loose that just puts people off. As a result, I have no friends. I think back on my life and I wonder what it could have been. What it would have been had I not had the tragic incident destroying any hope for my future. My future looks grim.I do not even want to die, in fact, I am quite terrified of dying. I just want a solution to what feels like eternal suffering. I just want the pain of my existence to end. I do not want to live a life if it means I have to spend one more minute in my broken mind. I know there is no cure for TBI. What can I do at this point to cope with my situation? Early Childhood TBI Has Ruined My Life. (20M)",1
"Today I am done. I really am done. I will be honest, I am a teenager, I probably have it easier than a lot of you here. Maybe I will not be forever alone. But I need to rant, I need to get it out or it really is going to kill me. I am 16 right now, yeah pretty young I guess. Back when I was 14, I dated this one girl, puppy dog love, but it was fun while it lasted. Then I hooked up with another when I was 15, that is the extent of my experience.I have friends, they are a good bunch to be honest, but I feel alienated from them. All of them have had a 'glow up'?. What I am trying to say is that all of them have got something good going in life. Some are hooking up, some are dating, you get the idea. But I am static, I do not feel anything has changed for me. I am still the same height, arguably the same face and I feel like a fucking loser. I am average at academics, a little bit athletic; I train karate and boxing.Well today I met my friends. All of them, our friend group involves my ex-girlfriend if you can call her that. Well they all sort of broke of into groups, taking pictures, videos and whatnot. I was the only one left out. Me and my friend had planned to drop off my ex-girlfriend back to her house. What I am going to say next sounds fucking hilarious; but I thought maybe there is a chance for something there. Well that went away as soon as she told some of my other friends that she is not really comfortable with me coming along. I have some self respect of course, did not push after that.I feel like this is the final straw. I have done everything, I workout; I am in pretty good shape and my body reflects that. I speak confidently enough, I wear good quality perfume. I have a good dressing sense. that is what people have told me at least. But it is not enough, I have not gotten anything after my two earlier experiences. I had quit smoking a year ago. I started again, I have had a run-in with drugs, and alcohol. have not let it mess up my life. Completely quit drugs and I drink once a month.Well I smoked again today, I am thinking of drinking again. Might dabble with some safer drugs. I cannot do this shit anymore. Oh I suppose I am a porn addict as well. I have tried to quit a bunch of times. But I always relapse harder. A lot of this may be my own fault, maybe I did something wrong. But it just feels as I have been assigned a certain role in life. A role of rough highs and lows, except there are no highs. My friends cannot really help me, they would not understand. These are supposed to be my ""fun"" years but they are not, I just want to die peacefully at times. I guess whatever I may do, I cannot beat genetics. Maybe my face puts people off, my lips are slightly larger than normal I guess. Probably my insecurity speaking.However, whatever I do and I think I have done everything, I cannot seem to climb the wall. I cannot seem to beat the system. I always feared being nothing in life, but now that I come to think of it. That may be my destiny. I think I will just slowly start destroying myself, I might get cancer or something but I will have some amount of fun while doing it. But that is about it, I want today to mark the day I give up. They say hard times make strong people, I am not one of them and so I suppose it is natural that I will be cut out of the gene pool. I just wanted to share this with you guys, I am still young but this feels like the end. I will end with something I have learnt from experience; you can always fall further, and the pain numbs you at a certain point.I hope some of you make it out, I know I will not. Also probably should add, depression sort of runs in my family, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt. I do not know what to do anymore",0
"I want to tell my story before I die. I have dealt with mental health issues my whole life. I have tried harder than anyone can expect or should need to. My earliest memories are of my father coming home drunk and high. Beating my mother. I would hide under the bed and play dolls with my sister. So she would not hear him beating her. I always wanted friends but never had any. I was the weird kid. I could not go into anyone's house unless invited. I remember peeing my pants outside the door because I was not invited in. I remember my father living 20 minutes down the road but never being there. Only holidays to look good in front of his parents. I remember my mother's family hating me. Telling me I would be just like him. How men are worthless. My stepfather beating me. How they would blame me and say I was lying. I remember being kicked out of the house while still in school for defending her when he raised a fist at her. Hitting him. Making him cry for his mom. I am not a good person I get it. I remember being homeless. I remember meeting my wife at my second job. Breaking into my grandparents house while they were gone for the winter. Drinking too much because I just wanted it to stop and the blackouts gave me peace. I remember the few years of happiness I had with my wife. Well as close to as someone like me can have. I remember us going to school and planning a future. I was going to be a chef. She wanted to be a writer. I remember the knock on my door. Hearing she was not ok. The hospital. Seeing her. Them telling me to call her family. Calling them. Not knowing what to say. She got a headache at work. She just started crying after sitting down and passed out they said. They sent her to a bigger better hospital. I remember driving there. I drove so fast. Reckless. They took her by helicopter. They did tests. I remember they told me she had an aneurysm. She was brain dead. Them asking me to sign papers to have her unplugged. To donate her organs. Her brother wanting her father to see her again. Her father that molested her. That molested more than her. Went to prison for it. I remember stalling so he could see her. I do not know if that was the right thing to do. I hated him. But she was his daughter. And for some reason it was important to her brother. I remember he was not supposed to touch her. I remember him touching her anyways. I remember breaking. I was already broken. I have been bipolar my whole life. I remember signing the papers to take her off life support. Not being able to be there when she passed. It was too much. I apologize. I was a kid. I could only handle so much. I was 23. I killed her with the stroke of a pen. You can say she was brain dead and already dead. But that was what ended it. I remember getting mail that told me about how her organs saved lives. Calling her family, even her father to them. I do not remember the next few years well. I drank a lot. I was trying to kill myself. I stayed with her family some and mine. I made unforgivable mistakes. I got angry. I came close to killing. I remember pulling a knife. I was going to commit suicide by cop. I remember the multiple times I tried to get help. I remember giving up. Going to a group home. Just hoping. I would get help. Trying so many medications. Counseling. Being left to rot. I spent near a decade there. I tried anything they offered. I failed me. They failed me as well. Never following through. Promising things that never happened. The group home was infested with bed bugs and cockroaches. Covered in bites always. My roommates all needed help that none of us got. I was jumped and had teeth broken out for being mistaken for one that was a sexual offender. After years of trying I had to leave as another was bringing weapons into the house. we would drink together. he would pull out one. Tell me if I did not kill him with it he would kill me then himself. I went to stay with my mom. I am having trouble typing more. I just need a break. I can finish later if anyone wants. My story or as much as I could write.",0
"Like, wow. I think of suicide everyday for the past year. Half that year was chronic suicidal thoughts. I am talking with a plan, what the aftermath of my death will be like, how others will react, etc.Recently I decided I wanted end my suffering. I went online and bought the drug (do not ask). It arrived. I have it in my hands, its easy access. All it takes is a little and I will not even know I am dead. Thinking to myself, wow its that easy, huh? And then I am dead, which makes my suffering no longer existent. Everything is fine now. But no, its much more hard than that. You have the permanent solution in the palm of your hands, all you have to do is take it, and your desire is MET. So much power is held in my hand right now that I can finally make this decision. It all came down to this moment. I came to realize I do not want to die, I just want to end my suffering. Looking at this drug in my hand gives me fear, anxiety, worry, so many different emotions that just looking at it makes me feel uneasy. What is it that I want best for me? I feel that I have no choice but to take this dark route as a only solution. It feels impulsive to have bought this. But why must it feel like this is a choice now? Why could have I of just for once, realized this is not the answer. But it does feel like one at the same time. Its all too conflicting. It gives me comfort knowing I have access to it, but when do I decide to take it? How do I prevent myself if I had enough of living? Have I really had enough? What is enough? I am not even working towards something, so why am I here? Just to suffer more because people tell me to stay? what is the answer, I am still deciding. Why does it have to be this way I do not know. Thinking of suicide and a plan is like a walk through a park. When presented with the permanent solution in the palm of your hands, it becomes the most difficult thing ever to commit to.",1
"Part of the time I feel okay, or even good but then the other part I feel like fucking shit. I am scared of almost everything. Some of the only things that did not give me anxiety now gives me anxiety and I hate it so much. I should not have to feel like this. I want to be normal, or I want to not exist. I do not want to die because I do not want to feel pain even for only a few seconds. I also do not want to hurt the people I love, especially the other people going through something. I need help. But I do not know how to ask for help. I do not want to live but I do not want to die.",1

Recently though things are just getting to be insane I do not know if I can blame it on my relationship if I can just blame it on life or what. I hate that I can have a shit week then have really good days the next and it does not do anything for counteracting the depression. Its like the only outlet I have known is music weed video games or girls. I feel like I have just exhausted all my resources to the full extent money, friends, family, health, time. Myself as a person has been so drained mentally my brain actually feels like silly putty. I do not know how to fix my life for the better. Every step I have made has led me down the wrong path eventually I am just getting really really tired of stepping and there is so much more to this but fuck I have no idea how to be a happy person or a energetic human being anymore.

And obviously, this drives people away. So am I supposed to just keep all this to myself?I have tried those hotlines, good Samaritan emails, they do not help... I always feel talked down to or like they do not actually care or I am holding them up and it just does not help.I am at the end of my rope and am thinking of numbing myself out with anti depressants and anti anxieties now to just be able to stay alive and not be a bother to anyone.

My old life and everything and almost everyone I loved is gone. Taken away. I do not know if I should hope for better or just die.

"I put this together while sobbing so hard I almost made myself vomit last night. I had a pounding headache, had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. I have never hd a girlfriend before and I am 25. The pain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself; I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.It reads.Dear K,I wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So, I have to let you be happy. That is what I want, because I love you so much.I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you.When I was young, I learned the word for always in French: *toujours.* It always sounded like a beautiful, graceful, yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy, sentimental, but genuine and strong.you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart.

"Its very hard for me to write this because I know I have people who love me and care about me. I am 27 years old now and have no clue what to do with my life, I work as a labourer but it is something I do not enjoy and spend between 60-70 hours a week doing it, I basically have no free time to do anything I enjoy. I often find myself frustrated that this is what my life has become. I would try and find something else but anything I apply for I never hear back from or not qualified for. When I was in high school I was very athletic, great social life and everyone thought highly of me. Now I am an embarrassment and I have gained almost 100 pounds. I gamble and eat/drink all of my money away and people think I am not good at anything. I basically feel like a walking joke, I have no idea how my life ended up this way. When I go to work and think of all of the things i would rather be doing it really hurts, my passions are slowly fading and I am turning into a zombie.

I have never had a ""stable"" life, even throughout my childhood. Abuse was always rampant, no matter where I went. From home to school it was always the same. Lost a lot of loved ones along the way, whether natural, suicide, or overdose. It was all the same. I am prone to survivors remorse, but only because I have tried 7 times unsuccessfully. I have been to numerous psychologists and psychiatrists for different treatment and different medicines but to no avail it seems.

"it is getting to this point now where answers are dangled in front of everyone is faces, but nobody cares. They look away, they try to justify not looking. it is not just in social issues (which I know I am not allowed to bring up here). it is also in communities. I made a post in a gaming community recently, and I was trying to figure out ways to go about one of the problems presented in the game, for those unaware, it is Genshin Impact, and the artifacts system. I proposed my solution, which is to craft them. Probably means nothing to many, but might to some. I would accept good rebuttals to it because I am neutral. I got none. In fact, I was the only person to make a good rebuttal, to all points. I provided an alternative to my solution. But the comments I got on prior posts just leave me baffled. it is not the first community to do this. I have been in others. I do not hold a bias towards anything. I just look at what creates the most good and the least/no harm. The more I am reminded of people's stupidity in general life, and not just the internet either, makes me feel more hopeless, on top of having a serious issue that for some reason is not taken seriously.

Whenever I feel like things are getting back on track I randomly get this feeling of everthing coming down and not being worth it anymore. Tonight I even kind of realised my dog is old and is going to be gone any day now. What do I do man. I went to some sessions with a shrink but it did not go anywhere. Maybe I did not tell he enough? I do not know. One of the few things keeping me on this side is that I am too lazy to write a suicide letter to everyone. Mayyyyyyybe the feeling of leaving my mom sad? But that I do not know. I thought few (maybe too many) times of slashing my wrists lenghtwise in the shower. (Quick sidenote as I am writing this I really do not want my dog to die man). I fear the day I am in enough despair I do not care about suicide letters or anything. What do I do? I do not wamna leave guys but there are times I do not see other options.

"I have been falling deeper and deeper into depression recently and now the only person that was keeping me above the water all this time is about to start dating someone and even though they are not together yet, I already feel like he replaced me with her.. I never talked about my issues with him (even tho he knows I have them) but he is aware of how much he means to me so it just hurts being abandoned like this by pretty much my only friend.. The worst thing is they have only been talking for like a week now (even though they have known eachother for about a year) and today when he got a new job offer, I found out about it by him showing me screenshots of the messages he sent her hours prior. I just do not have the strength to fight life anymore and I do not know what to look forward to..

I cannot afford the gym, or healthy food, or a nice quiet apartment, or my hobbies. So then I get depressed anyway.I am really scared. I am scared things will not get better. I am scared I will never be able to live a normal, comfortable life. I am scared I will never have the energy or money for my hobbies, or for my loved ones.

"Today was the first time I really thought about suicide. I have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like ""i wish I was not alive"" to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. But this was sort of a coping mechanism I think to deal with stress. I have been pretty successful in life, and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. In general i have been pretty driven and interested. I was clinically depressed about 15 years ago, but I have not had a similar episode since.However, today I felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. I did not just think ""I do not want to be alive"", I thought ""maybe I will not be soon"". I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other, ""oh I can do this"" feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before, and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day, and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any. July 28, 2021, maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons I cannot really understand.Thanks for listening Today was the first time i really thought about suicide",1
"Factors I should probably mention: \- I am a 16-year old girl (so I am probably just being overdramatic)\- I moved to a different country when I was 12 so that did not help my mental health lol \- I live in an abusive household &amp;#x200B;How I have felt since i can remember: \- empty (when I was in kindy/primary school I used to tell my mum that I felt as if something was missing but with no idea of what it was)\- lonely and out of place \- I am wayyy too emotional\- I need a person to be codependent on &amp;#x200B;How I have felt since I was 12: \- I wish I did not exist\- Very extreme mood swings (from depressed to euphoric, from angry/bowling my eyes out to laughing)\- Very very rarely, I hear sounds/voices and see bugs crawling on walls and my skin that are not there (I do not even think I should mention it because it is happened a handful of times and I am aware that it is not real after a couple of seconds)\--&gt; to give clarification, I do not fully see bugs or hear words; I see them for a few seconds through a veil/not directly where I am looking at. \- Insomnia (lucky me)\- I will go from fantasizing about kms for weeks or months to feeling pure euphoria... kind of like there is too much energy inside my body (ngl it is a pretty good high hahahah)\- So much guilt \- I honestly hate myself (look at me typing this long-ass post just to feel special smh)\- I am just so pathetic tbh \- When I feel that euphoria/energy, I feel invincible and I become even more impulsive than usual (popping a tab on a school night, cutting my hair, getting stick and pokes, piercing myself, changing my entire bedroom, spending too much money, deciding that I want to become a professional \*the amount of hobbies/projects I have started but never finished is the length on the Odyssey hahah\*, deciding I want to go to the beach and swim in the ocean fully clothed etc.)\- panic attacks (the worst one I had lasted over two hours, I kept going in and out of consciousness bc of the hyperventilation and had to call an ambulance)\- I feel like a sack of shit but at the same time I am so different and distant to everyone and feel ""special"" or ""gifted"" to an extent (I sound like such a narcissist sorry)&amp;#x200B;What I think is wrong with me? Nothing; I probably just have depression that is purely situational due to my family, but please please I need to hear what other people think about this. Life is pointless and the more I grow up, the more it feels like a simulation/test of some sort? It honestly makes no sense; it is just emptiness and loneliness. Thanks everyone for your time! &lt;3 What the fuck is wrong with me? Pls someone help me figure it out",0
"1) I am going through therapy and we are in the very first few appointments (since beginning of June) to the point where I am comfortable getting even mildly upset/angry/frustrated with her with basic questions like ""When do you think you started having problems identifying emotions?""2) I feel like I have this deadline over my head with marriage and children and happy family, and I do want a child but I do not want to bring them into my chaos and to be able to love them and nurture them fully because I did not get that3) My job sucks. I was in the ER recently with suicidal ideation just as a precaution like ""Well shit I better go before I do something dumb"", paper scrubs, paper plates, sitters who want to make conversation and you are just praying the psych gets to you before the dude who is throwing shit. And I told my psych what I do for a living and he is like ""I have heard, through the grapevine, that is not nursing. that is barely reaching what you could be. And from what I am hearing, you want to be a lot more.""4) Chronic absenteeism. Because I am depressed. Because I do not have the will to literally live and it is a coin flip if I want to help other people!!! And my thinking is ""Well, change your environment so you are more challenged and intellectually engaged because clearly that is not happening at your current job"" and then my boss hints she is not going to recommend me if I try and apply for patient care positions within our system... Which lands me in the hole for $10,000 for an unfulfilled sign on bonusSo yeah. I have got a roof over my head. My partner is barely hanging on and letting me stay in his house ""our house""I did go fishing by myself this past weekend, where I got all the things, I packed them into my car, I planned for partner and myself to go, but then he got sick so I just went by myself because there was no other time besides this past weekend. Oh yeah, my dad who is been estranged from me since I was 14 is coming up to visit on Friday for a full week. I am going through a lot of mental energy and I do not think I am realizing it",0
"Day was not really that bad. Spent it with a bunch of family, but sadly it reminded me how lonely I am later on. Started drinking and that brought the emotions. Would love to attach to someone, but do not want to guilt them into liking me. I guess I am just sad.... Had a shitty day",1
"I like to think that I have a pretty good life (cannot say I have ever truly suffered or struggled) which makes the fact that I want to kill my self that much worse. I do not even have a reason, yet it feels like that is the only thing I have ever truly wanted. If I want to kill myself now, what the fuck am I going to do when I have to face any actual hardship? I should be at a good point in my life. I just got my first part time job, I am going to be going to my dream college in a few months, but I still want to blow my fucking brains out. The only reason I can think of as to why I have not killed myself already is because I am afraid of what will happen if I fail. If I survive getting hit by a car or something and get seriously injured, not only am I going to fuck up my own life by throwing away my chance of going to college this year and the job I just got, but I am also going to be a huge burden on my parents who are planning to retire soon. If I had a sure fire way of killing myself I would do it in a heartbeat, but guns are out of the question since I have no way of getting one and there is not anywhere I could jump off that would be tall enough to kill me. The only thing I can think of would be getting ran over by a train, but some one would probably find me before the train comes.I just feel like I am supposed to kill myself. I mean, if I was not, then why would I want to kill myself for no reason for so long? Like if there was a god, his plan involves me blowing my fucking brains out. If I had a reason then there would be something I could do about it but since I do not I just kind of feel like killing myself is what I am meant to do. It also sucks that I am such a huge bitch about it too. I tried cutting to sort of work my way up to suicide but I could never cut that deep. I feel horrible for saying this but I knew someone who cut themselves so badly they had to go to the hospital and I fucking envy them. I wish I had the balls to do that but I have to psych myself up for half an hour before I make a tiny cut on my leg. The one thing I want is to kill myself and I cannot even do that right, which is kind of fucked up.I do not really know why I am posting this. I guess venting to strangers is better than worrying my friends and family for no reason. I feel bad for saying all this because I know there are so many people who have it infinitely worse than Ill ever have it who either do not want to die or have several good reasons for wanting to die, but I feel like I have lived the best life I could ever ask for and it still is not good enough for me. I am probably never going to get the balls to actually kill myself but I pray every day that I either kill myself or something else kills me. I feel like I am destined to kill myself",1
Whenever something bad happens I get suicidal thoughts.I cannot explain how I feel properly. It just happens in seconds like I can be in a good mood and all of a sudden out of nowhere the thought of suicide appears. It gets more intense if something bad happens. Is this normal? I do not have anybody to ask this. Is this normal?,1
"Not me. I say that is what makes life a piece of shit.The constant suffering and hardship on every front, and inside me every day, make life a train wreck that I did not sign up for.And I want out. Some people say they love life's challenges...",1
"I am soon to be 27. CD has left a big mark in my social life at this point. Not all of it comes down to my mental state and it is sympthoms of course, but most of it does.There is a matter that I would like some advice on, and I am afraid you will not read it if it is below a lot of text so I will ask it first. **Have you ever told a long time friend about your depression and how did it go? Could it be a good idea?** I am talking about long time friendship here, someone who did see me at my worst and still stayed a friend. I am afraid they will just see me as a burden. I mean, at this point, I am pretty sure they know, it shows from my behaviour. Then again, I feel like it would make things clearer between us. But then again, again, I am afraid it will just show me as sort of a weak link. Or worse, that it will just come as an excuse of all of my abnormal behaviour like not joining them for events, or leaving suddenly, refusing invitations for weeks etc...Now to the wall of text. I have tried to addsome jokes, and now I am afraid you will hate them.*It all went wrong when I was born* Or at about 15 years of age, at least that is as far as me and therapist got. Although it took me more than a decade to go to therapy, both me and family were sort of aware, to a degree. Although I did expect it to just be some trauma/anxiety due to one psycho ex, not a full blown clinical depression whose paranoia side she just enchanted with some actually justified fears. And the older I get, the more it shows. I could get by easily before, it was quirky to be absent minded, closed off and sometimes gloomy and social interactions and making friends or starting relationships took less effort when I was in high school. I did not exactly fit in, but I did not suffer a lot for it, so all was good. Over time, of course, when you ignore the signs, thing get worse. Lack of will to live, over sensitivity, panic attacks, darker and darker thoughts, all came by and did not leave ( unlike my exes ).Now, it takes more, and I feel like I do not have that ""more"". Turning down a wedding invitation because you dread the thought of large social gatherings is not quirky, it is a relationship ( friendly, not romantical ) ruining act. Also, I did not refuse the invite, I went there and hated myself during every moment of it like a man.Now due to my age, social interactions come with more expectations and consequences. And they obviously require some experience, or *people skills* which I just do not have. Small talk is pretty much impossible when you do not have the will to get out of bed, much less keep up with current events. Work also gets hard when any time someone does not approach me with a clear ""Hello"" leaves me thinking about why they hate me so much, and having so send two mails instead of one because I forgot to add the attachment leaves me in shambles, looking through job search engine, and being on my tiptoes for a week, despite the fact that my colleague lost us a cool 300K due to some copyright issues and nobody gave a fuck.I am a capable person. I know it. I have done things.Like, if boss wants me to work overtime during holidays, sort out an entire year worth of bills despite not being even remotely related to accounting and also deep clean all 7 offices we have around my town, I am their man. ( As long as they pay me, I am not a sucker ). But an invitation to a teambuilding event? Felt like shit, might quit on the spot and cry for weeks later,idk.Same goes for friendship. Just the two of us doing heroin and raping chicken in a satanic ritual in a private place? Sure. A party? No no no.*it is easy to fall in love with me, it is hard to love me every day*Those are lyrics to a song that resonated within me. I can be funny when I try. I can be charming. I even made a few self made jokes and quick quips which made people laugh that I hapily reminiscence about 5 years later. Also, while years of not giving a shit about my health annd constanly feeling like shit have left sizeable consequences to my body, I have a good looking face. As long as it is winter and I have 7 layers of clothing on me and a hat, I am hot. So, making those shallow relationships is easy. Going deeper is hard, which is also true for my sexual endeavours. And that sucks really. I know a lot of people have it harder, I am not trying to dunk on anyone with this, but knowing that up until a certain point I can be great, as a friend, as an employee, as a boyfriend, better than a lot people really, but there will be a line, whether it is something to be done, or say, or something will be brought up that will form that line, a line that I cannot cross has always shown up so far. And almost everyone crosses that line while I stay on the other side. That crushes me. I would like to chat about people in general, friendships and relationship. Your advice, observations and thougths are very desirable / needed.",0
"Hey uhm...my depressive disorder does not really like me and is kicking my ass. I broke up with my toxic ex finally. But all I can think of is ""I bet no one is proud of this. Afterall it is such a simple thing. I should not be proud. What if he was not *that* bad. Maybe I will never find better."" and it will not stop.&amp;#x200B;I am diagnosed with clinical depression so it acts up, and its been a lower amount of dopamine already nowadays but its gotten worse after this. Free but not from my mind",0
"I started therapy about two months ago. I have had two sessions since then. If you are wondering why I have had so few sessions, its because I am broke, also my therapist sometimes answers my mails too late so by the time she replies she is fully booked.I was able to schedule an appointment from the website where I found her in the first place, then she gave me her mail address so that is what I used to book my previous appointment. But she always answered too late, and one time she did not answer at all. And, you know, whatever, sometimes people forget things or make mistakes. She is not responsible for answering all the mails from her clients during the day they were sent.And then she did not show up. The way this website works, I do not really know if she knows its me, and the website is complete shit so I do not think I will be able to get my money back.I need help. I really need help, I am going to go insane. I have been trying to get help, and I am going to explode from all the thoughts going through my head and my goddamn IBS and all the other bad stuff that is happening that I cannot handle. I have nobody to talk to face to face. I have a friend I made here and we do talk to each other about our struggles but I cannot use her as a therapist, because she is a friend and not a therapist, and she cannot help me in a way a therapist can.So now I lost the money I saved. It will take at least a couple of weeks before I save enough money to see someone again. I have made a document where I talked about my past and all the dark and heavy stuff that happened to me and people I love, and now I have to start over again. I lost progress and I desperately needed progress.Now I will have to save money, find someone else, book an appointment, open up to them about all the dark and heavy stuff again somehow, have another session about all that stuff and what I expect from therapy and how this stuff is going to work, then I will be where I am right now with this therapist.Goddamn I needed progress. I needed the tools they would teach me, I needed their guidance, now I will have to start all over again. And I am running out of time. Fuck. Damn it. I got stood up by my therapist.",0
"Honestly, I am a real piece of shit human. I claim to be such a good Latter Day Saint but in reality I am not. I have strong hatred for a lot of things, and I have caused my family so much stress and pain. I am toxic and controlling when it comes to my Fianc and I pray that he finds someone better. He deserves the best and I am FAR from it. I have been in and out of therapy for so long but I am just mentally fucked. I grieve for my parents, friends, fianc and everyone else who has had the displeasure of knowing me. I feel awful for everything I have done in life. I am a lowlife loser, I cannot seem to get the will to finish college, and work has me tired out. Anyways, my fianc is going into the military. I want to wait until he is gone, and pray that he does not find out until he finished training. I want to make it look like an accident or missing persons case. I do not want anyone to know I did it to myself. I am trying to figure things out. I hate trying to plan this, and I am hoping for some miracle that my next 20 days of intensive therapy can turn it around for me. I highly doubt it tho. I think its time for the trash to take itself out. Needed to rant, had no where else to do it. Idc if nobody else hears me. Planning the end",1
"I know i could have it worse. I have a job. I have a few friends and i love my family. I think they love me. I hope they do. My best friend knows i struggle with depression but i afraid to open up to her about feeling suicidal. I am struggling to find any meaning in living if I am just sad and numb and just empty all of the time. I am too afraid to even seek out therapy. I get that I am still young, I am supposed to be 23 next week. But what is the point in seeing my birthday each year when i just know i have not accomplished anything. what is the point in living if I have been horribly depressed for almost 10 years? I have read people saying that suicidal thoughts are temporary but i really do not think they are. I used to go to class in high school and i would have vivid thoughts of my suicide after school. I have wanted to die for so long now. I am so tired. I am so tired of struggling",1
"I just cannot fucking do it man. I cannot fucking do it. it is not 'playtime's over,' playtime's been over. I am 21, going into a senior year of college abroad (if I can even still get the necessary paperwork in I put off), i constantly think I am dying due to a medical problem that is either a cancer I have put off for so long it is at the deadly point or an easily treatable infection depending on my attitude. I bounce back and forth between unfounded optimism about myself and my future and deep, crippling depression all while a fearsome anxiety immediately marks me as an immature fucker to anyone I talk to, especially authority figures. I do not have savings, in fact I am in debt not even counting soon-to-be crippling student loans. I have wasted my time on boozing or weed benders just to feel something because when I do not I cannot escape the suicidal thoughts. My family all think it but do not have the balls to say it to me. I cannot even take the bare minimum fucking steps of medical/dental appointments. I am still plagued by the fallout of my mom turning from a quirky hippie chick into a schizo methhead, and my subsequent fall from a bright kid going to the stem school and winning chess tournaments into a useless stoner fucker who cannot function in society.it is enough to want to just lay down and fucking rot. Why the fuck do i have to experience these deep, dark, depressions. I used to think it was loneliness. Then I thought it was fallout from my childhood. Then I thought it was something I could fix with some concerted effort. I neglected to realize the problem is me: I am now the /you/Iquoterelevantsongs who used to be able to make a concerted effort. Now I am just a broken she will of a motherfucker, and I am tired of maintaining this fucking husk. If I could go back and look through every throwaway and every main post I have made in times of crisis I would have something to do besides wanting to die",1

"It all started when I was 11. I was severely bullied in middle school before anti-online bullying PSAs were a thing. My mom said there are bullies everywhere and to just deal with it. Great advice there. What the fuck does that mean? My dad was more than happy to pull me out and let me be homeschooling, but mom said no so I had to stay miserable at school. By age 12 I just wanted to die and told the bullies in an AOL chatroom to which they just laughed at me and edged me to do it.Luckily, I never did do it. My father passed away and I was forced to live with my narcissistic mother. I did not know how to escape. I would dream about getting married and living somewhere else far away and never speaking to her again. I thought that was the answer to my problems. I mean, I was fired from a retail job because I could not clean the glass case properly and my mom had had enough of me being a failure with a useless Bachelor's Degree in Art. She says 14 year olds can last longer at McDonald's than me.By age 28 I was married to the love of my life and moved 3,500 miles away from where I grew up. I went no contact with my mom. I scored my dream job after being unemployed in a new country for 3 years, but now it is starting to catch up to me. I am 32 and becoming so stressed at work. I do not know how to cope. I just want to cry sometimes. I have read The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck and all kinds of self-help books, but they do not do anything for me.My neighbour bullies me just like the girls from middle school. I do not even know their name or why they do not like me. I am too afraid to leave my apartment because of it. The landlord does not care, the letting agent does not want to do anything, and the police have reported it and can only suggest we move.Finding a new place to live has been stressful. We have about 35,000 for a down-payment on a house and nobody wants to give us a mortgage. We make too much money for social housing. Right now my travel into work is dreadfully long. I do not drive so I have to take 3 buses.I am also infertile which was really hard for me to come to terms with. I also do not have any friends so if my husband were to leave me I would probably become homeless. I do not make enough to rent on my own.I just cannot deal with it. I remember asking my dad when he was alive how he dealt with stress and he said he did not know because he did not have any. Even my siblings say they are not stressed and think I am making it up for attention. My coworkers are not stressed or at least will not admit it. My boss just laughs in my face and thinks I am joking. I have tried looking for new jobs, but I have had 450+ rejections.I just want to be carefree and happy. I do not know where to go. Sometimes I feel like maybe I am better off dead in a ditch. I cannot deal with the stress of life.",1

"Heyo there!I try not to think too much about my depression but as of late it seems late I am going further and further into a bottomless pit of despair.Some background. I am 35 years of age and for about 10 years of my life well since about 20 I was living with my grandmother and taking care of her. Scrounging by and doing all kinds of jobs to make money. My dad committed suicide, we were not close so I was not too overtly affected by it. I got his life insurance policy so I used that money to pay for my expenses. It lasted me about 10 years and looking back I was pretty neglectful with my money. Anyways moving along to about 4 years ago. I apply for Federal Student Aid and that helps me out. I am getting college paid for as well as getting money to keep me afloat. There were a few close calls when I could not pay rent due to not having enough financial aid. Now to recent times. I learned that I no longer have any more financial aide and that my father before he passed ruined my credit so I cannot even qualify for personal loans. I have enough to last me through the year but after that. I have no resources to keep me afloat. I work at Target and I pretty much told them I need to work all the time because it will be the only source of income. But working retail is not very stable. I have no degree, no financial backup, nobody to help me and I am an anxiety/depressed mess right now. That and I do not know of any places aside from factory and sales that I could work where I make enough and is pretty stable. I feel like I am just going to be a giant mess with nothing and nobody come next year and that is scary as hell.I am scheduled to see a professional and I basically am going to see if they can help me get my life on track. I am old and I feel like it is too little too late. If anybody has any advice or anything I would greatly appreciate hearing from you! I mean at this point I am just stuck we are in endgame now",0

I am currently living at home with my verbally abusive mother in a very toxic environment. I want to move out aspa, but I am working a sh*tty job that does not pay well and if I do save up enough. I would be broke for the foreseeable future. I have seen so many CV councillors and applied to so many jobs, and despite all of that I have not been offered any interviews.To sum up my love life, it has been pain. I have never had a partner or anything like that. Every now and again I match with someone we vibe and hit things off, but after a date or two I get ghosted, leaving me confused and hurt as to why they lost interest. I feel undesirable and unworthy of love. I feel like I need to be perfect in every way order to even be considered as a romatic partner. I feel the same way when it comes to job applications. it is mentally taxing and painful.All of this is having a massive effect on my mental health and I am noticing it deteriorating quickly. I hate that I am thinking about just ending it. But I guess I need to know when to quit, I have struggled with knowing when to quit all my life. I guess I was always the hopeful optimist. But what is the point in trying when put all my efforts in trying to make my life better and I still end up in the same place. I keep telling myself be strong, I hype myself up into a positive mindset and a good mood and for what? Nothing seems to change, well nothing permanent. The cycle continues. It feels like everything is working against me, and simple things that should be straight forward are not.And I get life's not fair and I accept that, but it feels like the difficulty was dailed up to 1000 for me. I do not think anyone can save or help me. I have prayed and begged to whatever cosmic being might be out there. Praying for them to give me a break, give me a win, on which I can build on and make my life better. I do not know what I did to deserve this, whether is this life or past or whatever but I am sorry.I have got so much unresolved pain.I know life has it is rough patches but I would at least like some level of happiness.

If it was someone who lived in my city in australia, who could actually be a real-life friend, that would be something. I mean I would still worry about being too depressed to be worth it.And to be honest, making friends is not really a priority for me until I find a partner. But anyway.I have this throwaway account and a regular one. I do not know what is up with the reddit notification system, but I just scrolled back through out of boredom, and between both accounts I have like 4 messages from people. All from like a year ago. Some of them were answering me responding to their r4r post. Girls my age who might have been something for me.I did not see any of those fucking messages and I feel awful about it. I could have been happier by now. I could have met someone. Guilt about social avoidance",0
I have had depression for almost eighteen years now and I thought I had mostly gotten a grip on the suicidal and self harming aspects of it. But lately a lot of those kind of thoughts have come back. I know its the stress I am dealing with that is exacerbating my poor mental health. All I want to do is sleep but I struggle falling asleep because anxiety and stress keeps me up. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of tears. I keep thinking about how I really should start seeing a professional but I am worried about affording it. I am just dealing with an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and I feel myself pushing away the people I care about most. I am the worst I have been in a long time,0

"Hey everyone. I am 14, and all my life I have struggled with anxiety, OCD, and in the past 2 years I have really started to struggle with a depressive disorder. My plan is to ask a doctor about bipolar disorder this year. I have lost so many friends. So many friends. I lost the best girlfriend I could have ever asked for. I feel like a failure and that life is just over. I wake up crying, I cry every night. I am constantly stressed over so much. I cannot be happy for more then 15 minutes. Therapy and meds have not helped. I am really struggling, just wanted to open up and try to help some other people.Thanks This is my first post here in this community",0
I just want to take all my pills tomorrow when my husband is gone for work and not show up to my job. Will they even fucking care. Ot I will slit my wrists in the tub. Noting helps my cat is dying and it is my fault I cannot help himI've failed my marriage with my fucking problemsHe'll be better riff without me I just want to die,1
"Feeling blue right now. I am sure you all know what this means and how it feels like. do not even have the energy to write further. Wish I could just sleep until a better time comes. When they say oh I am so happy you called me, they mean I would never call you first.",0
"Maybe if I fucking died every goddamn thing would be fine. that is right, I am a weirdo, a freak, an attention whore",1
"I really did. And then an hour ago I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. I could not walk, could not stand up, whatever. I think that if I had a gun with me I would not have hesitated to kill myself, my brain was just... gone. I have too much to say, but my eyes are closing. So maybe Ill be better tomorrow. I thought I was doing better.",1
"I feel like I do not know what to do next. I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and I have for a while but for some reason it is just... Horrible this week. I do not have the best past and to this day I do not exactly think I am a good person. I used to be aggressive and I did not care about a lot of stuff and I would hurt people physically. I am not like that now but I find myself.... Slipping into the old meI was on a walk with my roommates about 2 days ago and I was just talking about science because I thought it was cool, but I guess for some reason she was telling me that it is not true and that it is a theory and stuff. I do not want to call her stupid or anything, but she has a disorder where her mental age is that of a kid. So she likes to act smart even if there is proof that it is right and she is wrong. it is her own thing I guess.But anyway I... Slipped into my old self.... I started being a dick and going out of my way to prove her wrong... And it... eventually hit me... And I have not talked much in two daysFriday morning (I think) I was up early (1:00ish) and I went to a bridge... I stood there for about 30 minutes... thoughts rushing though my head. Then I went home at like 3:00 since I have not been able to sleep. So I decided to wake my roommates (her and her boyfriend) and I opened up... And that is something I never did. I told them everything that was going on, about who I used to be... And the part that echos through my head... Is when she said something and the way my mind saw it was like... Kind of pitty in a way... And I got furious... I grabbed my shoes and I threw them against the wall. Then I stopped myself...I eventually went back to sleep... And I ended up crying a good portion of the day. I think my roommates thought I was asleep because they never checked on me. I eventually did fall asleep. Then I woke up around 8:00 and I went to find them. Maybe they were doing something. They were outside walking around playing Pokemon Go.I walked with them and I made some comments that... Old me would say... So I shut up... That was around 11:00 and it is now 3:00 for me... And I keep having that rushing thoughtIf I kill myself who would care? I feel like I do not want to live with guilt and PTSD for things I have done... I keep thinking... I have a plan and stuff to... I... do not know what is stopping me.... that is the odd part... I do not have biological parents I know, I only have adopted parents, who do not really care. My mom says ""if you kill yourself, we will be sad but we will not be broken"" and that hurtsI've eventually come to the conclusion that I do not like my roommate because she reminds me of a lot of things that... Old me did....I do not want to be here... I feel like no one loves me and no one cares about anything I do... I feel like.... I am here... Suffering I do not want to be here and it is getting worse",1
"I used to be the person who would talk to everyone, i cannot even hold a conversation anymore because my mind goes blank. I am a fucking idiot, God i hate myself I cannot even talk to people anymore",0
"i do not want to die, i just want to be at peace. i spend all of my free time asleep. i do not even know how my body can sleep as much as i do but, man, is it comforting. there is nothing more comforting than being asleep. even with my extreme nightmares every night, i would not trade that feeling of bliss for the world. i wish i could feel it forever. i just want to sleep forever",1
"Ever since I was about 13ish. I think its because I feel like I am being tauntedthat I should be outside enjoying life, with people. I prefer when its cloudy and rainingthunderstorms are even better. The irony is I thought I had SAD, especially in college. But nope just all year(life) long depression. Sunshine, especially in the summertime, makes me more depressed",0
I just need a friend.. Can anyone near Chicago save me?,1
Abuse is fucked up.Everytime I think I can outrun it. It gets worse. To a point where I cannot even do anything about it.what is the point I really want to do it,1
Sorry it is probably pointless to type here as this is my first reddit post. But I do not want anyone to think I will not be okay. But I just think I should not be involved in anyone's lives anymore all I do is ruin a good moment and take advantage of my friends. Worse part is I have basically a perfect life so I do not deserve to even be upset. Thank you for reading Ill be okay after I sleep I think. Friendship,0
"I am 24, my entire life up to this point has been fucked, filled with mental illness, rejection, autism, isolation, working my ass off to the max just to be completely let down? I first wanted to kill myself when I was 10, and my parents were so worried and reassured me I had incredible years in front of me:I am still waiting for that incredible year. Otherwise, boy would it have been nice mot to suffer thru these past 14 years. Its truly disgusting how not a single one has been good and my life is drifting away.I am at a point where I know it would be naive of me to try to act as if they are ever coming. Because they are fucking not. And they never will.The sole factor has been not wanting to hurt others. But honestly, I think Ill relieve as many people as Ill hurt. And regardless, who really cares? Anyone just know the rest of their life will be fucked?",1
"To whomever it may or may not concern,I am sorry I am not very much myself at all. This is not me. For which I mean to say, I have seen better days, felt more like me...had a heartbeat with more lightness in it. If you are looking for someone to blame for it, it seems apparent to blame me. After all, I have no one to pin this on, except myself. And it has taken me years to accept that it might just be my fault anyway...not a factor of different traumas, and past abuse...not a lack of understanding the cruelty of the world around me and discovering dissapointment like I discovered my own talents......me....this is all my fault...for being the way I am...for making you all worry and look at me with bewilderment and disinterest...I do not blame you...I have blamed myself for years for it...I think I still do. But, just know that for each and every punishment I receive, self inflicted, my faults are being corrected. that is why I am in this cage you see. that is why I cannot come out...I have tossed out the key, so I would not think to ask for it. And now, I just wait here...in the darkness. I wait for the end. But it will not come. Of course not...I am in a cage. Nothing can get in here to kill me...except for myself. Oh do not worry my friends. I will not do anything too bad. Certainly will not leave without telling you all first...though it is tempting to. After all...did you really remember me when I was gone for all those years?...perhaps, you thought of me, every so often. Maybe there was something in your day, a voice, a joke, a toy, a song, a movie, that reminded you of me. That put a smile on your face, thinking of the good times we shared together...a nice afternoon in the summer, sharing ice cream....a pizza party with a game of hide and go seek.....a sleepover with pajamas and board games....maybe video games and anime....maybe a friendly dinner and a walk through the town....I miss those times too. But they are all over. Dead and still, only living in our minds. I want to join those memories, but I cannot you say, not when I can make new menories...not while I can have better times.But to be honest...from this cage of mine, I do not see how I can. So I sit and lie down and roll around...clutching the memories I have. I am not brave enough to ask you all for more. I am not brave enough to welcome new ones. I have...been stripped of my courage. I am naked. Cold and silent. Unable to cry for help...like a fish out of water. I am only able to struggle in my suffocation...I am drying out...I gaze up and away...I lay still. I want to give up. I need someone to return me to myself again. I do not ask you to do this for me. I am a slippery fish. I am an unwilling victim of self-awareness. I will resist and bite and run. I will run. I will hide....I am afflicted by something that prevents me from getting rid of it, little by little...and it is powerful. It grips me with a vice, and uses my stripped courage as a trophy to intimidate me. it is a monster. And it is myself. I am it is underling. I serve it, and obey it is command....and the orders are killing me.Soon I will not be so alone my friends. I might not be anything. Or I might have company. I might actually be understood. I am sorry I am so presumptuous in assuming that you do not understand me, but...that is simply what this monster tells me. Each and every one of you I know, has problems. Has struggles. Has traumas. I do not understand them...so why would you understand mine? Not while I see your shining lives and sunny faces convey a message of health to me, that I am distant from. I lament my ignorance and my innocence, though I try to hold onto what is left of it is destroyed remains. I have cried, and grieved over the places I used to go for comfort, no longer welcome to me. I have nothing....I have...no one...because of this cage. Please, you need not claim your loyal hold on our friendship and make the effort to be there. I would think the world of it...and I would also panic immensely about it. My trust, having been shaken so much, I worry that I will not have much trust left if I give it away so freely. It must hurt to hear from me that I cannot put my trust in you....I am sorry....I do not mean to hurt you. I only mean to push you away, and to reject your kind words and thoughts and gestures...so I can stay in this dark. So you cannot take me away from the monster trying to kill me. I just want to make you leave me alone, so I can help this cursed monster spread into you. I need to deterr you from helping me, even though your help is something that will save my life. I need to keep you from caring about me because if I do not...I am going to feel like a total, parasitic burden. I am going to feel it all at once...I am going to break down, into the soft-fleshed, vulnerable, delicate little creature I am. There will be nothing to keep you from hurting me the most, and I will be in such as state the likes of which has not been seen. I will need comfort, and if I go without it, I will be hurt just as much as if you would step on me. I will be helpless. I will be weeping rivers. All the anger, and loneliness and years of loathing and self-pity will come in a wave so large I will catch a cold from the tears I leave behind. I am in pain to tell you this...but I know you do not need this in your life. You do not need to help me. You do not need to care. You do not need to feel so sorry. I know you have better things to do. You have people that care for you more than I do. You have lives to live. You have things to look forward to. You must. Because I do too. I just cannot see them from where I am.Dear friends...I hope maybe I can see you again someday. I hope I can make you proud someday. I hope you understand...I wish I could be myself with you again... Dear Friends : A Letter of Self Remorse",0

"If you check my profile you will see that she is currently hospitalized for self-harm watch. I was trying to organize her things yesterday and I found a bunch of notes that were for different people she really cared about. I read mine and it was undoubtedly the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I could not get a hold of her hospital so I called her mom so that she could inform the doctor since I am not supposed to see her right now. Her mom is nearly demanding I turn over the notes to her because she really wants to read them. I refused saying it was not something anyone should ever read. I only read it because I was not sure what it was and it was addressed to me. My question is, am I an asshole for not giving her the notes or am I doing the right thing? I found my ex-gfs suicide notes",1
"Honestly I do not really know why, I am always down or just feel alone and tired. I am young(20 well 21 my birthday next Friday) but most of my life, I have had more downs than ups. Bullied, cheated on, sabotaging my own relationships, etc. I wanted to be the guy that does the right things. But it just keep getting worse, like I have this ex that I dated years before(we still talk, were actually friends), I broke it off bc I felt like she needed someone better than me. But stupidly gotten into another relationship basically rushed it. Now idk if I have feelings for her, does not matter she found another guy. Which is fine I am happy for her, but damn it hurt. My birthday next Friday and Ill be 21 years old and sadly and honestly I have been thinking about taking my life that day. I just do not want feel anymore, I tried to fight off these thoughts but hey you cannot win every battles yea? I do not know I just felt like actually saying it. Bad part about it I cannot tell my friends or family, they have they are own things to deal with, its better this way. Down bad ig",0
"Every single thing that has happend to me since childhood has caused me PAIN. I believe everytime that things will change for better but they end up hurting me the most.

If there is anyone as said God, please for once, please take me away. I have waited for you to bring the magical change in life only to realize everything I ever gotten so far is also going to because me pain for eternity. Please take me away!

"so i did not have a normal childhood, but i do not want to talk about it today. all i can say is i was not a happy child like i should have been. and i really think this made me who i am: i cry easely, i am the most sensitive person i know. it is like a curse ti be honest. i hate myself so much for that. it is not smth i can control because if i could control it i fucking would, but no one ubderstands that. ""you cry for the most insignificant things!!!!!"" I have always been invalidated. even when i was a little stupid child i was invalidated for my feelings. they made me fucking believe that jokes about appearence are normal. they made me believe abuse is normal in a relationship (my trauma comes from second-hand abuse, long story short I have been born and raised surrounded by abuse, screams etc). anyway. sometimes my dad ""jokes"" about me being a mistake. today i was talking to my parents and i do not remember the conv quite well but he goes ""you were not even planned"". and mom laughed. i know not every child is planned but... like, is it normal for someone to hear that occasionally? like, I am wrong for being upset? a short time ago he was like ""i did not even want you"". am i crazy? after what he told me i started to cry and my mom told me i cry for stupid things and i should not care. i told you she even laughed.. is this funny? i do not fucking find it funny i find it so wrong. like it hurts me, how can i laugh at that? why is it normal? why should i find it normal? is it?.. i was not even a plan",1

"My daughter who is about to turn 14 has always been different. She is diagnosed with being on the spectrum. She has social anxiety and a little learning disability. I held her back in the 3rd grade because she was reading well but since then took off. Gets mostly As, a few Bs. Socially though only a couple friends she has. She does not like being in crowds at all. does not like loud noises. We have adapted and things been really good. If you met her you would think she is a happy go lucky kid. She just started getting her period and it all went to hell. does not matter if she is on it or not she has gotten mean toward her sisters. She confided in me that she feels dead inside and is not happy, cannot feel joy. I asked her if she ever felt like hurting herself and she says no. I asked her if we can talk to someone about this and get help and she absolutely refuses and would never talk to me if I made her go talk to a doctor. Also made me swear to tell no one. Her Mom called me today (we are divorced) and told me she noticed changes in her and her lashing out at people. I do not know what to do, force her to go to counceling. She needs help. She needs to know how to deal with her feelings and that she does not have to feel this way. Any suggestions? I need some advice for my 14 year old daughter",0
"I am not sure where to start.. there is many things wrong in my life. However I do not think I have even ""lived"" to begin with. I am 17 since mid june and I feel like I have already wasted my entire life. I have never been in a relationship.(even though I have been asked out a few times before, however I have always rejected them due to several reasons.) I have never been to a party. I have never done drugs or got drunk. I have never had many friends and I have been bullied all throughout my school life. One of the people I have considered my friend in middle school, bullied and used me. She even sexually assaulted and tried to humiliate me with that in public. I have only realized that she was not really my friend later on.My best (and only) friend that I have known since pretty much forever, never texts me back. He always tells me that he forgot to check his messages, even though I see him interact with other people and post stuff daily on the app we chat with. it is been four days since we last texted and I feel annoying and clingy. And I am pretty sure he feels that way about me. I know that everyone does. I am nothing more than a burden to everyone around me. The only time I was any good was when I was groomed into taking off my clothes and participating in sexual roleplay in front of many adult men online when I was 11-13 I guess.. I did it because of my low self-esteem, body issues(I still almost cry when looking into the mirror tbh.)and loneliness, it was the first time i felt someone actually wanted me around. I now know that it was wrong and that I was sexually abused.When I was around 11 years old I have started to get suicidal thoughts and when I was 12 I have almost stabbed myself in the stomach Infront of my older sister and my mother. Both of them called me a freak and said that I was sick in the head. I am still saying that I want to die pretty much daily and they do not really care. Even one time a few weeks ago, I have told my mother before going to bed that I will kill myself that night, because I was so sure that I was going to do it. She again did not care. Just like when I was growing up, she was rather on her phone than paying any attention to me. I do not think my dad knows about all of that. Even if he did, I am pretty sure that he would not care either. My only (childhood) memories of him are just him yelling at me. I mean I was an accidental child after all, makes sense that they rather want me gone.I think I am destined to be a failure and kill myself. I was always the weird, shy kid that barely smiled. My house burned down when I was around 6 years old, which made me even worse. The only thing that actually still gives me somewhat joy is my teddybear that my grandmother gave me for Christmas when I was 3. I know it is kind of pathetic and sad but it was one of the only things that did not burned to a crisp. Something else that gave me joy and an actual reason to live was my cat who passed away. Tomorrow it will be two year without her. I miss her so much. Most times she was the only one who comforted me when I was crying and when I felt alone. The only real one. I am a maladaptive daydreamer, I have been doing it since I can even remember. I often daydream about my favorite characters from mostly anime comforting and being with my all the time, from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep. It makes me feel even worse and lonely. I use fiction to distract myself from everything. Scrolling through social media and seeing drawings and fanfiction of my favorite characters helps and it actually makes me feel happy sometimes. However those feelings quickly vanish when I snap back to reality.I know that I am just a pathetic and weird loner, who should just die. I have been going to a therapist since april and that does not help me either. I mean, I have gotten diagnosed with social anxiety and I am probably being tested for depression after I have got tested for autism in october. But who knows if I even live that long?I do not think that I will. My life has been miserable. And I am scared of my future. I am pretty much done with school and I have no idea what to do in life. So I should just take the easy way out.I am not sure if anyone's going to actually read this. If you do, I apologize. This post is a mess and I am pretty sure it is hard to read. I just wrote all of my current thoughts down. Also english is not my first language, sorry.Just know that I will not be doing it now or in the next few hours. Writing everything down kind of helped me with not committing suicide. But I cannot promise that I am not doing it this month or the next one. I already give in to the urge to cut myself, so giving in to the urge to ending it all is not far off, right? lol.I think I am just going to sleep soon. it is 2:10 AM where I live and I am pretty tired right now. I hope that you are alright. And I hope you have a nice day/night.(Good)bye. Why even bother with living?",1
"I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it, but long story short, I am getting better after months of medication, therapy, etc. My anxiety is at an all-time low and my antidepressants """"do not allow"""" my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not ""tried harder"" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??",0
My doctor prescribed a low dose (20mg) cymbalta to help with some corneal neuropathic pain. It seemed it help for the few days I took it but then I read all of the issues people have coming off of it versus other antidepressants and discontinued it due to that. My nerve pain is now back and I am on the fence about taking it again since it really did help (I also have some mild anxiety and depression so it was a plus to help with those also). The general consensus online seems to be that it is an absolutely terrible drug to have to taper off of and people seem to develop chronic issues from it even after being off of it a while. My doctor simply tells me do not worry about that when I inquired about the withdrawals. Can any medical professionals give me some input? Is it really that bad for most people? I would like to not be in pain anymore but also do not want to because meow problems for myself in the long run Is tapering off of cymbalta as scary as people make it seem? It helps me but I am scared to keep taking it,0
"No intro, straight to the message on this one. I had a dream the other day. I was in a tall building with my parents, we all went to an event like a wedding or something. We were laughing and joking on the parking lot. We go upstairs on an elevator and get to the event. For some reason I had to go to the parking lot again, so I took the elevator again. The doors open on the first floor and I just see this beautiful young woman (around my age) with the most beautiful energy that I have ever witnessed. I did not knew her, but I needed her, no more and no less. She smiles to me and I smile back and I start a conversation with her. We both needed to go to the third floor (for some reason it was that specific floor), but the elevator did not worked. I asked if we could walk together and she smiles and says yes. We talk for what I felt like minutes but in reality we have spent a couple months together! I could just not believe it. We still not found the way up so I said to her: hey, what if we just go home? She thinks about it and says yes. O know were both scared but we still start going to the exit and we go to the street as we head home our home! We open the door, and our families are meeting each other because we were just married. I speak to my parents and she tells me to go to the bedroom when I am finished. I end up talking to my parents so I am headed to the bedroom, and she tells me to chill for a while with her so we cuddle in the bed. Then she tells me to check on you are daughter just in front of the bed. I check on her and she is the most beautiful thing I have seen just as her mother. We cuddle again. And there is when it hits me: it was like I have had the Titanic in the chest. I have realized that I had as much as I could ever asked for. I had a beautiful wife, had a daughter, a home, family I was happy, I had peace, I felt a fulfilled life. And just as I cuddle with her, close my eyes and tell her that I love her so i could be happy forever I woke upMy smart watch detects my sleep. I checked out as usual and during the REM phase my heartbeats went extremely lower than usual and i could not breath. This dream, this dream specifically almost kills me. I think it was the last part, I was going to simply give up. I had everything I wanted, I felt fulfilled as I always wanted to.I think there was a war inside me in that moment. The part of me that wants to give up ve the one that will do whatever it takes to survive for something better. And I almost lost. I am not sleeping with the watch anymore soTo anyone reading this: If I lose this battle against myself, do not worry for me because I was happy and fulfilled. In my last moments I experienced love, satisfaction and the peace that I needed for so long. I am with the ones that I am missing on this earth, catching up and taking care of my loved ones even from far away. If I die",0

"I am 24 now and I am still the same piece of shit I was 10 years ago. I started cutting when I was 12. My arms, my legs, my stomach. I constantly have to make sure that no one sees them. I tried to kill myself when I was 13. Everyday I wake up and look at my arm. it is still visible. It fucks me over. Day after day, after day. I can remember it all so clearly, it is a constant nightmare. It hurts to relive it every single day. The pain is still there and never left. I wish I would have never started to cut, it is just a daily reminder that I am too weak to kill myself. I still see my scars from 10 years ago",1

The fact that we are alive is due to all our effort that is put into existing or trying to get better, it is a lot.Despite your brain telling you that you are worse than the scummiest scum.

I am lucky the cut was not deep and i did not cut close enough to a veinhow can I even try to keep myself alive? sure life is full fucking pain and agony right now, but jesus christ. I have nobody to talk to who is actually there for me in my life, especially not my family I went down to my kitchen for some food, next thing I know I fucking attempted suicide",0

"I am so doneI had a breakdown 2 hours ago and I feel like I am going to get another soon again. I was laying on bed, holding a knife up to my stomach, wondering if i should let it drop or stab myself. But despite my total mind block, still could not imagine the pain or laying here bleeding for like next few hours possibly not even dying.Wish i had access to gun or just own one, would go in some quiet abandoned place and just shoot myself in peaceTold myself to stay or at least try survive this summer. But I do not see really that one happening anymore, i do not know what am i going to to dofuck I am mentally destroyed",1
"My med dr has tried everything and I am in therapy every week. I am so depressed. I am unable to function and my boss is putting me on medical leave because I just cannot do my work. Health insurance does not cover the treatment my dr wanted and if it was not for the cost I would probably admit myself to some kind of psych ward while on medical leave. I just do not know what to do with these restrictions. I wish the answer was as simple as a brain scan, see what is wrong, fix the problem. I just have that deep pain of dread in my chest and it has been a long time. I do not know what else to do",0
"I get the whole in sickness and health thing but when is enough, enough? My husband and I both are dealing with mental health issues its been a very stressful time for us. I have seeked out help to talk to someone but he refuses. Although we both have this issueI do not particularly pin it on him or do things that would disrespect him or our relationship. Him on the other handis depressed and antsy and feels like hes not far enough in life as he wants to be suddenly so he leaves the house and does not come home and does not answer his phone. Hes done that probably 10 times in the last month and a half. He knew the very FIRST time he did it that I was very upset and that its something I do not like. He continued though and claims its because of his mental health. So at this point its like would I be wrong for wanting to get my own place and be away from and let him fix his issues on his own? Or should I stay because hes going through something even though what hes doing is making my own mental health decline even more? Thank you in advance for any advice. I need advice",0
"18, M. Let me just get straight into it.For the past 3 months now, every time I pass my window, I am almost 100% certain someone is watching me and it stresses me out and makes me anxious. I feel watched inside my room - almost like people can see through the wall. But it does not stop there. I feel spied by the government every time I use an electronic device and that they are plotting against me. I have blocked my camera with something, which has helped a bit, but I still feel like they are listening to my thoughts through the camera somehow. When I am alone in my room, I sometimes sense another presence. And it does not stop there.I do not trust many of my friends. I believe some of them are masters at manipulation and I am too socially inexperienced to detect it. I 'read' things hidden messages in casual conversations at times. When I say goodbye to them, my first thought is that they are talking behind my back, and it makes me question whether I should stop hanging out with them. Sometimes, it becomes too much, so I end accusing them of manipulation/lies and become aggressive. Of course, they are in complete denial. This is where I start to question whether any of my thoughts are real. I cannot trust my own thoughts, but I do not trust the words of others either. These thoughts pop up every day out of nowhere. They are so intrusive and inescapable that I just want to die because the anguish is unbearable. It is like my thoughts are disturbed and incohesive. I then wake up the next day, unable to recognize any of my beliefs and thoughts from the night before. My thoughts also are not disturbed or incohesive; they are somewhat normal again.FYI, I have been diagnosed with Aspergers and BPD, but this does not resemble any of my diagnoses. I am feeling suicidal because of it and I just got checked out from the psychiatry a week ago after being hospitalized for two weeks. I told them about my paranoia, but they did not really seem to acknowledge it, which I do not get at all. All they gave me is another diagnosis (Aspergers).. I do not know how much I can hold on anymore I do not know how much I can handle anymore",1

"I have been living alone since June and all of my roommates work back at their hometown for the summer. (I am in college). It is currently killing me inside being alone.With not having any of my friends in town, I have been able to hang out with some other people i never really got to know until this summer. Truly, i really like this group of people that I have gotten closer with, the only problem is I have managed to catch extreme feelings with one of the girls there. She feels the exact same way towards me.. in a way. She got out of a relationship this past May and long story short, she wanted to stay as friends because we just were not on the same level. she is just not ready for anything despite the feelings she has for me. So this girl just removed all her feelings for me overnight. I feel like utter trash. I did not do anything wrong, and with this happening it makes hanging out with this group very hard because of my situation with her. do not get me wrong, her and i could try something again when she is ready. But this hurts me right now.What I am trying to get to is I feel like i do not have anyone. This depression is taking a huge toll on me mentally. I have had many suicidal thoughts before and i have always mentioned it with my brother or someone I am extremely close with. But i have not said anything to anyone this time, which scares me. I truly have not been able to enjoy anything this summer.To add to this, i have lost 16 pounds this summer solely off of my appetite.I am alone with my own thoughts literally all day and this situation with the girl makes everything 5x harder. I feel I was not good enough. She said I showed her what she truly deserved and that she was so happy to have me. She left the next week. I am in such a hole, and i truly feel i cannot make it out of this one. I do not know.",1
"I am so tired of everything and I genuinely cannot do this anymore. Everyone seems to love me more when I am productive and doing schoolwork, but the moment I begin struggling its like I have disappointed everyone. I have always heavily based my self worth on my grades, and now that I do not know things I am struggling. Physics makes no goddamn sense and I am for sure going to fail my exam on it. Not to mention that my room is messy, and no matter how long I spend cleaning it, the mess always comes back. I might be a dick for saying this, but it feels like my parents care less about my mental health, and more about me doing dishes. I have a good life, I love my family and my friends, but I do not know how much longer I can live this way. I am so scared to mention any of this to my parents again because they always talk about how selfish suicide is, and how it would wreck the family. It makes me feel guilty for having unsavoury thoughts and now I do not know what to do. Fuck it all",1
I have wanted to die since I was 7. I should have died. I want to die. But friends keep me here and I hate it. I hate being alive. I hate breathing. I hate everything in my life. do not even bother looking through my search history for a reason to live. I just need to find a painless way to die because life is not worth living. I hate everyone and everything in my life. I want to die. I have wanted to die for years but no one let us me. Now I am stuck in a shitty life. Thanks world.,1
"Sorry if the post is not in order/detailed I am tired and I just keep revising what I write in the post the more I think the harder it is to get out I am mainly just putting out what comes to mind at the momentI've felt been way for around 7 years now but I have never really had the motivation to make a post about it I am unsure of what to do.So I experience anhedonia daily I just mostly feel numb without being sad unless I start thinking about my appearance and other things in my life. I can a hard time remembering things/learning and being motivated to get certain stuff done. Also I have an anxious tic that makes me jerk my neck when I am around people for more than a minute. I feel somewhat apathetic when it comes to dealing with other people emotional connections are and are not really there but I still feel very lonely sometimes and its hard to talk to other people. I have tried catting to people on reddit and apps but I just end always up getting ghosted so I have pretty much given up on doing that since its just going to go down to the same dead end road.I find it hard to return calls to cousins who just want to talk or check up on me.I just sit in my room 24/7 playing video games all day,watch videos, etc to just pass the time so I can go to sleep. I only leave my house to drop off packages after people buy cards from me on ebay. I have tried going on walks, picking up new hobbies, playing with the family puppy,etc nothing has really made me feel happy just make the day end faster.My mom keeps asking me when I am going to get a girlfriend and that she wants grandkids she says it occasionally it feels kind of insulting to me. She tells me that I am handsome,etc when I am a fat dude and a below average face with mental issues.I want to get multiple cosmetic surgerys which I am saving up for with the cards that I am selling and with a job I can possibly get if my interview goes well. Getting that done would definitly boost my mental health espeically when it comes to meeting people irl.I have not talked to my mom about it but I am sure she would not be ok with the idea of someone cutting my face open and moving things forward/placing things.I have been trying to lose weight for the past year but I have gained it all back due to a recent event which makes me just want to shut in even moreLate at night on March 30th I tried with my rifle by shooting myself in the heart but I ended up jerking the rifle to the left and accidentally hitting my sister in the hand through the wall I did not plan anything out did it out of compuslion because of my thoughtsSince that event I have gained around 60-70lbs pretty much most of the weight that I have lost over the year, became more suicidal after I read the report in court they are trying to charge me with attempted murder and accused me of doing it in the hallway, For whatever reason they were blind enough not to see the hole in the wall and they are sending down an investigator to come and take a look at it which is making me feel a little better but still like shit I have never had trouble with the law,etc and my life is possibly being thrown straight down the toilet I saw a therapist through zoom for around a month and talked to him about my problems I no longer see him because he cancelled it after I did not talk about deep issues with him on the last week, I am assuming that is why but he never told me thoughI do not think this is going to get any better for me without taking something to keep me going longer.Is it possible for me to get medications without seeing a doctor in person? I brought this up to my mom one time she cried and we never talked about it again and I do not think she wants me medicatedAgain I apologize if what i wrote is not in order or detailed, or does not make sense just want to get this out while I have some motivation to do it and I am tired. Thanks for reading How depressed am I and is it possible to get meds without a doctor (wall of text)",0
"Sorry for the book. I am seriously at the end of my rope and just need to vent. Plus I do not know what to do. I feel so hopeless in life anymore, like anything I try to do to correct it will NEVER work, and I am just going to go on suffering.So I live in a medium density metropolitan area... so while I have many options for therapists, I kept running into those who are not accepting new patients (used the Psychology Today finder). One of them eventually referred me to a Psychotherapy group who has many various counselors/therapists, and it was almost 6 month wait to be seen. I figured, whatever, if I have to wait I might as well start waiting now.I have now had two sessions and my therapist appears to be completely inept and absent. My first appointment I joined virtually. I left work early, went to a park since I have no real privacy elsewhere, and connected in my car using my cell.He was 23 minutes late for the hour-long session. Being among those who have likely experienced self-defeating thoughts, you can imagine how I was sitting there wondering if he forgot, if there was some screw up, then leading to how everything I try goes wrong and never works, maybe I should just give up, etc. I know these thoughts are illogical but they take over when I am left to them.Well he finally shows up and asks what I want to get out of therapy. So I begin to describe my severe anxiety and depression, possibly how it relates to childhood trauma, and how it is affecting my family life. How it is causing major strife visiting family due to friction directly related to it, how I need help dealing with my emotions from it and working through it with my family. Totally started opening up. It was the first time really talking to anyone about this stuff.It was pretty apparent that in 6 months he never actually read the new-patient information I filled out, which described in specific detail all of this. That was the whole intention of the form. He was completely unaware of any of it. But, I did not even care at the time. He was listening and I was hopeful.Beyond that, I picked up on some warning signs when I was describing my trauma, and he asked approximately 4 times, ""and how old were you when that happened""? Twice in a period of about 2-3 minutes, then another couple times when I circled back to the topic. He was not retaining or processing half of what I was saying. But, still he seemed to care and it at least felt good to talk, so I was not overly concerned.He stopped the session at the time it would have stopped if he was on-time, so I really only had half a session.Two weeks later the second session comes. He had invited me to come in, in-person going forward. For some reason this time they would not charge it from my HRA so I had to pay $130 out-of-pocket for the deductible, but that is another story...he is on time this time. I had mentioned I just got out of work and he starts asking questions about work. I thought it was rapport building or whatnot but he began to dig deeper and deeper into work, asking about stressors, etc. This morphed into financial responsibilities, and the stresses those can because, and other related things. After a while I felt it got off the rails. This was not the reason I requested therapy, as stated on my new patient forms and in my first session. But, I figured he is going somewhere with it.Well it ended up with the therapist honing in on responsibilities / finances / obligations causing a weight on my shoulders, and how we can work more on that next time.WTF?I understand he might not remember every little detail from our first session, but it was like he had no clue what I was there for? I left feeling defeated. Realization set in that the first session where I poured my heart out was completely unaccounted for, and that my therapist thinks I am just there for some sort of job/financial stress management.Part of my issues include low confidence and very little assertiveness. People have always walked all over me. As such I could not bring myself to ask any ""confrontational"" questions about whether he recalls the topics of the first session, or why we are not building on those. I just kind of realized it was a loss and that was that.As a couple days went by I began to become more depressed as I felt even more hopeless, and after 6 months of waiting... for this!? For literally nothing!? Then it turned into anger, which is not like me. But I am truly pretty upset that the person I was counting on helping me never bothered to review my initial forms or take notes on what my issues are. That he barely seems to retain information I told him one or two sentences ago, let alone the entire reason I am sitting in front of him.The fuck do I do now? I have not cancelled my third session. I figured maybe I should go at least three times to make sure. But not going to lie, I checked reviews and while there are not many, they said he was the worst therapist they would ever had.I am on medication at least. Thought it has not helped yet. Started with Lexapro which even at the initial dosage, it was making me super ill to my stomach for weeks on end. It did not agree with me.Moved on to Zoloft and it has not really started helping yet, but my stomach is fine now. It had some heavy sexual side effects so my doctor added Wellbutrin about a week and a half ago. Still no change in mood or the side effects but I am hoping this starts to kick in for now. I know it can take a while.Fuck. Waited 6 months for my first psychotherapy appointment. After 2 sessions it was so bad I now feel WORSE",0
"My grandmother told me you are not the granddaughter I know when I opened up about my abuse and trauma from my parents when I got into an argument with them. I also spoke about my depression as well. She told me that I should never tell my friends about my abuse or trauma since they will walk away. I am glad to have some supportive friends but recently I have been pretty burned out from the constant abusive words I am faced with everyday. I have not really talked to anyone since I just have no energy at all. Maybe I should take my grandmas advice and never EVER open up about my abuse and trauma. Hell, maybe I should stop doing to my therapist all together since Ill never be able to beat my depression. My whole life just continues to spiral down. Its gotten to the point where I have been contemplating suicide again since I have previously failed years ago. I just wish my father swung his wooden chair lower so that he would of bashed open my skull so I would be dead Your not the granddaughter I know",1
"Finally set a date to end my life in August. Just quit my job and currently sitting in my car, it feels like such a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.I want to enjoy the last few weeks/months of my life doing things I have always wanted to do. I have a $5000 credit limit on my credit card and I am going to max it out before I go. I am thinking of going to a nice steakhouse, maybe sushi a couple times, skydiving, and a couple other things right now. going to add some more stuff as I think of it. Just quit my job, going to enjoy my last few weeks on my own terms",0
"I am a 25M and I have been dead for almost 10 years. Yes, I am still alive in the physical sense of the term, moving through life. The the day ""I"" dead will always be the days off my youth. I committed suicide of the soul through constant acts of self hatred, depression, and anxiety. These of which are not just decisions of ones to look past, but ones that forever effect the way I see my self and others see me. I genuinely despise everything about myself, do not think through decisions, never finish anything, constantly self destruct. I lay in bed all day, drink, do drugs, all to numb out the pain. I stand and bang my head against the wall to the point of blood, given myself multiple black-eyes from punching myself in the face. Everyday I beat myself up (mentally) to the point where its almost become sadomasochistic. I never thought this day would actually come... I never thought this day would actually come, I have planned this as more of a fantasy for years on this specific date. Now it is finally getting real, 6 months away.... right after I graduate. There is no solution for me.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for listening to the vent. There us none I hate more than myself...",1
"I am so tired of everything, I have not seen a psychologist or a psychiatric in months (they never call me back but oh well), I hate the fact that my psychologist sent me to a psych ward again two months ago. I have given up on getting better honestly. I am not saying I am going to kill myself just yet, but it would not be the first (or second, or third, or fourth...) time I have tried to. I do not care if MAYBE things get better, I just do not know how long I can hold on. I have got my bf and my best friend (and only friend tbh) who are supporting as best as they can, but it is so hard. I cannot keep having these damn hallucinations and voices CONSTANTLY but whenever I tell my psychologist, she just tells me it is part of my anxiety and depression. From what I mentioned on an ALT account a while back, people seem to think that Schizophrenia is the most likely thing. I have pretty much lost touch with reality, I genuinely do not know what is real and what is fake anymore. All my meds are useless and I always feel like trash. I just wish I was not born, or I was born normal like everyone says. My dad hates me, my mum does not understand me and my sister just tells me to off myself already and stop wasting everyone is time. I am starting to see that that is my only option. Why so I have to keep suffering? Why cannot I just die already? But no, I cannot. I have to act like everything is okay, like I am fine. I can find comfort in my bf and best friend, my favorite videogames, horror movies, musicals and drawings. they are literally the only things I can 'feel good around'. And to quote the perfect line for my feelings: ""there is nothing for me here. I am alone, forsaken, invisible.""-Lydia Deetz. I mean, if I cannot even stop crying, how can I stop myself from dying? I will shut up now, so if you actually read all of this silly rant, thank you. I do not really have much to give, but I can make you a little drawing if you would like. I imagine you are going through a lot too, and I hope things get better. I will not lie to you, I cannot guarantee it, but I am here if you just want someone to listen.

"I do not think it matters what I do but I will never matter to anyone. All I am good for is to pay bills and work... My spouse took me to this place he would been raving about, he had taken my daughter a few weeks back. We went and he acted nervous or like he was waiting for someone or maybe he was just embarrassed to be seen with me. Thinking back he walked behind me or not near me the entire time. Then yesterday while I was working he went back again. What bothers me more is he, who does not even like Chinese, kept pushing how he would go there to get ME food. I was not asking for it, I did not care what food was purchased. I felt manipulated but also was in the middle of work an it did not seem like the time to pry. I do not want to stop him from being happy either. It feels very manipulative to me. When he came back he was happy an ate and went back to sleep. He spent the rest of the evening on his phone till I went to sleep then ""had trouble sleeping"" and stayed up all night. This has become a cycle, apparently he only gets good sleep when I am awake. I keep thinking he is going to leave since last fall. Everyday I am prepared for him to tell me how he does not love me, that he never did. Every time he takes me somewhere public, as I push my cart I think is now when he is going to drop the ""It is whatever you want"" statement with 'because I am leaving you"". He has started saying the it is whatever you want,, what makes you happy, ect. These phrases combined with the fact that he will not even come near me. I have been here before... I am trying to get more hours at work and you know accept it. He looks disgusted when he looks at me, he does not want to be anywhere near me and there is no amount of putting lipstick on this pig to change it. My parents could not love me. My grandparents could not. How could anyone else want me in their life? I am just not good enough for anyone. I Will Never Be Good Enough",0

I just feel that I am not good enough for this sociaty and world...Sorry if my english is bad. Native Finnish I was just walking through a forest looking to kill myself.",1
"This is something I wished I realized last month and the month before that when I was suicidal because of my insensitive ex. I cannot believe I was ""Wondering if they would even care if I was dead"" or ""Be indifferent when they got the news"". How fucked up is it to be fixated on someone who is so insensitive, callous, nonchalant, blame shifting, cruel and dismissive towards your feelings that you do not know if they would even care if you were dead. How messed up is it to be in love with someone who makes you wonder about that. Yet when you disprove their statements they play the suicide card. They treat you horribly then wonder why you react with the same cold, distant energy they pushed you away with. Perpetual victims will always be perpetual victims. Forget that trash. If they are insensitive to your feelings they will not care if you are dead.",0
I am consumed with my own issues. I lean on others too hard and I hold them to very high expectations that they never reach. I am inconsiderate. I am unkind. I lack empathy. I am always in need.

This false person reads books, she hung out with friends last weekend, she cares about fitness and family. Not a single person on earth knows how deeply deceitful I am. Some figure out bits and pieces, but if they learned the whole picture, they would never forgive me.I feel like if someone judges me for something fake, I can deal with the pain of rejection because it is not truly connected to me.

"This is going to be an odd post but i want all the knowledge and expertise I can get.KindlyI know my phone is hacked and I want to prove it.The person who has hacked my phone is another tenant in the house.they are bullying me and sharing and spreading rumours about me in the city.I will provide context(Third World Country(Large House)):The other tenants(Buisness) can see everything on my phone screen before you say this a classic tech noob post.I was watching explicit content(weird stuff) and two of the other tenants came to the adjacent rooms window facing mine and said look at what this dude is watching.This is not enough proof.My phone just glitched this morning and started google chrome opened itself and searched by itself why the phone was glitching.The screenshot '2021' was saved to my device while it was glitching.(It has happened before)Back to my earlier point the reason i know they know I watch explicit content is because they have spread rumours about me being a pervert and gay.I also overheard a conversation where one of the other tenants was on the phone with what to have been a hacker.The man asked :What is that app on his phone?He said it is an app used to go to sleep.Guess which app I have?A white noise app.I know it is not enough to go on(anecdotal evidence) but I feel it in my bones and gut.I swear being in the situation would only make you see it as I do.I have really considered the mental aspect but I know the signs are too hard to ignore.Why not just buy a new phone?I want to catch the people spying on me and watching my phone.Even this post is possibly to them.Before you ridicule me,I know it sounds like paranoia,I am just one kid(18) and they are a group of people(the other tenants)who are too nosy for their own good.Is this possible or am I just paranoid? No one believes me even though I am dead sure it is true.Why cannot they just mind their own buisness?",1

His tinder matches literally beg him to fuck them while I have been on multiple apps for 5 years and barely get anything. He did not do anything wrong and hes trying to help me get over my depression but i just fucking resent him so much. I know that I would instantly feel so much better if 1 girl showed interest in me. He said hell keep helping me even though I keep pushing him away but I think hell stop soon with how I am treating him. Resenting my only friend,0

During the day I play a functioning human, during the night I suffocate in self loathing, self harm urges and suicidal fantasies.When I laugh or talk about whatever, it is only superficial. It does not really stimulate my brain, my emotions are only shallow and short living. I feel like I am just playing roles while being completely empty inside.",0

"[16F] Why do I have to be so young and suffer with depression and anxiety? I have been to counseling when I was 14 and that never helped and now I am diagnosed with bipolar which I feel like I am really not. I am on this stupid medication that makes me feel numb. I try to talk to my mom or my therapist and they tell me to stay on the meds because they are helping, but I feel like they are making me feel worse. I honestly feel like no one understands me. I feel like I cannot express how I truly feel because I fear being diagnosed with some even more serious mental illness. Its so depressing to know I have to deal with a mental illness for the rest of my life at such a young age. I feel so stuck. I do not have that much of a social life and I feel unmotivated to try to. I do not even have a bad home life yet I feel so alone. I do not look forward to my future at all and do not even know what I want to do with my life. I hate expectations that society puts on people my age. I have all As grades for this school year because I do want to graduate and maybe go to college, but I do not know what I want out of life. I honestly hate school even though I succeed. I am feel more happy with things that do not require a lot of school, but I know that they will never be long term success and Ill never be successful in life without a degree in something that I hate.

I want it to be quick, jumping off my roof will take too long and I will panic on the way down, it needs to be something I can do fast and will not have time for second thoughts like when I tried to slit my wrist.I know my therapist said that this is ""eternity thinking"" but that is just an iteration of ""oh dark times come and go, you will feel better soon"" THE FUCK I WILL, HAPPINESS IS TEMPORARY AND I WANT TO FUCKING DIE.there is no fucking point in anything if I cannot change this, it is just something that comes over me and suddenly I realise I do not want to do anything apart from dieI think I need anti depressants, maybe then I would not be in fucking pain all the timeThe problem is I can hide it really well in front of the people who are there to help, and I do, as a defence mechanism, I see my best friends and they are like, are you okay, and I convince them that yeah I am fine and they have bigger things to worry about so they accept it but every day I am in fucking painI want to feel something different, either things need to change now or I need to die End me",1

"I do not know when or why I started feeling like a burden to everyone around me but one day I just shut down and stopped talking to everyone. No one ever reached out. 8 years went by in total silence. Everyday I think I about ending it. Day by day pieces of me die. I hardly smile. Most days I do not even speak. I think there is no way I make it to 40.... 5 more years of silence have gone by. I am now almost 31 and Its occurred to me that I might actually make it to 40 at this rate.I stopped talking to my father when I was like 14-15. His new wife had 2 kids and I guess I felt left out or not loved. Who knows. My dad however had no problem letting me move in with my mom. Despite the fact she had no housing and lived with friends/boyfriends. Brother and sister stayed with dad. As you can imagine. Life was not good. At 16 my dad rented an apartment for my mom and me. She moved in with her boyfriend and I lived alone. No one to tell me to go to school or brush teeth. Most nights I went to bed hungry. At 17 I lived in my dads office for about 3 months before he rented another apartment for me to live in. I Dropped out of high school as a sophomore and got my G.e.d.....no job, no friends. Just me in an apartment with no furniture. I took the lease over at 18. No idea how to prepare for the future.I thought it was cool at the time but the problem is, life moves on....Now here I am, alive, wishing it was over. I wasted 10 years of my life alone, feeling sorry for myself. I did not save any money. I do not even know what a 401k is. None of these things mattered to me, because I thought I was going to end it. and In that time, my moms health severally declined. She was my best friend. The only one I could talk to. Now we cannot even have a conversation. She just stares blankly with no expression. I probably do not have much longer with her. My dad is living his best life. Brother and sister, the whole family looks happy. All I feel is regret. I have no one. I need help, but why would they want to help me? The burden back from the dead, here to make my problems yours. I do not want that. I do not want to die. I desperately want to better myself, but I do not think I can do this alone. I did not think Id make it this long. Now I am full of regret.",1

The only pleasure I experienced was physical --- basically massages and orgasms -- but even those do not feel as pleasurable as they used to.I think I have a mental illness in which my brain puts itself in a constant state of emotional distress. I have been getting medical and therapeutic intervention for over 10 years but my condition has never improved. In fact it is been on a gradual, steady decline.Yet I am still here for some reason.

"Hi guys, So I have been struggling with depression and PTSD since my father became an alcoholic. I had a pretty nice childhood, up until my dad got addicted and my mom got breastcancer twice. Luckily, she survived. My dad was a top banker, very successful, but his addiction got the best of him. He did absolutely horrible things. &amp;#x200B;So when I started my student time, I got really depressed. I could not make choices. I lived at home, being deeply depressed, whilst all of my friends moved out and I felt like I was so late with that. My friends convinced me to move in with them, but I said no, and now I regret that. Eventually I moved out and I had a good time, but I feel like I could have made so much more of my student time. And I did not do that. I know it was because I was struggling with PTSD, but I just do not understand myself and I feel like I have lost myself years ago, due to my traumatic childhood. &amp;#x200B;Apart from that, I told a lot of people the bad things my dad did, but I now also see that he is a good man. For some reason, I want to go back and tell people how good of a man he is and what he has achieved in his life- apart from his alcoholism. But I feel like people do not really care and this has more to do with my own process of moving on? &amp;#x200B;Anyways, I hope there is someone that can help me with some comforting words! Conclusion, I feel like I missed out on my most fun years due to depression. The past and my choices keep haunting me.",0

"So recently, I have been having thoughts of death. Even though I have a great life (many friends, great parents, stable family, good income etc...), school has been taking a toll on me and has been putting stress on my parents. Now I do not want to die because of school, but I just kind of do not want to live with the pressure of an adult life. You see, I have no Idea what I want to do in the future and this has been stressing me since most people around me have already started in their career paths. I am way to afraid to commit suicide, but yesterday, without questioning, i just thought: ""what if a car just ran me over or a lightning struck me or something and I died, I will not ever have to grow up and deal with all this bullshit"". I hate school so much. Everyday i drag myself out of bed to commit to class fr 7 hours a day with mostly people and teachers i despise.

"Just turned 22, you.S male.So I have really bad c-PTSD. Tons of bullying by male peers and teachers, physical abuse at school and serious bloody batterings at home, psychological abuse, bad relationship between parents that cultivated in an absent father and a drug-addicted mother that either overdosed or killed herself in front of me naked, sexually, physically and mentally abusive 4-year relationship with an older girl, workplace bullying, sexual harassment at concerts, abusive HS principal (suspended me constantly for no reason, dragged me out of class etc.), social ostracization, etc.there is all that, but last year I was $exually assaulted by a friend of 10 years. Afterwards I tried to engage in a playfight because she was angry drunk and no one asked if I was ok and I wanted to lighten the mood. One of her defenders said ""she beat the shit out of you"" verbatim. She punched me in the face like 5 times, left a ton of huge bruises and sprained my elbow. it is on film. After that happened, I blacked out on alcohol for the first time ever. Afterwards I received serious abuse and harassment. People I did not even know were messaging me calling me a psychopath, a liar, someone told me ""if you keep falsely accusing her you will end up in jail and actually get $exually assaulted"" after implying I drove my mother to suicide. it is been going on for a year now, the girl also falsely accused me of r@pe to get out of the situation. Her friends and my at the time friends were sick people. she is popular and clearly I am a doormat and the abuse and gaslighting and event itself just made me lose my fucking marbles for about a year straight and I was in a constant paranoid drunken state. I guess this was just the tipping point for me. I could not handle it and I just lost it and never slept or cleaned my room and quit my job and attempted $uicide.How do I get out of this place?

I talk to therapists but they give up on me because I am not willing to make any change. I take these meds I do not even know if they help anymore. They want to put me in a hospital to try harder meds. I feel like I am a vegetable, there is no live left in me, everyday is boring, numb and the same.

"I have always struggled with depression. Started freshman year of high school (2010) and its been getting worse ever since. Some months are perfecting fine, but when a wave of it would hit and I am crying myself to sleep or just staring at my phone. 11 years of this and the only reason I am still going is because of my dog. Only a few more years....I saw a ""it is get better post"" on Facebook when I was in high school. This women made a post talking about how she struggled in high school but now she is 25 and happy with a family. Well, I am 26, and I have no family. Just my dog. Originally thought it was my best friend and her family but after living them with 2 years, I realized I am at the bottom of the totem pole. ""If everyone is the problem maybe it is you.""

And I acknowledged what I did wrong, said that their feelings were valid, apologized and even said what I was going to do to change. I put everything out there. I then asked what one of my friends would do to change and she said she needed to think on it. Fine, whatever. Then she told me and my other friend that she could not handle having the conversation and needed to think more and even went as far as only talking about how only her feelings mattered. I then learned that someone who I really cared about decided to just drop me out of the blue. I knew that we were not talking for a while. And I was trying to think of a way to talk with this person without making them upset. But they just do not want anything to do with me. All this just makes me want to not be around anymore.

"Recently diagnosed with borderline. I am 30 and it is gotten to a point where I have one friend, who lives in another city (and I cannot visit easily bcz I do not drive). The rest of the folks who were in my life either were part of a blowout with me or avoid spending time with me (I tend to talk about deeply personal things or am very quiet and awkward, so I do not even blame ppl for not wanting to be around me. Pls note: I do try to monitor my behavior and comments and try not to say inappropriate things that make folks uncomfy but it is sometimes done unconsciously.) I have spent most of my life telling myself it is all in my head, people do not dislike me, I just need to be more social yadayadayada. Which is not necessarily untrue, but now I am realizing that it is more like people do not feel a connection with me therefore they likely never even think or care to consider spending time with me or talking to me. (Ie. it is not all about me realization). Currently I am stuck between fearing connection (potential rejection) and desperately wanting to spend time with other humans. So I guess my question is: Are there other folks who have experienced this illness or these feelings and have successfully overcame them and were able to build and maintain successful platonic and romantic relationships? If so any tips or advice? Folks with borderline personality: How do you make and maintain friendships?",0

I have to say my happiness gone my mind is numb. I have suffered with physical pain with my spine and dental problems. I have trouble eating swallowing things does not work. I am waiting on an operation. I am totally aware of how this should not be the case when I have so much good around me. I am so grateful for the effort that has been spent on trying to give me a boost into living in this society. I have a holiday booked and still just do not have hope.

"28M.It has been a long time since I have felt down in the dumps, not wanting to do anything, dreading the moment my alarm wakes me up...I cannot say that my life is terrible, I have a job , a flat, ,I am physically healthy and even if they live far away, I have a couple of friends with whom I speak sometimes, but they are the only people outside of work I talk to.However, I hate everything that I have done for the past 14 years, I regret all the opportunities that I have missed, they spin in my head everytime I close my eyes, I hate having to watch myself in a mirror as I know I be the only one who cares anyway.I hate the man that I have become.Lately, I have been thinking about ending my life, not having to wake up, to fake smiling to the few people I get to see, and this is the only moment when I genuinely feel some kind of the weirdest happiness. The thought of not having to wake up makes me happy",1

I just bought a helium tank and everything I need. It was exhausting going out so I do not want to do the deed yet. I want to do it when I am feeling good enough to do it probably. The helium tank in in the back of my car so hopefully my friends will not look in there. I also put the other things in there. I hope they will not ask me to drive anywhere soon. I will probably do it tomorrow. If they found me out that would be fucked. I also want to be sure of my friends work shifts that day and how long they will be gone. I do not want to do it now and one of them pull up. So yeah if everything goes well I will be free. Going to die soon.,1

"Writing this down as I comtemplate if I should kill myself later. I am a 21 year old dude and I am writing this down just to express myself and just for the sake of distracting myself from this thoughts. i have been having this dark thoughts every now and then, but they have been the only thing I only ever think about for the past few days. There are times when I actually think of doing the deed and when should I do it. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of my mom sobbing uncontrollably as they lower my grave down. Its just so hard to keep on going when you literally have no motivation to just keep on living. The only person that I can turn to is my mom, since she is the only person who actually givesa shit about me, everyone else just does not care or they pretend to care and then they talk shit behind my back.I just burst into tears as I am writing this down. I actually never had considered the fact that I would kept this shit inside for so long and and now that its out in the open everything just burst out. I have been trying out the hobbies that my mom's been suggesting but they only provide temprorary relief.To be completely honest, writing down the stuff I have been feeling has helped a bit. I never thought I would use Reddit like this, but I had to let it out somehow.

"Not sure what to do. I will go in alone, stay alone, come home alone, never touched, nothing changes. there is a wall around me no matter where I go, so I really should die. I am ugly, mentally fucked up, absolutely useless, and no one will ever want me again. Every day, every minute, excruciating loneliness. Death is horrifying but the thoughts will not stop. No one will touch me and I have to die.Only problem is I do not want the hospital messing with my Suboxone. they are abusive, and I take a small dose because I am sensitive to it. 2 mg would kill me. They will not allow me to take my dose, and I will go into withdrawal, or they will make me take a whole strip and torture me. I do not need chemical abuse on top of my problems, and that is exactly what they will do. They will not do anything to help because they cannot. No matter where I go, no one will want me, so I have to die but I cannot. I am going insane. But I cannot take anti-psychotics because I still have damage from the last ones years ago. Antidepressants do not work. ECT does not work and I still have brain damage from that. I cannot stay alive and I cannot die. I do not know what to do.

"One of the things I find most offensive about what people say about our music is when they say 'its depressing'. The reason I find it offensive is that..... to me that implies that to suffer from depression is like being..... subnormal..... it is a stigma, which it should not be, because there is an awful lot of people who suffer from depression. And it shoild be something that is like an ultimate swear word, because..... I suffer from it and a lot of people suffer from it. It should be something that is openly discussed and accepted. I happen to make music sometimes when I am in that frame of mind because I suffer from it. Actually sometimes it is not suffering, its a bonus..... because a lot of creative power is from that feeling. Thom Yorke On People Calling Radiohead's Music Depressing",0

I am lucky enough to have friends that pull me out of the house or get me into parties, but I probably never in my life went out with anyone by my own will. Depression eats me and I allow it.

Its been a recurring thought throughout my life. I have come to the final conclusion that its long past due. I am sorry to all the people I hurt.

"I met my ex-wife when I was 19 and after 3 months she insisted that we get married. Obvious red flag, and I knew that then, but I had extremely low self esteem and thought it was a miracle that anybody would be interested in me in the first place.I thought that if I said no, Id lose her and be alone the rest of my life so I agreed. Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story short(ish), naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs, got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife, watched her nearly die due to OD, wandered several states homeless, and got constantly reminded that she did not love me, but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born, she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life, but there was no way in hell I could do that, especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born, so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious, so during the divorce/custody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun, saying I was physically/sexually abusive, a pedophile, that I trafficked her, etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit, but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times, because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end, she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father (were in a deep red state), and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long, but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily, my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom re-married, had another daughter, then around the time my daughter was 8, she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to who-knows-where.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life, not for myself, but for empathy for my daughter. I have to watch as my daughter now has occasional panic attacks, I have to listen as she occasionally weeps in the other room, and I have to feel guilty as a small hateful part of me is glad that her mom is gone and cannot spread anymore poison. I try to suppress that part and I feel like a terrible person because of it.tl;dr Married a deeply troubled person who killed herself and I have mixed feelings about it. My ex-wife, mother of my daughter, killed herself.",0
"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t",0

I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit. Maybe I just do not belong in health care and its a mistake going to nursing school. that is all I know how to do and I cannot even do things right.

"I really need to vent. I need somewhere to let this out. Forgive me if I ramble. it is been hard to focus. Today has been especially difficult. I woke up and I have been laying in bed with my lights off most of the day.. close to a year and a half ago I lost both of my children because I was unfit.. my mental health as well as having ended up in a relationship that nearly cost me my life.. several times. I felt trapped and lost everything before I could get myself together enough to get out.. now I am 25 back at my mother's house and only seeing my girls once a week for an hour.. the other day when planning my weekly visit, their father texted me that I would be unable to see them this week because they were in a wreck and totaled the truck.. he said the girls were fine but he could not even call me.. it made me realize that I was so far gone that he could not even be bothered to tell me that our children were involved in a car wreck.. Today I suppose it all finally settled in. Anytime I would exit my room for anything my mother would put me on the spot in front of everyone. ""I am fine"" I would say. To which her response was always something snarky followed by ""well you do not look fine"". I do not like when people point it out when I am like this.. it makes me feel small.. my voice is never heard because ""someone always has it worse"". I agree, but that does not mean I am not in pain.. so I closed myself off and began to sob again... my step dad, who I have never really bonded with, came into my room and allowed me to talk.. then he spoke. Shared some information that he had not even shared with my mom about his past and his mental health struggles.. it was nice. Then my mom came in upset because he did not tell her where he was going.. began to joke and play around like everything was fine. He had to tell her that this conversation was not about HER.. she took that as a joke also.. she expressed that her and my grandfather had been discussing therapy and medication options for me. Which I am opposed to and she is aware. I can function like a normal person.. I just have my days where I cannot hold it in anymore.. When my step dad left I had to endure being her personal therapist because she ""had the blahs"" and ""I am not the only one that suffers"".. I need encouragement.. I just need hope.. something.

I understand it is something that is possible with all medication, but I am really scared of taking this - I did not feel that way about my previous meds like citalopram. Is there something wrong with my thinking? Has anyone taken this and seen positive effects? Afraid to take medication",0
"This my SECOND attempt in a month and failed again.Same as the last time. Nausea, vomiting, shaking, then pass out. I do not have the balls to do it even though I know it is much better to do it instead of living.I told my friends about one of my biggest secrets so hopefully I do it this time. But here I am, nothing but a pussy and a failure.My biggest wish is someone killing me, or dying in my sleep somehow.90% of my day is just staring at the ceiling, exhausted mentally and physically.Even when I try to sleep I have some nightmares. Either flashback to my attempt, or me and people I love dying.When will this end. I do not know if I will ever do it and finish it all.I am sorry to admit, but I feel jealous and proud at the same time of people committing suicide. I think they are one of the bravest people out there. I cannot. I just cannot do it",1
"I have suffered from chronic depression caked with anxiety for my whole life. it is an inherited thing, so no getting rid of it. Maybe I will not have kids, but I try to look at my life as a gift with an obstacle. When people do not know you have depression it is like they feel the need to point out everything that is wrong with you, and when you are happy you do not understand how important that is to you.it is so hard for me to find something that lifts me, but I have realized that there are things that exist for each and every person that feel like a calm bubble of air after drowning for what feels like an eternity. it is hard for other people to understand why I get so happy over things like this, even my friends who suffer with the same thing as me, but I am so happy because for a short moment I get to experience joy and I want to savor it and feel the breeze of relaxation on my nerves. The thing that cheers me up the most is music. If life were perfect everyone would be kings and queens and everyone would be allowed to dance and have fun while listening to it all. I cannot speak for everyone but I can say that this gleam of light has made me feel so much better about life. Maybe some of you guys who suffer with depression can think about something that makes you guys happy and try to make the most of it from now on.For those of you who feel like me, what things lift you up and make you happy? I appreciate everything that makes me happy",0
"I have been suicidal sense 2017 and as of today I cannot fight it anymore. I had a good life and I happened to develop Borderline Personality Disorder, and Bipolar which have been draining my life away ever sense. I have lost every single person I called a friend. My wife left me a few months for being unstable and a moron and now hates me. Entrepreneur and my instability after divorce made me loose all my business I had and now living at my parents house fearing I am just a failure. I have tried to make friends and make amends with my wife but I just cannot.

"The best option I have available to me is a shotgun to the face or chest; I prefer the latter b/c the idea of going out suddenly is somehow scarier than whatever pain and rapid deterioration to death would come from birdshot to the heart. B/c of the length of the barrel I cannot pull the trigger normally; I have to tie a sash to each foot, looped through the trigger guard, and kick with one foot. That way I could fit the end of the barrel into my mouth or my chest.The last time I got close, but my nerves fell apart after I would done everything but take the safety off. I put it away instead and cried for the first time in a long time, but only briefly. Today I had my second chance (I only have the opportunity when I am alone in the house). I set myself up better (a little bit of forethought led to comforters and pillows being laid down and wrapped around my body to absorb at least some of the blood) and got down to properly loading the thing and taking the safety off. My heart was pounding as it was last time, and my kicking foot started to shake. I put the safety back on, tried to calm down, took it off again, and still could not manage to fire the thing. I ended up untying my feet and putting the gun away. As I sit here typing this the pillows and sheets are still set up next to my bed where I would been sitting, and I am waiting in line for the Suicide Lifeline chat b/c I have never done it before and as useless as I have heard it is, it probably cannot hurt.

People like me have suicidal thoughts frequently if not every single day. No one puts enough effort into preventing suicide. I have called the hotline before and honestly they left me helpless after the 10 minute minimum each call was up. I am broken myself but I would do anything to make a fucking difference. You want to show you care then start with actually caring. This world is filled with selfish people. We should care for each other. They can do MORE to help. All you have to do is fucking care. Just be there. I am going to start my own organization to help prevent suicide because I do not want others that feel as I do to act on it. I feel so damn empty but i refuse to leave without helping others it is NOT Enough!!,1
the way my parents handle my emotions is if I am doing poorly they punish me which makes me do even worse so i have to wade through shit until i can at least present like I am doing well to them so they will treat me well and they currently think I am doing 100% fine and I am scared my doctor will see the wounds on my stomach and chest and will tell them or admit me to a ward and yeah fuck what do i do? can i just tell the doctor i do not want to lift up my shirt? could i just beg them to not tell my parents? do i make some shit up about a cat or whatever idk what to do loelelel help (self harm TW) i relapsed into self harm yesterday and am coincidentally getting a doctor check up tomorrow and i do not know what to do help,0

Recently I self sabotaged with a girl and we broke things off she was not interested in being with someone who needed reassurance bc of her ex and I get that. I have a job I hate so much I am mistreated and I am uncomfortable I work as a maintenance worker bc I have no real skills and at my job I just feel so unhappy and joyless. My home life I feel like I am ignored or I am a background character I do not feel like I matter I never did but lately its been really damaging. I push away friends bc they want to help and I know what I should do but its the same issue with the girl I am always looking for reassurance. I am at a point now where I am asking myself should I go on antidepressants?? Does it even matter ? Idk if life will ever get better or if Ill ever be happy so I am now considering suicide as it might be my only option and it might be the answer I ask myself should I kill myself? Maybe the afterlife is this perfect paradise no bullshit its a perfect place where nothing goes wrong .its worth the shot I think its time and I do not think there is any other option I think I am going to call out of work tomorrow and end it I am 95% sure Ill go through with it I think its my time I cannot go on and I do not want to I do not know if it gets better,1

Why are you such a fucking wimp? Why?I normally end up screaming internally inside my bed. I used to cry myself to sleep, but now there are not any tears left. I sing myself songs of my childhood.

"30 days from now I will be 16. It feels surreal to be honest. My entire life up to this point has just been a disappointing miserable mush of trauma and the desire to let it end already. In all honesty its been like this all my life. For almost as long as I can remember, slowly becoming more and more obvious as time went on. Life does not feel real, just a lump of memories, few good, mostly bad and a dream like feeling. Like there is not someone in there, just a she will of what a human ought to be. One of my first memories is being six and looking in the mirror and hating how I did not ""look and act like a person"" and comparing myself to my classmates. They looked like people. They acted like people. I did not feel like one. It terrified me back then that I was going to be an adult, probably because of how different a child and an adults responsibilities were. I remember being nine, and being petrified that I was halfway to becoming an adult. I want to go back to that state. I am scared. Scared of turning 18. When I was 12 and the awful became worse I promised myself I would kill myself at 16 if things did not get better. Shortly after that I changed it to 18, maybe its because that back part of my brain was a coward, but I convinced my self it was because my family would have to see my body. My disgusting ugly self with an equally atrocious brain. And here I am, almost approaching the age that has scared me all my life. 760 days until I am 18. I truly do not ever think I will escape this depressing mindset I locked myself into so young. I am empty, I am emotionally drained and ready to go missing for weeks before my body is finally discovered decaying in some forest. I do not know how I will die. I do not know if ill be able to kill myself on the exact day I turn 18. Not that it would matter. Nobody would care if I died. My parents certainly would not, they are the ones who watered this miserable seed of,,whatever this is in my head. They do not even leave their rooms anymore. Not that I care. Being around them any longer then humanly necessarily would just make me feel worse. My life honestly feels so wasted. I can barely eat something without feeling like I am going to vomit. Its this constant sense of nausea. Why did I have to be born into this body? Why this brain? Why do I feel like I am watching a car crash behind a foggy windshield everyday? what is wrong with me? Can a truck just crash threw my house and kill me lol. I wish I did not get up when I tripped that one time while I crossed the street when I was younger. Face smashed in with no chance of living, and I get seen as this tragic death of a young girl and my parents and classmates might have actually pretended to like me for a week or two. Oh well.Sorry for this, I do not know why my brain is being so bad in particular. Maybe its the insomnia talking. Most days I can suck it up and just keep it in my head, or write a little two paragraph vent that scratches the surface of my stupid idiotic thoughts. But hey, pitbulls been there done that so maybe I am just much more weak willed then I put on. Thanks for listening, lol. The Final Chapter of my life has begun.",1

I have a full time Job. Married. Two dogs. No debt and I am turning 25 in a few months. I graduated with my bachelors is psychology. I help people with chronic mental illness and homelessness and take so much abuse from them its not even funny. I am resentful about how my employers pay me I am currently making 44k a year and I am trying to further my education but I keep getting denied into masters programs. Getting paid that much at 24 years old makes me feel like I have failed right out of the gate. I budgeted like a mad man and was able to save about 40k for a down payment for a house. But the market is so insane that we cannot even come close to the offers. I feel like I have done all of that budgeting for nothing.. I spent 19 years of my life being a devoted Christian believing every word and building my faith. My degree in psychology showed me that my faith was incorrect and taught me to look for evidence in what I believe. I feel so isolated because my wife still believes along with nearly all of my friends. My wife knows and she has been very supportive. My parents keep asking me when I am getting a new job.I applied for a new one I was accepted but they wanted to pay me around 15 percent LESS than I am making now. I am starting to drink and get high nearly everyday and I have picked up a porn addiction that I thought I got rid of. Resentment towards my wife because I feel like I get rejected atleast 3-4 times a week for sex. And now I am starting to blow my money that I worked hard for on nothing.. Idk I have pretty much everything going for me and I know I should be thankful I just keep getting caught in this route of wanting perfection and I keep comparing myself to others. I have had thoughts of suicide and since working in mental health I feel like I have lost faith in the system to reach out or to even talk to a therapist. Which is what I want to be.I could never leave my wife or family like that. But man I am just really not enjoying life right now. I hope some day that I will. Last thing I want to be is a victim. I am just not happy. Really needed to get this out. My life is perfect but I am miserable,0

"I have had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember and from last year it is been really bad. Now this year is just pushing me over the edge. First my grandpa died then my dad got so sick he could have died and needed an emergency operation and he will need one more in a few months. Then my cat got really sick and she is still sick and I am trying so hard to get her better but I am failing. Then an animal at work that I have been really close to died while under my care. I have a partner but no friends and animals are my heart and soul. People generally repulse me. So, people might think that pet problems would not effect someone very much, but for me it totally stops my life and takes me over.The anxiety about my dad being OK is just on my mind constantly and the fact that the animal at work died under my care makes me feel so horrible and useless, I could not save him.. what the he will am I even there for then? And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead. I would give my life for her wellbeing if it was only possible to make the trade. I have not slept in 4 nights because I have been watching over her. And now awaits another sleepless night. And then tomorrow I have to go to work and it is killing me because ill have to leave my cat and I will not be able to watch her and I will just be a ball of anxiety while somehow working.My partner tries to be supportive but she does not really understand and when she jokes and smiles I just feel so alone.The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is how much it would hurt my parents and that I would fail my cat, she would not understand where her mommy went and then she would have to move and get a new mommy and I am responsible for her. But I am starting to feel like I am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worrying.Everytime I am driving I am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to. I cannot take this any more. The constant sadness, hopelessness, worrying and fear This year has been hell and I just want to leave",1

"When I was younger, I was always told that suicide was a cowardly decision. At first, it shot through my heart because it made me feel bad for feeling bad, but now I just scoff at that idea. it is not a cowardly decision. If it was a cowardly decision, then I would be dead. I am a huge pussy and every time I get close to making a suicide attempt wheater it is me about to kick the chair with a rope around my neck or not swallowing a fist full of pills, I end up hesitating, wussing out, and not going through.it is like my body pulls me back when I try and it is so taxing when your mind wants you dead and your body does not cooperate. I know this cannot be an unfamiliar occurrence because our bodies do everything they can to make us live. Sure I have attempted a couple of times by hanging, but that was only because I slipped and the rope and fixture broke.If I had a gun, then I could just take a breath, count to ten, and take the pain away but I do not. Even then I probably would not even be able to put the gun in my head or mouth anyways. Maybe one day I will stop being a pussy and do it, but not tonight. If suicide is a cowardly decision then why am I still here?",1
And Id like to feel like I am not alone being 30 and constantly thinking about it. Are you guys out there?! I see a lot of teens talk about suicide,1
"Every day I think ""I should kill myself"" and every day I am right. I am miserable all day every day. It is exhausting, I am so fucking tired of living a life I do not even want to live. Everyone I care about is dead, all I have is the festering feeling in my chest where there was once love and caring. I once wanted to fix this world, now I just want it to burn. Why do I continue this bullshit? Unrealistic hope that one day it gets better? The more realistic hope I will become worse of a person that can replace love with the catharsis after a rampage? Too bad no one knows me enough to know what goes through my head in a given day. Maybe someone would appreciate my fortitude, it is not easy to stay alive, but there is a .38 here that would make it real easy to be dead. Just another generic rant.",0

"Its my birthday today.. technically yesterday now since time keeps fucking going. I never wanted to or thought Id make it this far, yet here I am. You can no longer use the teenager excuse lol. that is the first thing my mom said to me. she is talking about me being 20 now with no sort of education, no drive or anything to say I am a functional human being with a future. I already knew today would feel lonely and empty, but I did not expect to be so alone. My partner is literally the only person I hoped to see today but nope. Ill see him tomorrow maybe, but I did not want to feel alone today. I wanted to have one day for myself that would make this next year less taunting. I wanted to feel special and not loathe myself for one day. Its funny when I think I can set high expectations. This is just an intoxicated inspired vent. No one could truly know what is in my head unless they have stepped inside, so any outside input means very little. I am just still here and still waiting to feel better. I am still that sad kid who woke up so confused after attempting, why did not it work? Will it work if I try again? because next year will start a worse chapter if my story keeps going. happy birthday to me",1
"Anyone experience with hydromorfine ? I ordered o box of 30 pills , in total 480 and mixing with 240 mg of Xanax Would that dose be enough for a lethal dose ? No jokes or hate , please suicide",1
I am not sure why I am saying this or what to expect from it I just truly cannot believe it to be true. I confided to my mother 9 days ago that I was contemplating suicide. And she still has yet to even mention it or ask if I am ok,1
"My bf and I have been together for several months now. He told me about his depression pretty early on, but he had been doing well overall for quite a while. Well, over the last few weeks he has started having symptoms and has been struggling. I am trying my best to be there for him without trying to ""fix"" him. But it is difficult. My question is who is it OK to talk to? Everyone in me life has either met him or will likely meet him at some point so I do not want to talk to someone when he would not want them to know. So where do I turn for support? I know therapy would be ideal, but I do not really have money for that right now. Would appreciate advice. Who do I talk to? (Partner going through depressive episode.)",0
"Basically my friend has been ignoring me for weeks. Then out of nowhere he messaged me and explained to me that I am a shit person and said it was not my fault because its just who I am. The thing is I felt nothing when he said that absolutely nothing. All I feel is boredom and nothing in my life, I find no enjoyment in anything. And my losing my friend and feeling nothing just makes me think I am a shit person. My friend just told me I am shit person.",0
"Recently I have been getting less and less depressed, but for some reason the further I get the more guilt I feel knowing there are people still stuck where I was and it is like I have just left them behind. I know first hand how absolutely horrendous depression can be and yet I cannot do anything about it. And I am scared ill forget what it felt like and end up stuck at square one, or worse yet I will turn into one of those people who just do not understand what it does to people I feel guilty",0
it should be a free option to die in society and i just no should i do it tomorrow? that is the question its no longer if i got the balls to do it it never was it was just an excuse because as a person i was very hopefull and did not yield. will i do it tomorrow damn if i could keep on sprinting tomorrow i would live for another day but i cannot because i trained my legs to much last time and need to rest for 2 days and i cannot wait for that. Please someone in the comments field i need to hear the truth please tell me i am a horrible person please tell me that i live a sad life like many other that is already lived and the best thing i can do now is kill myself please tell i am stupid and i will fail whatever i plan in the future tell me that no girl will love me please I am begging you guys just do this for me say i should kill myself because its for the best i cannot please i beg you say that i have all the reasons to do it please let me die,1

I keep making mistakes. I keep making people miserable. I keep trying to improve but I always end up doing the wrong thing. I have been crying for three hours straight now and constantly thinking about my suicide attempt from 2019. It did not matter how many Xanax I took right now I still cannot sleep and I have to stay aware of how horrible a person I am and how better Id be if I was dead. I cannot self harm because I promised my family I would not. I am stuck. I just do not want to be here I do not know what I want. But I know I deserve death.,1

"For me I do not think therapy actually works for everyone, or of course I would have been better. It is very time consuming and embarrassing, do not come at me with saying embarrassing but I do not feel like I am ever going to trust anyone with what I want to say and who I am. I see therapist online blabbering about their patients and it bugs me! Three years ago my college professor told me to seek therapy, after I almost missed my final because I was too depressed to get out of bed since I was contemplating killing myself a day before that test. I arrived two hours late, my advisor let them allow me to take it.I came because my advisor called me and I felt kind of valuable lol. The professor literally said, after I reached out to ask about my grade you seem like an over-thinker, do not think and just seek therapy. I told a friend of what happened and she said then book a session. I was already in therapy at that time do not you hate when random people be like seek therapy",0

"I am a 26 year old male. Never had a girlfriend, never kissed anyone and a virgin. I do not know what happened really. I basically never asked a girl out properly. Even when a few of them showed interest in me. I even had 2 girls ask me out on their freaking own. I never asked them out myself on a second date. I just do not get it. When I have to do it I get nervous, like I am about murder someone is entire family. Even though it is a completely normal and natural thing to do. I am scared to set up a dating profile too... it is like everyone started dating at 16 and I just got stuck at 12 years old. I feel pathetic for it. The funny thing is all the other aspects of my life is good. I have friends and even ""girl friends"". I have a master's degree and I am building a solid career. I am independent from my parents too... Just this dating aspect of my life is not existent and never was. Most of my friends have girlfriends and boyfriends... Just not me. However as I get older I feel the urge to have kids and a wife. I really want. I think there is nothing more magical then having a strong long marriage with a woman you love and to see your children grow up to be adults. I cannot imagine how happy that would make me. Yet I am not able to do anything to accomplish that. The realization I will never have a wife and kids depresses me more and more as I get older. It will probably eat me alive from within one time. I am writing all this here because suicide has come up in my mind several times and I feel really lonely today in my studio apartment. I want to have a wife and raise a family.",1

If I had better deductive reasoning, another chance. People lie so much, people value money over other people. I will never understand, never. I was wiser when I was younger, everyone kept telling me I was Israelis. I listened to them. Nothing was wrong with me and I realized this, but not deep enough. I ignored my gut that knew.

"TLDR; i tend to isolate and push people around when i got depressed. i want to change that behaviour, so i do not because problem anymore. The final straw is when my academic manager in college say to me that she hate the type of student of me. When i get down, i tend to isolate myself. Always hesitant wether i should reach out and bothering people, or just suck it up because i am worthless anyway. This kind of behaviour because me a lot of troubles and enemys. I done this to my seniors, friends, classmate, bestfriend, even family. There is the time that my classmates drive me into corner and ask, what do i want, because clearly i am in deep trouble, and i am dragging them down. But, i do not know anything. I do not know what i truly want. Some help? More time? Encouragement? Motivation? Some space? Or what. This drive them crazy, and at the same time, make me even more crazy than them that i am bothering them for nothing. that is why i am hesitant to ask help, or report, or just to tell someone. And they tend to avoid me as well. To put it simply, They want to help, but i do not know about what because the problem for me, so i cannot say anything. Sometimes, my brain is in fog, other time i complete clueless. So i want to change this behaviour. But i do not know a thing about it. How it happen? Why? What because it? When, limitation, factors around it, anythings. Can someone tell me about it please, i want to change. How to change to not be an asshole?",0

So I am 17 years old I am also a crippling alcoholic. I was severely abused by my mom's boyfriend as a child and to say it has left a impact on me is a understatement. Ever since he came into my life and thankfully left i have not had one night were i cannot sleep without a nigh terror. Because of that i have very crippling somniphobia i genuinely have the phobia of sleep. I also have zero friends whenever i try to talk with someone they say I am annoying or talk to much. I am very lonely and hate it. I used to be a very happy and caring person i did not think some people could be all evil. I am done trying to help people ever time i do I am manipulated abused and exploited. I feel like a fucking idiot for ever thinking not all people are bad. I am so sick of the world shitting on me. I used to think everyone had some good in them i was wrong. I used to volunteer and help people in need be i have been used and exploited so much I am done. I genuinely am done but I am to afraid to end my life. I was so kind to people i have been told so many times i am the nicest person ever by some people. And what did being kind and caring get me no where but being used exploited for money and abuse. Where did i go worng in my life i have no one to talk to about this. I am 17 a alcoholic and have not slept without nightmares since i was 6.,1

"Hello Reddit, it is a depressing Friday night once again.I just feel like I will not ever find a person right for me. Just because I am weird / different to most, if not all the people I have met. I feel like no one will ever get me. So I do a lot of things that people (at least in my age) would not dare to do. I have a (or so do others say) weird mentality, approach to life, apparently I am a 'free spirit' or whatever. For example, I never cared to conform to any stupid social norms I did not get.Like for example, I never got why people (over here) only apply to schools in their own country. So I applied to universities thousands of kilometres abroad. Or why does everybody think the country they are born in is the 'best' country? I want to see the world and decide for myself what is the best place to live. And I will then live there. Same goes for many other areas of life, like I seem to be the only one ever to find social media mostly useless.Back to the point, sorry: Most people are 'impressed' by this and they say stuff like ""Woah, impressive, I could never!"" but I never actually met someone who would say ""Woah, impressive, hell yes I am in!!"". It just feels very alone and depressing. I am the kind of person who can get a lot of purpose out of another person and I just feel like I will not ever have that. I always wanted to be 'stupid', like my brain not to work so I could just be happy and not think about anything. I wish I was dumb af so I could just fall in love with anybody without worrying about whether we have a real connection. But I just cannot. I feel like no one will ever get me. I feel like I will always have to be alone because I am just too weird for people. Fucking depressing. I feel like I am never going to find a person right for me",0

"I just would like to post here because I know that my feelings are valid, but a product of my own doing. So I come here to vent and relate to others. If I could take all of your pain I would. I just feel empty, like I do not belong in this skin. I am a burden to everyone. I am watching from the sidelines as someone else lives and loves life. In my social circle I am the one people come to, look up to, the shoulder to cry on, the useable one, the ducking doormat to some if you will. BUT I do not see what they see in me at all. I see a worthless girl who is mean a vicious and hard to love. A child whowas never even given an opportunity to show the love she had dwelling inside. My family is absent but not physically. I am not sure why but there is and never has been any emotional stability. Some of my family members are hardcore narcissists.. including my mother I think. It took its toll and determinate my self image but I am glad I have the knowledge now to know that their behaviors do not reflect mine.. I love other people and I love my family dearly, but they serve me no purpose besides the occasional moral support. They would not even know how to handle the things I deal with on a day to day basis that I mask. I hate everything about myself physically and mentally. There is something very wrong with me. I feel so different but I can mimick behaviors so well that no one would ever even have an idea as to why I would even notion suicide. Little do they know, they are the source of a lot of my issues, not all though. In the end, its my choice to feel. Its not their fault its mine for allowing the burden of others to be my own but I do not want to live on living in the midst of despair and the shadow of others however, I always end up here .Here is a place of solitude, loneliness, the despair of myself and others and so much more. All capsized right here. I do not know what to do anymore, my mind never stops and its driving me insane. I wish I did not care like other people, like the people who surround me.

"I really want to die right now. I know I said on my last post here that I was going to OD in like five days from now but I want to escape *now*. The only reason I have not done it yet is because i have not finished my note. So I guess Ill just ramble now.One reason for my urge to die right now is the fact that I have dance practice tomorrow. But its not like I hate dancing, I guess its the fact that I have to be active and that I have to interact with people when I have been trying so hard just to get away from them so my upcoming suicide will not bother them. Another reason is because of my mom. You might be thinking *woah, they sound like they are an annoying, entitled brat*. So let me explain. I have odd and relatively unhealthy eating habits. Its been like this forever. So when my mom suddenly starts asking me what I want to eat more and buys a bunch of food, I find it odd. she is never done this. And I have never thought too much about my eating habits so when she keeps bringing it up, it does not exactly feel nice. I do not know if I have an ED but my mom seems to see it that way. I know that she is just concerned but I do not like feeling smothered. And of course I have not talked to her about this because its kind of taboo in my culture and I am an overall reserved person.

"Although in my last post I mentioned my situation was not that serious, posting it online made me feel better, so I am ready to open up a little more on the mental side of things, instead of the previous more material based one.This is not my suicide note to reddit, rather a way to see if I can put everything into words.I do not know what proper etiquette for suicide notes is but here goes nothing. While taking a walk in a forest, I realized I am at the lowest point in my life. I do not necessarily feel sad, it is hard to put into words. I have sudden urges to randomly cry yet I do not feel ""sad""I do not find any joy in life whatsoever. Every day feels like a chore, simply waking up is painful, as I open my eyes my thoughts start running, thinking of everything that bothers me about life.Dad, I love you. We do not talk much, we are both on the less talkative side but trust me I have never been mad at you and love you to death. you have been an amazing dad and nothing was your fault.Mom, I talk with you a lot more and love you just as much as dad. I can not imagine how you are feeling reading this letter, I do not expect you to understand nor accept this, but have peace in knowing I am happy, do not feel sorry for me, please. I have lots of friends, quite a few good ones even. I have an amazing family, yet I still feel alone somehow.Brother, you have been amazing my entire life, I know we do not spend time together anymore, but from the time we have spent you will always be the best bro.To everyone else, sorry for not naming you, you all have a place in my heart. I simply do not see the point in continuing this misery. As clich as it sounds, it all just feels so pointless. The aforementioned walk in a forest that made me realize all of this, I have never walked there before, yet it felt like a routine. Everything I do feels like a routine, I do not even feel control over myself. It almost feels like I have a certain path that I must follow - one that leads to continuous emptiness.

I am sad too, why do I have to think and care about other people before thinking about me?These people have friends and family who love them.

I think it is so sad. I have become a shut-in and I stopped leaving my house. Nothing gives me happiness anymore and forcing a hobby just does not feel right. I wake up, take some pills, sleep for 6 hours, wake up at night and watch the moon while I await my death. Is accomplishing anything even worth it?",0

"I had to take a sick leave from work because my depression affected my live too much and eventually I lost my work. My psychiatrist just wants to put me in a hospital, already contacted my parents, my therapist does not want to talk to me till I will go to the hospital. I feel so much pressure, I am scared of going here but I feel like everyone is pressuring me and if I do not go they will be angry and give up on me. It may help me but now I am just scared. I do not know how long would I have to be here, who will I meet. If it will even help or I will just run away from my problems. It may be selfish but I do not want to go. I may get worse, everyone may hate me for that. But I do not, sadly I can only say that here because I am scared to do so irl. I may end up in a hospital because of depression but I do not want to",0

"For context, I am 19 years old and I am starting my second year at a community college in August. I want to take a semester off due to an all time low in motivation. Id rather not wasted my parents money and instead spend that time getting a job, seeing a therapist, working out, really just getting better. The problem with telling them I do not want to go this semester is I have to have a good reason and Id rather not lie to them. They know about my anxiety which is hard enough for me to deal with sometimes but them knowing I have depression is a whole other thing. And I know its not as bad as my brain is telling me it is but I cannot help it. I was hoping to get some advice on the matter because if I do not make up my mind soon Ill lose the opportunity to enroll in class if things do not go play out how I think they might. How do I tell my parents I am depressed",0
"I have called the suicide hotline three times in my life. All three of those times, though through no fault of the caller, I have felt less listened to and heard than if I were to just ramble to my friends or internet strangers.'Active/Reflexive listening' is a good tool when people use it correctly, but what I have been met with when calling has been the basic 'I hear _' or 'you sound ___'. Yes, I appreciate your insight, but I do not need to be told my feelings when I want to slit my wrists while listening to my favorite songs as I black out from loss of blood. Does anybody else have this problem of eye-rolling when trying to seek help? I feel so selfish and frustrated at the same time. I have a therapist, but manic depression prevents me from caring about my meetings. I force myself to log on, put on a smile, and try to be insightful about my problems until nobody's eyes are on me again and I can take off my mask of mental health again into the faceless being I seem to be identifying with more and more. I am just so tired of everything. I am tired of human interaction in general. I do not know how to keep my energy as it and most of my positivity ends up jumping ship as soon as it can. I am tired of putting on a strong face and of bottling up all of this overdue crying I do not let myself experience. Once upon a time I would have loved to hear a friendly 'everyone fucks up, it will be okay' but now I do not want to hear anything. I want to lock myself up and stare at the ceiling. I want to impose prison time on myself so that I am less responsible for a life I do not care about. I do not want my corpse to be found. that is the most honest reason for not dying already. My family's reaction. My sister's disappointment when she is dealt with this as well. But, I do just not want to wake up. I want a heat seeking one person disintegration missile comet type thing to just do its thing.I will probably call the hotline tonight and roll my eyes again. Pushing away positive changes as I always do. Ignoring things I do not want to hear. Pretending the past is not the curse tainting any chance at happiness because I was afraid to try. Taking solace in the fact that we all eventually disappear. Meanwhile browsing tiktok lives to get noticed by strangers and attain a slight bit of validation that will end up disappearing in the air like all of those exhales after smoking - anything to numb my head and my body. I want to let myself cry, but I am worried I will never stop at this point. I am alone. Truly. But we all are. Not sure of the point of this post now as the walls of dissociation come back up. Thank you for reading. Thank you for still breathing. Thank you for being a part of this community and being vulnerable. The Suicide Hotline and Other Selfish Rants",1
I do not feel depressed yet I have been diagnosed with it I just do not want to live and for some reason mental health professionals think being suicidal means your depressed which I am not I just do not see the point of me being here that is all not because I am sad or depressed I just do not see the point of life really. Misdiagnosed with depression,1
"I do not know why I self-deprecate so much. Is it because some part of me still lacks confidence even after I worked so much on it? Am I scared? Am I just lazy? Am I stupid? Or is it just that I have been way too overwhelmed and life has actually been hard on me so to a certain degree this is justified?? I do not know. Perhaps a combination of all I just said. Its almost like I did not want to apply but I did not want anyone else to have it either. Perhaps I felt too sure, thinking this opportunity will always be there?I actually am busy with a lot of stuff. I am in college (although I am a little bit too old for that as well). I have also gone through a lot of trauma (both mild and severe) throughout the years. So I do understand that I need to be kind to myself because I needed time to heal. But I just hate being unproductive and lazy. I hate it when people use excuses to justify their shitty behavior. I have seen how ugly it looks; I do not want to be one of those. There seems to be this repetitive pattern in my behavior that I deny myself from opportunities. Maybe deep down there is an unconscious part of me that feels like I do not deserve to have a better life? Is it because I have been bullied so much in the recent past, that it has left me filled with shame and guilt? I have noticed that I do the exact same thing in dating too. I know I have a great personality and naturally I deserve to love and to be loved, but then again, whenever I want to date, I keep thinking that I need to fix my life first. Like I am not good enough. But I know that is just an excuse. I just do not know why I have all these excuses. I understand that life is already happening in between; there is not supposed to be a perfect moment where I start living. Yet, this broken mentality will not let go, despite the fact that I keep empowering myself everyday.How do I stop?? How do you break free from your past? How do you stop procrastinating when you have ADHD? Yes, meds do help with focus, and self-discipline makes things better, but still, here I am. How do I make things... like... better better? I just lost an amazing job opportunity because I procrastinated so much with applying for it. Now its taken. I feel awful.",0

"This is just one long rant.My family fights. Mainly, it is just Daniel and I, Daniel being the one my mom married before I was born. I do not consider him anything close to a father figure, but he is the only thing I have other than teachers, counselors, or school staff. Fighting has taken a toll on me, a lot. I am always the one at fault and he makes sure to phrase it in a way that makes me the one in the wrong, always. This has ended up with me scared of loud noises, feeling like a failure, feeling unloved, depressed, scared of hurting people, scared of being around people, scared of making mistakes, scared of offending people, scared of authoritarian figures that would coincide with father figures, defensive, rude in many cases, and in some ways, unable to properly read cues, though this might be an autism thing. For just over ten years, we have been digging a huge pit of anger and hate, mainly my hate for him, and the grief that comes with not feeling loved by someone who you see everyone else loved by. The depression stemming from the constant battling has ended me up in hospital three times due to being suicidal after fights, mainly because I feel like a disappointment. I end up wanting to punch him in the face, push him out the door, and lock every single entrance but I will never be strong enough emotionally for that. I am already a failure as is.I find it incredibly hard to cry, mainly because of how much I did in the early years, and have ended up being semi-violent when it comes to confrontations with him. I will end up throwing things or slamming doors because I want to get away from him at all costs, I want to put something in between me and him. This usually ends up with me wanting to kill myself, like today. I did the only thing I could think of in the midst of the pain and depression today, I left the house and walked to the open space nearby. there is a bench there I am fond of. I managed to cry up there. I am glad nobody was out today. I contemplated commiting. I am glad I did not. I contemplated running away. I am glad I did not. The only thing keeping me sane is the people I love and I hate it so much. I feel like I should live for more than just spite and to make others happy. I just want to be happy.The thing that hurts the most is when I see families having fun together. A dad and his child reading a book on the sidewalk. A mom and her daughter walking the family pets. A husband and wife taking their toddler in a stroller.It makes me feel raw hate. Hate to myself that I cannot be a better person. Hate to myself that I cannot have that because I cannot control what little temper I have. Hate that despite everything I do, he cannot take responsibility for anything. I hate it. I hate me.How can I be happy when my whole life is pain and sadness? How can I be happy when the person I am supposed to look up to despises me more than the dogs I pass in their yards? Why do the *dogs* pause to see if I am ok longer than he does. I want happiness. Please. I would give anything for that peace.tldr: I am in pain. I hate myself, my dad, everything I am. I just want happiness. I feel like shit and I need to rant. Thisll be long, you do not have to read. Tw; suicide, self harm",0

I am a 45 year old man and the one question i have never been able to figure out completely.Why is it the easiest person to lie to is ourselves? I have lied to myself so many times over the years and i know they are lies because i am the one who makes it up and yet i choose to believe it even though i know it will hurt me. The deepest scars on my soul are from lies i chose to believe as true. just a question i have asked myself all my life.,0
"I worry if I am on it for like a year or more I will start getting sexual disfunction and stuff, I am only 16 so I really do not want this. I have been on 8mg citalopram for 4 days now and have experienced no real side effects, just maybe drowsiness and nausea but the nausea is super mild and idk if the drowsiness is really even from the meds because I have always kind of felt a lil drowsy. its not affected my sex drive at all, and i really pray and hope it does not, because I am only 16 as i said. i do not want it to ruin anything for me. if i go up to 16mg do you think it will? I am going up in only 3 days to 16mg. I am excited because I have noticed benefits with it already, like getting rid of my morning tremors that have affected me for like over a year now. everything else could possibly be a placebo... like how i feel like I am better in the morning. normally id be super angry and just tense but i have not felt tense at all really. like mentally.i only plan to be on them for maybe 6 months at most, i just worry about long term side effects, and it seems like everyone has story about it affecting their sex drive. thank God mine is still fine. but its a little weird how everyone experiences a lot of side effects the first week and i feel almost nothing... is something wrong? is it not working for me? idk. the anxiety and depression have not went away though, just a lil better on depression. i hope to see major progress though soon, and I am going to go to therapy and cbt and hopefully with help from that i can come off them and be recovered or something. but yeah, what do you guys think? how long should i stay on them to not get long term stuff? thank you. How long should I stay on antidepressants?",0

I should not feel hurt bc I am the one who keeps saying that I will really do it. I feel guilty. A lot. But I should not. For now I may feel normal but I know that later, tomorrow, I will feel the pain again for the rest of my life. It never stops. And I do not want to go through it anymore.

He did not get the message (or did not care ) and kept trying to get me to give in. I did, I was tired and feeling pretty unworthy/unlovable.

I am 23 years old with two kids and a beautiful wife. I feel so hopefully everyday feels like the day I am going to die. Between her family and my family plus her friends no one likes who i am. She went on a trip with her friends this weekend and the one picture i see of her at night is passed out in a bar. I text her friend and she acts like she is fine and everything. I am getting to the point with this depression that i need answers on what to do with my life. I feel like i do not belong on this earth and i was a mistake being here. I have chronic migraines everyday so that dosent help with any of this. Her friends are just telling me that they also have mental health problems and i need to just let them handle her. Since I have been married for over four years i feel like i should be worried about my wife around them. I would never divorce my wife because how much she means to me and what she has done for me plus helping me from depression. Any suggestions what to think or do. Sorry if i rambled. Help with my depression,0
"So for a while now I have had thoughts, that death is not as bad, death is peace, that if died today, I would not have a problem with that, I would be relieved actually. So this are not plans to do something, just thoughts, but asking a friend, he told me he had never had those thoughts... I have them daily. is not it normal?",0
"I have been working on getting better. I read a lot of your posts, and it disappoints me how many of us feel completely isolated from other people. Emotionally, we are trapped. Never feeling like we belong in the same existence as those around us. I do not know if that will change. Maybe someone will come around who things as I do, or understands my beliefs. The reality is, we do not know. So yes, I acknowledge how difficult this is for me, and so many of you like me. I do not have a lot of advice, and maybe this is me writing this to tell myself to listen but, stop worrying about the past. We lose people, we make mistakes, and we certainly miss out on opportunities. Moving through those past moments is the only option. Dwelling on situations that hold you down does nothing but solidify your beliefs of hate in yourself. Forgive yourself. They might never care that you are sorry, but you know you are. You know you grew from that mistake. My point is, sometimes you have to realize that you cannot gain anything else from constantly remembering the past. Some of us cannot help it, and I get that. Just do what you can. Be safe. Always reach out. The past does not own you",1
"I am 26 i live alone and i looked this morning and i just have my last 0.22 eurocents until the 2nd of september.I am a uni student and I am supposed to get money from the university which got postponed.I cannot work right now as i have some exams , i ll start working in september.I have nothing else to sell, and little to no food left and i can barely sleep from the anxiety .I live in a shitty 3rd world country and i have no charities or organizations in my city that can help and I am just completely alone....i feel pathethic i do not kniw what to do i tried everything.Experiencing the darkest days of my life now I am at rock bottom",0
"I should preface this with I have been on a downhill for the past few months. A few days ago while at work I was writing on a paper and basically venting about my recent issues, I kind of zoned out while writing and when I reread it I realized I had wrote a suicide note. This definitely is not the first but it is the first in a long time. I am seeking mental help through therapists but the earliest they could get me in was mid August. I feel like my shift in attitude has pushed away all my friends and then because they are withdrawn from me I feel even worse and I do not want to talk to them about it because I do not want to put my burden on their shoulders. I have turned to drinking pretty much every day this past week to try and cope. I really want to make it to August but I do not know what else to do. How do I stop myself from catastrophizing and making myself think that everyone hates me? How do I stop my brain from creating all these scenarios that make me so sick and sad all the time? I feel like I have tried everything short of a 12 gauge. Need some advice",1
"I am alone with my kids, like I am all the time, because my husband works all the time and I got fired and have no life. I think killing myself is inevitable. I wanted to find a therapist but I cannot. I wanted to get better but I cannot. I have four degrees and no career because I am on the autism spectrum and have bad PTSD and imposter syndrome from my parents telling me they hated me, that I was worthless, that they wished I were dead. And then I was bullied at school. And so even though I am technically a genius, I am for all intents and purposes disabled. I have disappointed every mentor because they had such high hopes for me, and I crashed and burned. I have all this knowledge and all these abilities and even a license as a registered nurse and was planning to become a nurse practitioner, but I cannot use it. Nobody thinks I have anything to offer, except my kids. My kids are little. I know they need me, for now. But still, I am tempted to just put a bullet in my brain. It would have been better if my parents had killed me physically instead of mentally. This is just cruel. As if anyone here could care",1
"Hello all,I just need to vent a bit about my current situation and hoping I can get advice or a simple ear to listen.On my birthday in late May, I was visiting a friend and had an accident in his home. I fell down the basement stairs, busted my head open, and was barely breathing. I thought this was one of my best friends, but he never once visited me in the ICU or hospital and now we rarely speak. Its breaking my heart.3 days after being home from ICU, I received a call that my grandfather passed away. I still am incapable of processing this.I am currently on disability leave from work and I get paid 60% of my salary. It has been almost 2 months but nothing has improved. All day long I am driven around to doctor appointments and feel like a helpless child. I need to go back to work as soon as possible and cannot fathom being able to handle my usual workload.My anxiety and depression is the worst its ever been. I thought it was awful in the past but I was wrong. I cannot sleep until 5am because I am paralyzed with fear. Nothing makes me happy. I have no interests and cannot do basic chores because I simply do not care. People love me but I feel like I am not good enough for that love. I recently switched to a new psychiatrist right after the accident. My previous one was okay but I was hoping to find someone who understands my needs better. Well, the appointment today with the new psych went terribly. She decided to cut my anti-anxiety rx to 1/3 of my prior dosage which I have been taking for many years, upped my mood stabilizer even though she is aware that I have tried this in the past and higher doses make me very dizzy (and I am struggling with dizziness as a side effect of my brain injury already.) Then she added a drug which gave my boyfriend horrible tremors and ticks. I told her all of this made me incredibly uncomfortable and she did not care. I had to call the pharmacy right away and tell them not to bother filling the prescriptions and to take her name off my file. The last thing I need from all of this is to raise flags and look like a doctor hopper! I am waiting to get back in with my previous psychiatrist.Bills. More bills piling up every day. I have a huge stack and can barely pay rent with my 60% salary.I live alone and today was the worst I have had in years. I am not planning to harm myself but am struggling with a reason to continue living. I was happy before the accident and now I feel like an impostor in my own life. Brain injury, betrayal, family death, and depression",0
"She was my only friend, my best friend. The only person that even really cared about me. And I knew she did not love me back, but I did not think I would lose my friend. I miss her so much. I miss hearing her voice and talking to her every day. I ruined it. I ruined everything. My only friend is gone and Ill never forgive myself. I cannot live without her. My best friend will not talk to me since I told her I loved her. I am going to drive to her house with a gun and shoot myself in front of her.",0
"A friend from the Army called me yesterday to tell me his plans to take his life. He had a fucked experience with the VA, as an employee and patient, and thinks the best way to get people to notice how he was treated is to kill himself. I do not think that is the only reason. Hes had problems forever and apparently tried last year. He had a girl dump him that hurt him really bad. Hes just tired of his life and does not see a reason to live. Hes mid thirties and not white. I think the racist fucks in this country definitely are not helping. He seems very clear headed in his decision and told me the plans in great detail. He said it made him happy to speak about it. I have absolutely no idea what to do but I cannot just let this happen. Any ideas? Please. A friend is planning and I need help stopping him",1

"Long story short. I am a guy. I was in therapy for few years with the same therapist. she is probably old enough to be my mom. I was delusional when I first met her. I did not know that I was delusional at the time. After few weeks of meeting her I started feeling that she is my mom. But she did not know. I kept it a secret. But eventually I told her about it. After few years I started feeling that she is my real mom. I love her a lot, I want her in my life. I feel depressed because I cannot meet her anymore. Can your therapist be continue to be in your life on compassionate grounds? I feel depressed without her. I wish I was not delusional when I first met her. She helped me change my life. I do not know what is happening to me. Can someone help me understand? Help me understand (it is about my therapist)",0
Soo umm i am a 15 year old studying in 11th (I know its pretty young) and was wondering what to do..I actually am pretty confused what to do I am not afraid to die but even if i die someday i wish it to be quick. After surfing through internet and much more I came to a realization that only studies matter in this world..If you cannot study your life can never be secure and you will face hardships. The constant nagging from parents to study and them always pointing out faults criticising us...(My parents are actually good it is just that on studies things happen.. they do not beat me but those petty fights and unknowingly pressurising me)I many a times get lecture from them about how important is future and why i need to work hard for the upcoming years. The fact is that i know it pretty well but i cannot find the motivation in doing it.. I love my family a lot it is just that( I am sorry its very complicated to explain) I do not even know why i am writing this post. I am just unsure what to do I do not want to commit suicide or anything as i know it will devastate the family and i also have a little brother whose life i do not want to ruin by dying I change topics very quickly as you can see by reading this post Its just like i do not know my true feelings..my true selfI am not able to concentrate right now and just umm never mindmy mind is going wobble Uncertain About Life,1

"My doctor is switching me from cipralex to welbutrin and I am just wondering if anyone has any experience with these two. Copralex is good, it is served me best out of everything else I have been on but it also has not gotten me out of my usual mood of pure apathy or anxiety. I have almost 0 interest in doing anything. I am scared of switching medications just because I do not know how I will react to it. I have pretty bad anxiety, and the side effects mention that it might make anxiety worse. I do not want it to make me feel worse or affect my sex drive which is already lower because of antidepressants. it is just an all around shit show.

"If you want some more information, please read my previous post. But I am not doing good at the moment. Could really do with talking to someone. I do not want to talk about my problems, I would just love to have a chat with someone, about anything.

I might not be very talkative to start with as I can be a bit shy, but I would appreciate even just listening to someone. My only rule would be I would want to talk to someone who is female. As I have bad experiences with talking to guys online, and I cannot trust them and feel very anxious on call with them.

"I am 20 years old (M) and have been having recurring nightmares for the past month that my gay best friend (34M) blew me while I was blackout drunk and passed out. I was slightly worried that it might not have been a dream, but thought there was no way he would ever do something like that.For some background: He had tried to stick his hands down my pants numerous times one night, doing it successfully once and fondling me. I did not talk to him for a year and told him when I got back in contact with him how much it messed me up, and that if he ever did anything like that again Id never speak to him. He promised me he would not.Today I was messaging him and told him that I got a new girlfriend, and he made a comment saying that he wishes he could have blown me again. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about, and he said nothing I guess... and we conversed a bit more and he said that he sucked my dick when we were both drunk.I genuinely thought it was just a vivid nightmare, but it was not. I feel violated, in shock, devastated, enraged, and a million other emotions I cannot begin to describe. I do not know how to deal with this. I have been depressed lately and going through a lot as it is, and this is another huge blow to my mental health.Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I Was Raped By My Best Friend &amp; do not Know How To Process It",0
"Hi, so usually i come back to this subreddit when shit hits the fan, and I cannot handle it anymore. I do not really know how to start with these, it is always difficult especially with all the emotion and pain, but I guess I will, start with what is bothering me right now. I had this girlfriend in 2017 and I deeply regret how things ended with her and I, I also regret ending it, because i did it thinking that I had no love for her and that I was only in the relationship for the sex. What I learnt though (this was in early 2018 with therapy) was that I had intrusive thoughts, what had happened was that this thought of not loving her had popped up in my head at some point, and I could not stop thinking about it while in the relationship with her. It was horrible I felt as if I was lying to her throughout the relationship. it is like having a person on your shoulder shouting liar every moment, my only peace was away from her. I saw the only way out was to say ""I do not love you anymore"". I was 19 at the time and so was she, so we were both young, but I hate myself still to this day for doing that and not maybe discussing it first with someone. She was my first love, how we met was pretty magical, we were sitting across from one another and I started to sing one her favourite band songs, and she looked at me and we both began discussing our favourite bands and interests. I knew in that instance that I was attracted to her without a doubt and i think she was as well. The worst part I think about that breakup was that I had no one at varsity to talk to anymore, I was alone with all those thoughts and I started hating the world even more, nearly as much as I hated myself. I think that was the worst moment in my life, worse than anything else. Because I felt like a monster for hurting someone I loved, something I thought I would not do. I wish I could kill myself, I wish I could plunge a knife into my neck and bleed out until i pass out, until I am nothing with no thoughts, just a fucking corpse. Maybe then everything will be calm and I would not have to worry about making mistakes like that again. I am too much of coward anyway, i do not like pain. This all started because of old voice note that might have been her. Funny. Sorry about the violent imagery. I just wanted to talk. Just talking.",1

"Hello. Its me. Again. If you want to read this, do it. If no, then do not.Look, this is a dark world. Everyone is not truly happy, no one is. Even if you say so. Everyone has a mask. And everyone is hiding something. I am trying so fucking bad. I was trying to get better. And I see I am getting worse. Now I am trying to hide it.

At a moment, the light bulb is breaking, and you are sad. The light bulb goes away. Oh, you expected the happy ending ? Another light bulb coming back ""if yOu tRy aNd fIgHt"" ? Nah.you are waiting there, for the light bulb to come. But instead, darkness and dust comes. And you give up, breaking too.Everything has an end. Sometimes we create it, sometime it creates it self.And sometimes, we wait for it, but it does not come. And we stay there, we suffer.Hey, ask you this question : ""Do I want to die, or things to get better?"". You would say the second answer. No one wants to die, everyone wants to live for eternity. No one does. Everything has an end. And this place is surrounded by ice and darkness. And you want to go to warm and light. So either you wait and suffer, breaking apart slowly, either do it right away.This is life.Suck it up.No one wins.Everyone looses. Hey.",1

Posting this for myself. To hold myself accountable and to let things go into the ether. I have been in a depressive hole for the past 2 years and have been working on the journey out but keep getting knocked down by life and my own bad habits. I take medication and do talk therapy every week. But I also smoke weed everyday which at this point feels like its almost counteracting all the work meds and therapy have been doing. I feel myself ashamed of my life and hating myself. I just wish I did not have to be conscious. I have been having invasive thoughts of self harm and wondering what would happened if I disappeared from this world. I have a few friends that I hold close and are there for me which I am so grateful for. But this thing inside me keeps wanting to kill me. I know they are just thoughts and everything will be fine.

Yes, people on here claimed that that was my problem without knowing me and without me saying anything of the like.**''it is your mindset, that is what keeps people from befriending / falling in love with you''*Yeah, right. that is why abusive men who just know how to act normal in front of others get to have beautiful, normal, lovely women by their side who are unable to break up because the guy made her seriously love him. These kinds of people have the most fucking insecure mindset you could imagine but because they are just so good at dealing with people by nature without having to practice the tiniest fucking bit everyone wants to suck their cocks.**''You just have not found the right people yet''**I am fucking 24. TWENTY-FOUR. THE OLDER YOU GET THE HARDER IT GETS. STOP DISMISSING EVERYTHING FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!! HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL I FIND ''THE RIGHT PEOPLE''?IF YOU ASSUME THAT EVERYONE / MOST PEOPLE ARE SHIT, YOU ARE TOLD IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR BEING ALONE BECAUSE YOU THINK OF OTHERS THAT WAY, IF YOU do not, PEOPLE TELL YOU ALL THE PEOPLE you have MET WERE JUST SHIT. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  FUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHITAnd EVERY FUCKING TIME I tell THIS to people (both of the above) they shut the fuck up because they realise that I am right, but at the same time they will not admit it because they subconsciously seem to believe that admitting these things makes their lives pointless and they want to kill themselves. Worst case, because they are out of arguments, they just say ''you are wrong. you are just depressed. it is your depression talking.'' or they even get angry XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD**''You are your own best friend''**Have fun getting a good job from yourself. Have fun having sex with yourself. Have fun talking to yourself. Have fun living 90 years of your stupid live and dying all alone by yourself.**''You are not being kind to yourself. Just because someone rejected your friendship does not mean that there is anything wrong with you.''**Yeah, be kind to yourself for being absolute dog shit at everything you do, even when you do it for 8 hours a day for 12 years of your life. Be kind to yourself for breaking your wardrobe out of anger. A couple of doors. A window. Be kind to yourself for being snappy with the few friends you had and treating them badly (NO I do not DO IT ANYMORE, PEOPLE STILL FUCKING HATE ME, YES THAT MEANS I HAVE IMPROVED BUT IT does not MEAN ANYTHING TO OTHER PEOPLE APPARENTLY, and let us NOT act like it is a giant achievement anyway). Be kind to yourself for being so incredibly socially awkward with people that they automatically assume you are a rapist serial killer werewolf. Be kind to yourself and every one of your problems will magically go away. it is just like just believing in yourself that you are going to pass the exam tomorrow without having studied for it at all, or having studied for 5 days straight without understanding a single thing because you are too stupid.it is all bullshit. What these people do not understand is that having a ''positive mindset'' ONLY WORKS IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR. I CANNOT BE HAPPY BY BEING IGNORANT OF WHAT I AM.**''I am just trying to help''**How incredibly self-less of you. Are you? Or are you just telling yourself that so you can think that you are much greater than you already think you are? This is a classic defensive reaction when people realise that what they just said is incredibly dismissive and mean.Some of these people even claim they have depression and at the same time call suicidal people selfish (or ''more selfish'', my enw favourite).People are SO unable to see life through someone else's lens it is fucking disgusting. You talk and talk. You seriously believe just because your life is perfect and you get EVERYTHING you want means that everyone can do it and they are just NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH. FUCK YOU! Just because YOU are happy being alone does not mean that everyone can be. Just because you are happy with never being loved does not mean that everyone can feel the same. Just because you do not care that you are horrendously shit at conversation does not mean that everyone can accept it. Just because you are fine with being unfuckable does not mean everyone likes being it. Stop being so fucking arrogant and ignorant. Admitting these things does not mean that you are shit and that you should kill yourself. If you can deal with it, GOOD FUCKING JOB! No, seriously, I am glad that you are fine with yourself. But also seriously, GET OVER YOURSELF and stop FUCKING DISMISSING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS AND SUFFERING. it is SO INFURIATING.Yeah I would kill myself if I could, BUT I cannot. I literally cannot get ANYTHING right in my life. I am too afraid to die. I just want to stop suffering. I am so sick and tired of not belonging anywhere. I am so sick and tired of being the universe's laughing stock. I am so sick and tired of being my parent's toy. I am so sick and tired of being shit at EVERYTHING I do no matter how hard I study or practice. it is completely fucking hopeless.I JUST do not IMPROVE.I talked to so many people I did not know at all and my ''SOCILAOIAILL SK)ILLZZZ''JUST NEVER GET FUCKING BETTER. I CANNOT IMPROVE. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING BY MYSELF. it is POINTLESS.I will just get drunk again. I finally know why my mother keeps doing it. Felt good the first time around and I might as well just do what my parents are doing. Second time I did not feel super happy like before but I also barely suffered because it numbs you nicely. it is not like anyone gives a shit. After all it is all just in my head right? Nothing is real. All of this must be a simulation... there is no other way... I cannot get the help I need and nobody, truly, gives a shit. My problems are just getting dismissed by everyone and I am led to believe that all the problems I am facing are hallucinations facilitated by my depression and it is driving me insane. Why is everyone trying to destroy me?",0
"so I will just feeling extremely sad again , and deleted some social medias where some friends would be able to talk to me so I can stop talking to then , we were going to watch a movie but since I could not get there in time, the only way would be if it was delayd by 2 hours, wich they did not want , what makes me feel horrible is that I would do it for them , I know is stupid its not about the movie is just I wish I people cared about me,and know this just sounds so stupid,but to me those things just make feel terrible , moments like these makes see just how unimportant I am , and I feel bad because is like I am dragging people down , that is why I will stop talking with the friends I have now , sowhen I do something in the near future no one would feel bad about it , even though I do not think anyone would care its just so no one feels sad or something Feeling pretty down",1

I am sorry i cannot do it anymore. you cannot save me anymore. i have ruined everything I am poison I am toxic. i know the last thing i do is hurting everyone but maybe its worth it. maybe hurting them all one last time would save them from years of hurt and worry.

"I was having a discussion recently about this. I see ideation as thinking about suicide as an escape, but a tendency is to have the inhibition to make a plan.

"I will be an adult in a year and *still* nothing's going right. The pandemic sucks, but practically none of this has to do with the pandemic. All of these were issues long before covid happened. And then when I become an adult I will just feel like a burden to my family because I really cannot do anything right. I got diagnosed with high functioning autism and I am pretty sure a lot of my problems are related to that but honestly I just do not care. Whether I was neurotypical or autistic that does not change that my problems are here, and that I do not want to deal with them. I mean, I will deal with them alright but that solution frankly ends in a rope or a big bang from my side of things. I have been dealing with these issues for too long, majority of them since I was a kid... and then I become an adult? Where life is just supposed to get harder? If my childhood was shit and my teen years were (are) shit, what the hell am I supposed to do as an adult? that is just going to be shit too? And I mean, fuck, the crumbling economy and being a kid who is about to be an adult in the middle of a pandemic and with the world on fire sure as heck does not help. I wish suicide was deemed as an acceptable way out. It does not have to be *your* choice for how to deal with your problems but I definitely wish it could at the very least be a choice for me. I literally did not even ask to be born. do not see a point of living. Everything just seems more miserable from here on out.",1

"From a very young age I have always struggled with severe depression and wanting to take my life in various ways. Each day I think of the multiple ways of wanting to end my life. I have good friends in my life, but depression has been a sever battle for me to fight with. My home life is absolute hell taking care of someone physically disabled, dealing with a rage induced sibling and struggling with intense ptsd. In my young ""tween"" years I was sexually assaulted in my own school by another student, at my first job and back in my first relationship. I struggle with ptsd of my attacks, along being in a stressful household. I am a college student with an okay gpa, but I have struggled alot mentally. Words cannot describe the weight of depression and how I feel devoid of emotions. To me, it is like someone shut off a part of my brain where I feel and I put on a fake persona or forced to show I am okay. On multiple occasions, I have tried telling my parents and other family (sterotypical christians against mental health or psychic meds) and they refuse to get me help or anything saying I have nothing. I am in a world where I cannot be happy, being judged on my body or being ""loved"" under certain conditions. I feel like a good part of what I once was died a long time ago or I rarely got to experience happiness. I just want to get better mentally or just run away all together. Just Dead Inside",0

I wish I could just disappear and not have to be facing this at all. it is so tiring.it is kind of strange to think that this could be my last night alive. I do not want to be melodramatic.

"Idk if this is the right place to rant but I am in an ""situation"".I am very much depressed and my psychotherapist told me to take things slow. I do but the thought of costing my parents so much money when I am 21 and still living at home hurts so much and frankly, it is stressing me out more then it should. I tried to get a simple job in a store (you know, product stocking, operate the checkout etc.) but they all want you to have ""completed education"" in that field. I got rejected twice even though I applied for the stocking positions.I know I do not have the head for education. Maybe I will when my depression is better but I am at a point where I really do not know what to do to make it better.I get so bitter when I see online personalities get money for just being themselves / being funny.Best thing is when these people say neets like me jsut need to get a job. Bro I am trying. Everything moves so quickly. Everyone grows up except me. I did not get the chance to ""find"" myself in my teens bc of depressionI'm so tired I hate that you need so much for a simple job",0
"I do not have any friends. I am literally alone and by myself all the time after work. My mom is the only one that cares for me and buys/cooks me food. I just realized now that I am only staying alive because of her. I do not think I can handle living without her. Keeping friendships is the hardest thing I can do. As much as I want to connect with other people, they do not want the same no matter how much I try. I am 32 now and I barely have any hope for a happier life. Life has been brutal and I do not have the strength to stand back up. All I ever wanted was to have good friends and perhaps a family. I do not care about money or power. I do not have it in me to stay strong for long. Thank god my mom is healthy but I think of suicide everyday. I am only staying alive because I do not want to because her any pain.Someone please help me. I do not know what to do. I am going to commit suicide when my mom dies.",1
"I feel vulnerable so often that I am starting to become fed up with living. I just want to be free from my constant anxiety and depression. Even as I write this, I want to drop dead leaving behind my fears of the world. I mean, we are all going to die anyway, what difference does it make if it happens now? As much as I admire the human race, I am also terrified of it. I find that the most dangerous people are often the most average. Having that mentality, it is hard to not feel threatened constantly. I cannot be around other people without having a whirlwind of negative emotions such as fear, sorrow, anger, etc. Perhaps I spend too much time on social media but just by observing people, I find that they can be incredibly cruel. You can see this for yourself, just look at the comments section of any youtube video and witness the discourse and anger that flows naturally through people. In my home town, there are large masses of homeless people, and it makes me sad seeing so many folks hit rock bottom. I have seen groups of teenagers beat down on said homeless people right in front of me. I have seen people do drugs, yell, fight, stab, rob. I have seen women do the most awful things to their children in public without any repercussions. I have overheard people spread hatred of other people. I have had family members die in horrible ways. I had old classmates who ended their own lives. I witnessed a man try to commit suicide on the highway. And I swear, I think (I do not know for sure, but I think) I saw one of my neighbors take a child prostitute into his home. I feel like I am surrounded by a society of cruelty and violence. But for some reason, I cannot help but love other people. However, this love does not dissuade me from wanting to leave this world. As childish as it sounds, I just wish that I could be born into a life where these issues are nonexistent. Despite being disturbed by appalling human behavior, I cannot help but fixate on it. It just feels like there are few positives in the world, and I just want to free myself from it. Living is terrifying",0
"If I walk out onto oncoming traffic, would it be my fault if someone hits me? They can swerve.

"Just 2 weeks ago got the diagnosis of having bpd (borderline personality disorder) which basically is a very narrow ability to feel things. it is either very high or very low - nothing in between and depression ""just"" is a side effect of it. it is not same for everyone but to me it was i never was able to feel things like being in love or like someone. it was either fully love someone or hate of which the love part got lost over the last 10-15 years. All that i have since i was 6 years old... now - 40 years later (10 weeks ago) it went so heavy and unhandable that i decided to start a therapy. first weeks i thought ""ah - therapy does not help anything - maybe better stop it"" but i was super lucky with the doctor in there - i started to build up trust to him (which for a borderliner is extremely rare) and more weeks went in. At around week 7 or 8 some weird effects kicked in - i started to get feelings i never knew before (all that stuff that is in between very high and very low) which is very irritating because there is no way for me to handle those feelings. Some i even cannot name. But i read and i talked to the therapists and found out that this is the way to get around with the illness...next step would be get rid of the self harm and suicidal thoughts and the deep wrath and hate which is my base feeling level (only against myself - never against another person). Problem with that is that this will take around 3 to 7 years. Sorry for long intro but now to the problem : one of those new feelings is what others would call being in love. Have no experience with that feeling and as dumb as it sounds no idea how to handle it (i know that usually every teen knows what to do with this feeling) and i fell in love with one of the women who also are in therapy where i am. This feeling is so strange and hurts so extremely much that i just had to vent about it to people who may understand it at least a bit. Acting towards this feeling is totally impossible to me because i will not know how and it would be super selfish because that woman has her own problems to carry. (besides the part that times where women were attracted to me are long gone.)I know it is a very long text and that maybe no one has the nerve and / or time to read all us. It just had to get out. :) Thanks to all who read anyway and also to those who do not just for being here ! Borderline in trouble",0

I feel myself slipping away from everyone and everything. I only sleep when my body requires it and it shuts me down.

"My mother is about to turn 70. She is a widow. Through an unfortunate set of circumstances (including years of guilt tripping on her part), I have found myself living at home with her again. She is also something of a narcissistic abuser. I understand that this is partly due to her own trauma with her own parents.She broke her arm recently and it gave me a taste of what being her caregiver would be like and I am terrified. She has a plethora of health issues (some of which I believe to be exaggerated or that could be mitigated if she would just follow some reasonable health advice), but I know her well enough to know that if she can rely on me to do something, she would do that rather than try to be independent.Everything I have read online about being a caregiver talks about how hard it is, but these people also say they would not have traded the experience for the world because of the time they got to spend with their parents. I cannot help but think that these people must have had better relationships with their parents to begin with.I cannot see a way out of it - if I leave, I will never be free of the guilt trips from her and others in her life, unless I cut them off entirely. I hate the thought of her playing the victim and making me out to be a terrible villain for doing what is best for me.If I stay, I do not think I will survive because the thought of it makes me feel like I am suffocating. It makes me feel like my life is over already.I come from the sort of world where suicidal ideation is not taken seriously - it is seen as ""asking for attention"" or ""being manipulative"". Saying something like ""The thought of being my mother's caretaker makes me think about suicide"" would not be met with sympathy, but rather with judgement about what a horrible person I amI am not in any danger right now, but I think about suicide and self-harm every day.

"I have had a problem with building **intimacy** for **years** now. I have had a problem with cheating.

I have **2 failed engagements** and **cheated** on **everyone** I ever been with in some **form**. they are attractive **people** and for the most part **sane**. All **older** than me by about 4-9 years. I **realized** I could not keep **hurting** people I **loved** or **claimed** to and I began self-improvement (not a fan of that word). I took time to learn skills by taking leadership courses online, learning Arabic, serious fitness training, trading securities, Biblical studies, competition running, cycling, significantly increasing my income and helping my family etc. I did not involve myself with a partner for about 1.5 years neither relationally nor romantically.***More Background but not relevant:***I reached a point of what others may consider ""success"". I purchased a rental property and had enough in liquid funds that I do not worry about living expenses as much as I use to. I felt disciplined and in-control but also like something was missing. I have youth, energy, but lack time as I know it will end one day and I will age. I see myself as an observer and do not attract many people socially. I have not put much effort into (romantic or social) relationships most of them have gravitated towards me. I do not know if it is my stare or my looks but I do know I struggle expressing myself verbally at times. Most of the people I tend to avoid are those that bring aggression or some form of untreated resentment. I cannot tolerate a whiner or someone who believes they are better than someone else because of something material or circumstances they had no control over.***Boom COVID and Quarantine:***I realized the world is not meant for solitude and I craved interaction even if it was meaningless conversation about weather. I met a person online that I felt comfortable with going steady we saw each other casually for about 8 months before I proposed something steady, I told this person about my past and trust issues. Childhood, etc. I have been in a relationship with this person for about 10 months now and my thoughts are re-surfacing. I find myself of scenarios that play out and then start feeling as if they are true.***Adding color:***I work from home and I go to the gym every day after work. During work I could be focused on a task and once the task is complete my mind does not know what my partner is doing and it bothers me when I do not receive constant communication. I do not want to be needy anymore. I find myself thinking of driving to where they live to observe them just to check they are not cheating or something. I find myself thinking of entering their social media pages to read messages etc.***My ask:***What can I do to lessen these thoughts and let go? I tried prayer, I tried meditation, I tried learning hobbies, focusing on myself and being okay with being cheated on. I do not know what else to do as it is becoming a constant pattern in my relationships. So much so that I do not know if I can continue my current relationship without hurting the person without intentions but through my thoughts becoming reactions.tldr; I choose to cheat on people I love and get annoyed with putting up with them after a certain point. I focus on the initial stages a lot but then have trouble with my own likes/dislikes that I start adopting their likes/dislikes and get depressed.

"Hey guys! My partner recently (2 months ago) suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown (for want of a better phrase). He was on citalopram for about 4 years previous to this and in January he started to slowly come off it, tapering the dose very gradually over the next few months until he got down to 10mg. At this point he hit a total low and got a shock so jumped himself back up to 30mg (not the best idea but he panicked). A few weeks later is when he suffered his mental breakdown, the weeks prior being full of mood swings, irritable, quick to anger, irrational thinking etc etc. Eventually it got too much. The crisis team got involved and the doctor decided that citalopram probably was not the best thing for him anymore so switched him to mirtazapine, cross-titrating it with cit for the first couple of weeks (8 weeks ago). After a couple of weeks they dropped his cit completely and upped his dose of mit to 30mg from 15mg. Its been 6 weeks since this point. At first he seemed to be getting better but about 4 weeks ago started suffering massively with depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, extreme paranoia (effecting our relationship), obsessive thoughts, total irrational thinking, an inability to keep the bad thoughts in, quick to anger, what he calls brain tizziness which is a physical feeling apparently, tunnel vision, all the rest, you name it. Hes really struggling and is at the point where hes getting really distressed and upset at the thought that hes the only person who has ever been through this and worried that it will never get better, or maybe that hes crazy. He was discharged from the crisis team 2 weeks ago but I fear that was too earlyI was wondering if anyone here has had such horrific side effects for so long? How long did it take for them to subside? What did you do to deal with them? Is there anything I can do to help? I will take any advice at the minute because it is awful seeing someone you love in this much pain and unable to help themThank you! Citalopram Withdrawal Side Effects?!",0

Always thought I was bipolar or recurringly depressed or something. I think I may actually kill myself or at least attempt to in a few months. I do not see many people drive their cars into lakes or rivers so I think I may try to do that. but at the same time I am in a good mood right now and I may not? But I think I am consciously acknowledging that there is a reality where I do it. I do not even think I have a good enough reason as to why lol. Shrug I did not think I was suicidal to be honest,1
"He said he was falling to a black hole, and he would not want to meet me. it is been 4 months since. I kept texting him and he responded at first. I got worried when he said that he has not seen or talked to any friends. I know his sleeping and eating patterns were crappy even before. His family or other friends does not know about the depression. He said he has seeked help but I have not heard how is it going. He said that my messaged did not bother and he did not block me or anything even when I said he could ig it get overwhelming. it is been 2 months since he responded mey messages. Should I give him space or keep texting? I guess the history of dating makes me anxious that he would just cut all contact with me. Should I keep checking on a depressed guy (we used to date, but we are just friends now) who has withdrew from anyone and has not responded my texts for months?",0

"Hey guys - I am 32M, and have had pretty severe depression and anxiety for many years now. When I think about it, I think it all started with my mother's death when I was a child, but for many years I buried everything, I got on with life, did not complain, went to school, went to work, did ok in life. But somewhere around the age of 21 I just cracked, I started having sleep problems, I felt anxious and depressed and even had nightmares about my mother a lot and I just could not function. But instead of seeking help I tried to just march on with life, as I had done before, but this time I was not able to. Things got worse, I was isolated, did not respond to messages/calls from people I knew, became more isolated and tried to commit suicide. I wish I had known that I was genuinely depressed. As strange as it sounds I had no idea what was going on with me. Not a single person noticed in my life, they were terrible with things like mental health etc. Not an ounce of support or understanding, just a tacit understanding that I should not talk about anything like this.I spent a period of 2-3 years pretty much bed ridden, even more isolated, lonely, health failing, mind crumbling. But with therapy and medication managed to crawl out of that hole. It has been 10 years now, 10 years of struggle and I still cannot believe it has been that long. I have been destitute, alone, isolated, homeless for a period, jobless for long stretches. Basically just so unwell that I was not able to ever plan for anything, or get my life back together. I was taking it an hour or a day at a time. There were days when just brushing my teeth was an achievement. But how could I explain this to someone? I could barely look after myself.I managed to start medication and get therapy and that was a huge help, and for the past 3 years or so I have been doing ok, but there are still moments when the pain I carry from those difficult years are hard to shake off. I thought I had friends, I thought I had family, but when the time came I was truly alone. Not a single person really helped me, and that broke my heart and changed many of my relationships. I do not feel the same, even though I still see some of these individuals...Anyway, long story short, I think I am doing ok now, but at times it really gets me down when I think of all the time I have lost, I know there is nothing I can do about it, and on better days I tell myself just to carry on and it will be ok. I try not to compare myself to friends or anyone else, but at times I look around and see people I know, people who were at one stage the same as me, and they are doing great in terms of career and relationships, and I am truly happy for them, but I see myself and it really crushes me. It dawns on me how truly sick I was and how much time I have lost, and it is hard to get myself out of that hole. I feel like I still struggle a lot and it has cost me relationships/friendships and also financially/career-wise. I look healthy, I am tall, have hair, in very good shape, but I cannot seem to tell anyone, a few times I have tried but how do you open up with such heavy stuff. Family members have just dismissed me, and acquaintances sometimes cannot believe me because they say I look like I am well. But deep inside, there are days and weeks where I feel such pain that I do not know if I can carry on.I do not know why I am posting this today, I have had an ok week, but this morning I woke up and just felt terrible. I am still on medication and yesterday picked up some more from the pharmacy. The only thing is because I take generic sertraline sometimes the brands change, I do not know if my mood has anything to do with the fact that I started taking another brand of sertraline the other day...but I just feel so low right now, have not felt like this in months, I feel like killing myself, it is a horrible soul-crushing feeling and I feel like I should hang myself to just stop feeling this. It just crept up on me all of a sudden. I know this sounds a bit negative but I just needed to reach out and talk to some fellow human beings, and just be heard and listened to, I do not have anyone I can tell and I feel like I am drowning right now. I feel such profound pain it is almost making me cry, which never happens. Like my mood is just out of whack and cannot be controlled.Please, anyone, help, suggest something or just say you hear me and that I am not alone. I really need to just talk to someone, or to be heard. Having a really bad day.",0
"Today is not a very good day and I just want to share it with someone who cares. I out of medication and it is very distressing that with just one day without meds can be really bad.

"This is more of a rant than a need for advice. everyone is living their life. My siblings went off, got married, had kids, and are busy all the time. My best friend, who I have always been in love with since we were in high school, got in a new relationship and does not call me anymore. The boy I started to like a lot, ghosted me out of the blue. And that just felt like another abandonment.Friends that I cared about, ended our friendship over something they did and blamed me for. I have no job. My moneys running out. And I am just getting closer and closer to dying.When I die, all of these people will say how close they were to me. And yet, at the first chance they got, they were all gone. I have been going to the lake park near my house almost every night. I think its the place Ill drown myself in. This life is just too much for some of us. No matter how many chances and tries we give it, sometimes we just were not meant to live to see old age. I have done a lot of things in my life. Made a difference in peoples life. Ill be remembered by someone. I have stayed around for my family. Stayed around for the hope that one day, something will remind me that I am still alive. everyone is keep telling me things will be different, but I have felt this way since I was a teenager.I always said, Id die at 27. Be a part of the 27 club. Just to be a part of something. But even that seems like an impossible dream to make it to.I am tired. And I keep seeing my mother calling to me to come home. I miss her. She was the only one that ever understood me. And I just want to go be with her and put myself out of this misery. I ask God every night to not let me see the next day. And yet, here I still am. everyone is moved on, and do t even notice I am slipping",0

"When I was fifteen, my emotions were pretty concrete like words emanating from an angry mouth, with no retrieval. Each syllable sounded so clear like listening to the rustling winds while staring at the moon; and being stuck in one place as the ages progressed. Various emotions clearly demarcated like boundary lines separating countries. The world was at peace. Love meant love. Sadness meant sadness. Happiness meant happiness. There was not any intermixing, any mixed races.Pain was a traveller- transcending, moving, relocating, staying and leaving; I run out of verbs. Pain was a libertine, leaving bits of it in every emotion until they forgot if they were themselves or just fragments of pain. Moving about the emotion fabric, creating ripples and breaking barriers, it started tearing my emotions apart. The world seemed to be gathering arms for an impending war.As I got back up, still staring at the moon hearing the rustling winds as if they were violin strings creating music in the air- ages had progressed. My emotions had lost their colour- turned pale with freckles all over them, like craters left on the ground by she will bombings.Distortions and clarity are not really akin and thus my emotions became a distorted clarity; it was holding on to edges of sanity as its world crumpled in doubt. I was eighteen and I could not differentiate between love and sadness.It stretched and tore apart reaching the limits of insanity, trying to be sane. My emotions became half distortions, half sanity and I stood somewhere on the boundary of two. The new sanity did not look like the fifteen year old one. It had new ideals. It did not believe in love. It loved sadness. Happiness was once in a month movie treat. Hope had a one day expiry clause.The new distortions were still confused about what the post 2a.m I love you meant. People said it all the time but acted like you were only meant to be loved post 2a.m.It was not half sanity, half distortion. It was full pain.By the time I turned twenty, I stopped looking at the moon. I closed my eyes and listened to Bach play Concerto in D Minor, lying silently in my room. My emotions had a new shape- without distortions, fully sane. I stared at the fifteen year old me. I smiled as a tear trickled down my cheek.The new emotions founded nostalgia tragic. They had their own ideals. They were coloured with different paints. Pain was no longer a libertine. It was a colonizer.On a particular day in my life, when I had started believing in my new concrete emotion like Sisyphus finally accepting his fate, someone removed the band aid and the wound was still bleeding. It dwindled, trying to erase itself from existence. It no longer knew what it meant. Happiness seemed like a foreign language and there was no translator. It succumbed waiting to die, but it was covered in bandages. On days, people just termed it as mid-life crisis. It was no longer a crisis. It was a war- destroying everything.The war is over. Yes, Its over. But you need to know It was not a war destroying everything but a god creating something new. The new emotions are beautiful like a symmetric circle rising up into the heaven- looking much like a divine halo. It is no longer countries called happiness or sadness or love or hope or pain. Its one huge continent named life, mixing everything in a perfect blend. When the worlds broke, a tiny broken part formed a small ring overshadowing my emotions and on days, nothing is beautiful. It is just my fears and my insecurities and everything dark, like a distortion.On days, I wonder if it is my emotions hiding my insecurities or the other way round. But at least the war is over. There is no distorted clarity. Age of emotions",0

"2020 and 2021 fucked me too much over. I am a seventeen year old girl, diagnosed with autism, who has had bad experience with my mom's ex boyfriend in the past, my dad abused, raped and tortured my mom who is currently in a hospital because I accidentally triggered her PTSD while having meltdowns.I hate myself so much and the environment around me does not help. I live in a crisis center where I feel like I am treated like trash and I just want to have a normal life again, without annoying children who remind me of my failures. I survived a suicide attempt in March. Since my life has not got any better I realized that I am just a ""dead man walking"". I hurt my body by cutting flesh off it and I just want to die. Just disappear, leaving the world looking like a blob of flesh and blood. My body and I do not deserve a nice looking corpse, a nice funeral or anything like that. Just bury me in a ditch or throw me in a trash can.

"I have already made up my mind. Unless I can switch bodies miraculously I am living on borrowed time. Really, I do not know why I have not killed myself sooner. I am useless and have no achievements but that is not what bugs me. I cannot live with this body. I do not want to do any acceptance self-love crap, I just want to die so I do not have to suffer with this anymore. I am not looking for advice or anything, I am just venting because I have nowhere else to rant off to. I am not depressed either. This is the logical conclusion I have come to that I must end my life. The hardest part right now is finding the right method with the least likelihood of failure and/or mess afterwards. I have already been through a pill overdose which was a shitty attempt but that was two years ago. I am making sure no concerned party calls 911 on me the next time. that is why I am keeping this information from everyone who can stop me. In addition to that, getting 'help' *will* have a worse outcome in my circumstances, believe me. I am already a waste of everyone is resources and my rationale for dying is reinforced through myriad triggers throughout the day. My parents said they would be devastated if something happened to me but I told them that if they really cared about me they would help me find a way to end my suffering for good. They are convinced I just need a med adjustment to feel better but that is not going to fix my gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia. it is all bullshit. The kindest thing someone could do for me right now is point me in the right direction to an easy death that will not traumatize anyone. I am past wanting to get help",1

In the last 3/4 years it was been difficult for me to be comfortable in a group of people because I am always the person with few friends and one of the few without having a relationship with someone. This thing started to affect me mentally because in high school I was barely invited to my friends parties and group activities without any reason and in college I had some bad moments with my colleagues that made change of course (but I was not feeling well in that course too). Then I had a crush in a girl but she did not want anything with me and never gave me attention to me while I was trying to be friendly with her. There were times I felt a completely incompetent and very depressed because I never felt what was being loved by someone and being included in a group of friends that wanted to do something with me. My social life is making me feel depressed,0
"I continue to struggle with meaning and each success seems to bring with it failure and upheaval in my basic needs which stresses me out more and makes me less hopeful about a stable future for myself. I accept that much of my depression stems from getting off of certain drugs and that leading to my seratonin system being off kilter, and I am trying to do things to fix that, like working towards getting on an antidepressant but it just feels like I cannot do anything right and I keep endangering my basics. Like I was kind of down 2 weeks ago, which was exacerbated by a gout flareup which took my ability to walk away for a week. At the end of that flare, just as I had gotten on meds to stabilize my uric acid levels so I could walk, I had a relapse on painkillers and messed up a shared bathroom, leading to leakage in the apartment below and to my imminent eviction from my place (as soon as possible by the end of the month). I am crossing my fingers that the woman whose upstairs area I was planning to move in at the last week of August let us me move in early, and I quickly put an end to my relapse and have an appointment for vivitrol next week (the relapse was at the end of a vivitrol cycle), but it is difficult not to get down on myself, especially as the prospect of homelessness quickly approaches and I only recently managed to free myself of that condition. I just feel like a fuck up, am afraid that I will keep facing this failure repeatedly. I am trying and will not give up anytime soon, but continue to remain frustrated by my continued accrual of consequences which keep adding stress. I do not know. I hope you are having a better week/month/year/life than I am. Keep on keeping on. I hope I can stop making my life more difficult soon. it is frustrating and depressing.",0

Who makes passive aggressive comments about me, to the women at the other desk while I can hear her, and has been putting an anchor on the things she is supposed to be showing me. I feel trapped. I have only gotten a few hours of sleep. I just do not want to do life anymore. Interacting with my coworkers makes me suicidal",1
Idk. Its like I cannot win. Do your friends get mad at you for being depressed after asking you what is wrong?,0
"I cannot get it out of my head. I want to be dead. I want to kill myself. I keep imagining taking a belt and wrapping it around my neck and hanging myself. Would it even work? I fucking hate everything and everyone. I cannot do any of this anymore. what is FUCKING WRONG WITH ME. I have NEVER BEEN GOOD ENOUGH. WHO CAN I BLAME BESIDES MYSELF. I HATE EVERYONE SO FUCKING MUCH. I FUCKING HATE EVERYONE!!!!I do not do anything I am a fucking loser. A loner. A pathetic, selfish, stupid piece of shit. Why cannot I just feel normal. Why cannot I just be fucking happy for once. My whole world feels like a fucking mess. I feel like a disorganized and stupid bastard. I cannot think clearly. I cannot focus on anything. How did this all fucking happen. How did we get here I need to go. I need to fucking leave. I cannot do any of this. I cannot do it. I just went on a terrible rampage and said things to my bf that I do not mean and should not have said. I am pushing him away with every emotional outburst. I am been self harming and all I feel is the sting of my cuts that is distracting me now at least. I do not want to be alive anymore.",1
"Yesterday I was disciplining my son and things were not as productive as I had hoped for. I looked for some support from my husband and his response was - Well, you are being annoying so could you stop. While your at it, why do not you get your car and drive into the lake. You would being doing all of us a favor. I know you are on antidepressants and other stuff so we would like for you stop making our lives miserable if you would hurry this along. I responded to my husband- I am notSuicidal, and if I was, why would you tellSomeone who is to drive their car in a lake. I am now concerned my husband is plotting my death - I know that is a bit extreme- but like I said I am not suicidal but I think my husband wants me dead, and if I do turn up dead, I do not want people to think it was me. I understand if this is not the right place for this but I do not know where to turn. I do not have any friends to confide in but I want someone to know if I do turn up dead it was not me. My husband is playing mind games with me .",1

"There are lots of awful people on internet they just make sitatuon worse. Humiliation, blaiming, harsh criticism exc. I do not get what is their problem.

"I am currently in a rabbit hole of ADHD youtube videos after talking to my girlfriend and her neighbours about it earlier, so naturally, got recommended the videos. Everything relates to me on a personal level that I have listened to so far. Trying lots of different meds and them not working or potentially making you feel worse, could be symptom of ADHD.Constantly daydreaming and only feeling normal when you can find something to hyper focus on, then getting depressed when you get distracted. Procrastinating everything, from brushing your teeth or going to the shop. Doing normal things, like shopping, going for a walk, talking and doing it all as fast as possible.And so so so much more. Yes, I have depression for countless of reasons from my childhood, through school, late teens, early 20s etc etc but the depression is not the only thing that bothers me. I hate talking to people, I struggle to listen, I struggle to get my thoughts out, I struggle to understand that millions of thoughts going through my head every second, I struggle to communicate at any capacity and just many more things.I am going to the doctors as soon as I possibly can and I am going to discuss getting tested for ADHD and other things. I am tired of wallowing in self pity, people not taking me seriously, tired of not knowing what is wrong with me, tired of being mistreated because no one knows what is wrong with me.ADHD is not what most people think it is, the highly active, disruptive troublesome kid. Yes that kid may have ADHD, but there is so many different forms of it. A quote from a doctor is, ""if you have seen 1 kid with ADHD, you have only seen 1 kid with ADHD"". I am not self diagnosing by any means, I am just saying ADHD makes sense to me, and I am going to go out and see what I have. I know it is hard to get the motivation to do things, but do some self research on different forms of Depression, Anxiety, ADHD and many other things, and find something that relates to you, then badger you are doctor or health professional or whatever about what you think and get tested for it. Alot of us have probably been mis diagnosed with a form of depression, anxiety or not been diagnosed at all and we feel like lost causes. I just know there is something wrong with me and I am fed up enough to force myself to go out and pester people to test me, so they can figure it out. It might not be fixable, or manageable, but it may help people deal with me better, and that is better than feeling alone in a room full of people.Sorry about the wall of text. Just wanted to share my thoughts and probably failing to make sense, but I have tried. let us try and help ourselves to at least know what is wrong, then work on it from there. We might all feel alone, but we are not alone. Some people just hide it better or have found a way to deal with it ADHD",0
"Sometimes when I am listening to music that I really like I imagine myself being the person who made the music... I think of how people that I like or important to impress around me would see me and think I was amazing. I think this is a very narccistic thing to do but I have done it for a long time now. I expect so much out of life and reality can never fit the expectation's in my mind. I want love like love in the movies, I want to love and receive love. I used to think maybe I was too pathetic and sensitive for this world but the more I look at myself I realize that I am the problem. I am not a good person, I am so insecure and pathetic that it is dangerous for other people around me. My fears and insecurities are forming me into a terrible person and I do not have the energy or motivation to fix any of it. My mentality is so messed up, I sit here and think nothing I do matters since I can just kill myself. When people push me to get motivated and do something that thought crosses my mind, I think of threatening my life if they try to push me. Of course I have never done that but how long will it be before I do? I sit here day after day reading these posts from all of you guys finding some sort of messed up comfort from others being in my position. Part of me thinks its okay to be suicidal because others out there are too. I could right a book on why I think I should just die. it is like I am waiting for someone else to tell me I can do it. That it is the right thing to do... and even after I post this its possible for my mentality to completely change. I will think no I am worth it no I can do this. But I do nothing to change, everything is in my head. I do not want to do this the rest of my life, if everything is in my head I will only be met with disappointment in pain on the outside. This includes my own actions and mistakes. I just do not think that I am cut out for this world. I do not know anything anymore",1

"i doubt anyone will read this but here it goes anyways. i really thought i was doing a lot better compared to the very beginning of this year. got a therapist, a psychiatrist, and I am on low medication for depression. i even managed to graduate from college with a bach degree in the midst of all my mental struggles. recently i started to get back into past hobbies again too.fast forward to yesterday, when i fucked up my long-anticipated pc build, messing up the mobo and the cpu. honestly it left me discouraged as hell even though in the grand scheme of things, it is not the worst things that could happen, but it seriously crushed my soul and whatever confidence i was trying to build up.now I am re-evaluating my life choices once again. 22 yo guy with almost no job experience at all. kind of decent at web dev but not nearly enough to find a job for it as of now. meanwhile some people my age are out there making a decent living, which is hell of a lot better than whatever I am doing right now. i have some friends but i do not have much in terms of social interaction other than with family members. it is so selfish for me to say this but i just want someone to hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay, but that is not the reality i live in... feeling hopeless",0

Everyone all of sudden has enjoyed online university but I feel like I am stuck. I fell out of touch with people I have been close to ever since graduating since I have been the only one who started university last year. I just really miss people and friends to talk to but it seems like everyone deals with this situations pretty good but I am not? I am really sad and my mental health (I have been struggling with an eating disorder, depression and self harm) has been getting worse over the past few months since I have been really isolated and lonely. Maybe you can share some tip how you have dealt with the feeling of loneliness and also boredom or maybe make some friend in this lonely time. I cannot keep doing this anymore",0

Despite how long I have been in therapy I still cannot imagine my life as an adult, I still want to die. I am getting a lot worse again. I really want to die before my senior year begins. I do not deserve to be alive. I start my senior year this fall and I still want to kill myself",1

I have been seing a therapist but nothing has changed. I have been sh for a long time now trying to feel something. Sucidal thoughts hover my mind at all times.

I am so sick of this shit, i always wanted to date someone but when i get the chance to get into a relationship my anxiety stops me. i hate my life lolll someone asked me out",0
"My life currently is meaningless, my family makes it clear daily that they hate me (do not say anything about that they love me or some shit, you do not know what I have to go through). I have struggled with anxiety since I was little due to my mothers erratic and abusing behaviour and for whatever reason she has not done the same with my sisters. Whenever she goes on abusive rants they both chime in. I am 21 and they are both a little bit younger than me.I met my boyfriend when we were 16 and I love him more than anything in the world and this feeling is definitely mutual. Hes made it clear to me that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I feel the same. In September my friend from university committed suicide and I was completely devastated. At her funeral I watched how horribly it affected her boyfriend and I just could never put mine through that.Having said that, I cannot leave the household I am in. I have just graduated from University and I am still in desperate need for a job but my mother will go through hoops to make sure that I do not. she will scream and yell at me to destroy me as much as she can and its mentally so draining. she will make me feel terrible about not doing anything until I leave or start to clean and then she will gaslight me and tell me I still have not done anything. I end up going to be with my boyfriend but his family have their own issues and I prefer to stay away from that and so do they. This puts me in such a shitty position because I can only stay with them at certain times which means I am home for most of the day. I told her recently I wanted to get help because I want to commit suicide and she told me that it would be too embarrassing if I did either. My sisters love to chime into this sort of shit and it defeats me. My dad is rarely home and cares more about his business than us. I am emotionally defeated and I do not see a point in burdening these people with my presence anymore.

Currently struggling with so much shit. Near Fatal Accident (Head smashed and leg broken), PTSD, Anxiety, Heartbreak, and legal issues (All in that order). When will it end? I say with confidence soon, because I really do not give a crap anymore. I am like a rope on its last strand ready to snap. I am ready for the next disaster. Maybe a meteorite will take me out. Because if this is life, I do not want it. I am confident about it now because I have slumped into the darkness of depression, if that makes any sense.",1
i feel like no one cares. everything in my life is going downhill.i might end it all soon i cannot do this.,1
"I hope this helps at least one person. Losing someone we love is (in my opinion) the worst pain a human being can feel. I could break my leg twice in one day, but eventually, it will heal and I will walk on by. But when the heart is broken, I am not sure if it ever truly heals. I think we simply grow used to the pain and allow it to make us tough. Not stronger, but tough. They say it gets easier day-by-day and that is not untrue, but it feels like they are shrinking an experience so raw and gut-wrenching into something as insignificant as a papercut. I think in many cases when we lose someone without actually losing them, it hurts more than if they were really gone. The pain is unbearable knowing they are somewhere living life, waking up every day and having coffee with someone else, and dreaming of their life without you. it is like staying in a hotel with paper-thin walls, rooming next to them when they are with the person they love and you are in the room next door. Standing on the bed, ear to the wall, alone. Sunshine does not feel the same when we are hurt. Instead of our skin soaking up the rays and allowing them to seep into our pores and giving us sun-kissed skin, they beat down on us and burn us until we are red. Fighting the pain can be just as hard as accepting it. Trying to pretend like everything is okay like we are not hurting so bad that sometimes we wish the sun would not rise in the morning. Wanting to stay in the dark because it is easier than watching something as beautiful as a sunrise leave you every night. But maybe this is a blessing, a sign from the universe that reminds us we are human. We feel pain because if we did not how could we ever know the true immense joy of love? The diving-headfirst-into-the-deep-dark-unknown-putting-our-faith-and-heart-in-the-hands-of-the-one-person-our-hearts-beat-for kind of love. The bitter truth is our hearts may never really be the same and we will walk away with scars. But we have to remember that one day we will wake up and our hearts will hurt less, we will go out for coffee by ourselves and not feel alone, we will dream about things other than what hurt us, we will meet people who love us, and we will experience things that make our hearts flutter. Because that is life. Eventually, the sunshine will not burn us and we will feel the warmth of its rays like a blanket over our shoulders, comforting us as we accept love and pain at the same time. And when the sky fades, a blaze of color will drop onto the horizon, then darkness will fall. And we will not wish for the darkness to stay forever anymore because we can find peace in knowing that the sun will always rise in the morning. just some thoughts",1
I am never really going to be happy with my life and I do not think happiness is something Ill ever really achieve just with the way I am and think and how my life is.

You cannot do what makes you happy. You have to do what pays the bills. Its hard for me to do something I hate every day because the thoughts of this is what life really is and you will suffer until the day you die start creeping in almost immediately. I suffered through shit I hated for five years daily and now I am learning that is just the way life is. I applaud every person who ends it. I wish I was you.

I have saved my fathers life at least 5x recently he just found out hes now diabetic I forced him to the hospital for them to help only to find out his sugar was 900. I was helping him today as I try to make sure he has as little to do as possible. I will not anymore after he yelled at me not listening about it not fitting by instead he calls me a dick head to which I replied with no you are being a stubborn asshole. Thus he squares up starts pushing me wanted to fight would not be a problem if he did not have major surgery on his stomach basically held together with tape. Now I am in my room cannot calm down and my meds are looking like the only way out of this hell. I told him he better never need help again even for health. I have cut ties if I find him on the floor so be it. it was his stubborn ass that put him this situation not mine.

I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop. I am just looking to get this off of my chest - please disregard,1

"Hello dear reader, Today I have been staring at the abyss and I feel so drawn to it, I feel it calling my name softly and gently, I feel like I should just give up. To many bad memories haunt my mind and cloud my thoughts, I still remember the first time I got hit. I do also remember being punched for being gay at the age of 13 by older men in their 18's, I also remember being raped by 2 cops when I was going home from my office when I was 21, I remember swallowing a lot of pills when I was 7 and tightening a rope around my neck when I was 9. I remember loosing an amazing friend one summer day because I did not feel like seeing him at all, because how could I explain that I was feeling vulnerable for the assaulted I have lived in the past, I remember how my father stop seeing me because I was not man enough and I did not know how to catch a ball with my hands, I remember walking home when I was 8 during a hurricane wanting to be blown away by the gusts of wind and I remember loosing the man I loved that die during a tragedy. A man that always told me how strong I was even though I do not have the physique he used to have, he was muscular, strong and kind as a gentle giant, still he always looked at me when we wake up as I was ""Hercules"" or some hero of the ancient times and he used to say: ""My love I wish someday I could be half as strong as you are"". &amp;#x200B;I want to jump into the abyss or more like just stop holding on to life, but I do not want to die. I want to live, I want to leave behind my bad memories and my demons and my errors. If you God can read this I still believe with all my heart in you, I also know that you can see me. And in fact you are right here next to me, trying to reach my broken mended heart. It is silly to think that falling into the abyss will solve anything, but I am loosing my strength I have zero today, my heart is aching and my soul feels heavy and numb. I will not quit on living because I do want to deserve a happy ending, I want to be a nice, gentle man. Not a perfect one, not even a happy one. Just one with a future for me to build, I do not dream about travels, love, hope, boyfriends, friends, videogames or anything at all.I just want a second chance please, I will make it count and I will be humble about it. And that is my letter to you dear reader as you I do try to fight my very own darkness to keep it at bay, so that monster will not swallow me and let me still in my bed while my family sleeps on the same house. I have feel so much guilt in my life for being here, for being alive, for being able to breath. While so many people has lost their life due to and illness or an accident or a murderer. So my brothers and sisters out there can any of you help me lit my light because the night is here and I feel my light dimming and dying out, so please anyone out there.Be kind to me and bestow a little of your light so I can traverse this night and not fall into the void.With tears in my eyes, your brother Alex. Today it is my turn",0

"I do not know exactly why I am the way that I am, at first I would say that I am not depressed I do not match all the symptoms. That was an excuse obviously, then it got worse. It is a mix of shitty days and just being in the same room as my parents. I try hard to tell myself its not my parents fault you are this way but yes they are a big reason and coming to that realization really is disappointing. I do not know whether to keep asking my parents for help or just wait until I am old enough, but I have been thinkingShould I tell my friends? I do not want to force anything on them, or trauma dump on them. I just want to be acknowledged, I just want someone else to tell me you are not okay and need help besides me. I will talk to the wall for an hour telling myself all the reasons why. I want someone to know besides me? They do not even need to help, I just want the knowledge that someone else knows. So do you think I should tell them? Sorry if the formatting is weird I am on mobile! You can ask for details as well. I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, should I tell my girlfriend and friends?",0

"I have been up since 6, waking up early is supposed to help depressive disorders so I have been going to bed early consistently, plus the mirt just makes me pass out so I just take it early. I managed to trick myself into exercising again despite finally feeling low pain but instead of enjoying that comfort I just told myself I have to maintain this work I have been doing with my physical therapist if I want to make that comfort last. Now I have zero energy despite drinking 3 coffees and I hurt again, it is not excruciating yet but it will be in another few hours I guess. I got by just taking tylenol yesterday and using lidocaine patches so I really am improving. &amp;#x200B;I cannot believe I have gotten so many things done recently, but I am overwhelmed by how much more I need to get done in order to truly be happy. After my talk with my therapist yesterday I felt happy, she told me I was taking a very active part in my treatment, I said I am devoted to improving my poor mental health and it made me smile feeling that validation that I am not just going through the motions like I have always done throughout my life. I really had a wake up call being in the hospital that last time if I can just stay on this track I might actually get somewhere in life if I do not fuck up or get unlucky like always seems to happen when I get on track. My therapist asked me how it felt feeling better than I was and I said I just question it, I question if it is going to last. She told me that is just my anxiety talking, she expected that answer, I feel lucky that I connected with such a great therapist this time. Yeah, I am crying right now but I have been smiling more than I ever have, I am doing what I am supposed to be doing, the conventional treatments. Why does it have to hurt so badly? My stomach is in a knot",0
I do not even know why I am posting this. I guess I just need someone to listen. Been suffering lately with very bad depression. I really fear I will be alone for the rest of my life. I have no friends. I have never had a boyfriend. The girl I thought was my best friend pretty much turned on me stopped having anything to do with me once she started dating her boyfriend.I just feel like life comes so easily for some people. Making friends and forming relationships seems like a piece of cake for them. My problem is likely that I do not put myself out there. I go to work and keep to myself with my hobbies when I am home. I am extremely insecure.I honestly cannot imagine someone wanting to date me. I think I am ugly and do not know why a guy would be attracted to me. I do not know how to feel worthy enough to even muster the courage to form a dating profile online.Thanks for reading if you read this. I just needed someone to listen. {26F} Fearing I am going to be alone the rest of my life,0

I want to have the will to live so badly. So badly it hurts. Recently all I have been thinking about is buying as much dihydrocodeine as i can and washing them down with a bottle of alcohol and just sit on the slide next to my house. If i survive ill go on if i do not well thank fuck. The reason i want to live is literally for my parents and sister. The damage it would because them would probably kill them. They would blame themselves. But the truth is its me. Its my fault. I am the reason i am he way i am. Its unfair on them that i do not want any of this. I wish my family just did not want me or hated me or fucking something so i knew it would not kill them. But knowing they love me makes it impossible to go without thinking about what would happen to them. I wish i could just be normal. I wish i could just find the concept of life even slightly enticing. Just a little so i could have the will to chase a life that i would like. But i do not want it. All I have been thinking about is suicide for so long. I think I am going to try and see what happens. Ill roll the dice. Its not fait on my parents,1

"I know it is impossible for me to go back to the past, but I wish I had made better decisions. Some decisions are irreversible, and because of those decisions I am in so much pain. The past me would never be able to recognize the person I am today. I had many ambitions, but now I feel hopeless because everything is fucked up in my life. My self-confidence is at its lowest. My grades are bad, my degree is useless and on top of that I do not have real friends. I cannot believe how fucked up my life has become in four years. I was doing so well for myself just four years ago, but now I am at the worst position possible in my life. Sometimes I really feel that I could vanish and become completely nonexistent. I just wish to die soon and that might be selfish of me, but I do not think I can live with this pain for the rest of my life. It is too much to ignore or even forgive myself for. I wish I could change my past mistakes",1

I have heard there is some pretty great results, but I have also had over 50 courses of ECT as a teenager (i mean hell, I am only 19 now) and that did not have much benefit. In fact, the only lasting effect was intense memory issues. I cannot remember my childhood at all. I am so miserable every single day. The normal treatments just do not work for me. I have got social anxiety and do not have a true friend. The only person there for me is me. If this treatment does not work, I am going to kill myself and I need to mentally prepare for that.

I am scared of death but it is inevitable, so therefore I do not think suicide would be a bad idea, I am just scared. if this treatment does not work, I am going to kill myself",1

"Hey, you all. So here is the deal. I have been depressed for about, let us see here, 16 years at least? Not the most fun process, honestly. It took awhile to get things sorted out for a number of reasons. Lately, though, things have been seeming to actually be not bad anymore, thanks to a 3-month period bupropion, followed by its cessation. I actually have hope for my future, and I do not spend every other minute thinking about what a piece of trash I am in whatever aspect of life I am thinking about in any given moment.The problem is, now I am faced with a lot of emotions that I do not really know how to process. there is a fair bit of sadness at missing out on a childhood and young adulthood that a lot of people seem to get to enjoy. there is definitely a lot of anger at people who either ignored me or went out or their way to bully or assault me. And there is even a bunch of weird confusing feelings that were heavily muted during my long period of numbness, like questioning my gender, that are now asking that they be listening to.The thing is, I am not really quite sure how to handle them? it is like being depressed never really meant I could not feel things, but rather that they were all saved up, and now I am getting hit with them like a tourist in the surf off the coast of Maui. I find myself going back and forth between moments of anger, happiness, sadness, confusion, and exhaustion. That being the case, does anyone have any suggestions for how to process and deal with such a chaotic mess? Oh, and before you suggest it, such a mess is not related to a manic phase or anything like that. I am strictly unipolar, baby.

And I self harm and sometimes I think my sadness has stolen most of the space people have for a personality. Because I am mostly just a paper thin sheet of a person, billowing and blowing away at the seams, where others are 3D and oozing with personality. In all, I feel hallow. Unreal.

Why cannot I just be believed and allowed to transition? Why is it so fucking hard for me to talk to my parents about anything trans related?In the end I just want the suffering to stop. My ex was my world (as cliche as it sounds, I hate talking like this because it sounds so edgy) but seriously. She was the reason I stopped cutting. She was the reason I stopped disordered eating habits. I know it just happened and I can get over it eventually but I thought our relationship would never end.At this point I just want to die.

"In May, I tried to kill myself for the first time but, for some stupid reason, I got help before the pills took effect. I was told I could get the help I needed afterwards, I got nothing but worthless pills. Now I am simply treated like a burden and I fully agree with it. Everyone asks me what I want and get angry when the answer is death. My every waking thought is filled with ideas of ending my life. Its been like this for half my life, I have tried to manage it for my parents, but I do not know how longer I can stop myself. Probably going to try again",1
i was wondering if you could give me some help with this matter...my young cousin is posting some suicidal stuff online and seems to be getting a little dark punk rock vibes only and I am feeling worried about him. i needed help when i was his age because i was severely depressed and did not have any help back then. i used to cut myself and i heard my mom saying that recently he did that too.i do not want to see that happening again in our family and i feel like I am the one to do something about it.any ideas on how to address this? should i talk to him? what should i do? cousin (15m) showing suicidal tendencies,1
"I am ready to give up and as the title says nothing seems to help me anymore. Honestly I have been struggling for so long I do not even know why I have not killed myself already. I have no outlet, no one to fucking talk to that seems to get it. I just want someone not to judge me for once. I feel like such a freak for the smallest of things and I do not know how to let it out anymore....I feel like I keep making the same mistakes over and over again and yet I have no one to let vent to or let out all this frustration and to truly tell how much of a worthless piece of shit I feel likeGod I am so lonely, lonely and tired and yet I cannot even get a God damns night rest anymore. I wish I was not such a fuckinf coward so I could just do the deed and kill myself already..... Nothing helps me anymore",1
"I am exercising, working, sleeping 8 hours, eating more often (I struggle with appetite), and seeing friends... Yet I still fucking hate everything. it is not fucking working and I have been going at it for a bit now. If anything I feel worse putting in this effort but getting no results. I look great on paper but every day is agony. When does it get better and why do people say to do this shit if it does not even fucking work? Is this some joke?? I have even tried to lie to myself and say I am happy all damn day but then I just SNAP because I am sick of lying to myself. I think some of us are just meant to be this way huh? Why will not anyone just give it to me straight and tell me I am meant to be miserable? that is my fucking purpose in life. To stay alive and miserable for everyone else. it is not working",0
"I am a depressed and suicidal man. I am a victim of my own addictions which I was genetically predisposed to!I am going to end my life and read about the quote from Joseph Stalin. I found it edgy few years back.Now it makes so much sense. If I just kill myself, then my problems will go away.*I will not live whole life as a middle class wage employee**I will not face eye problems, skin cancer and teeth decay**I will not feel depressed and stupid all the time*Death can solve it. End of all the problems is death!It is a escape. Throughout history many intellectuals, philosophers, artists and even dictators have described death in their own way..For some people, it is a coward way's out.For some, it is the only way out! The quote ""no man, no problem"" makes so much sense now!",1
"My life used to be ok. Friends, university, life was good. It about ended there after I was diagnosed with mental illness, dropped out and proceeded to waste 7 years until now.I never felt the same, people never used to look at me the same.I recently had a child with a woman who I honestly do not have the emotional energy for.Mom died who was like my best friend.I have been contemplating suicide for the past few years every single day. Through all the years the only thing that kept me going was belief in my capabilities, but now I honestly do not feel like I want to live anymore. I have lost the drive that once resided in myself. I have given up on my fantasy of success. There is nothing that I want in this world anymore. I am pretty certain that nothing will ever make me happy again, no matter how big or small. I think I have been completely hollowed out.Perhaps a last ditch effort can be made by running away, living on the street and turning back to substances. Perhaps it shall invigorate something inside of me again, but I honestly cannot see the point of trying. I do not see the point of having to live anymore.Even though I picture killing myself all day, I cannot put those around me though that. I have just been living with this hole inside of me, getting emptier as each year passes.I feel terrible every single day that I have to subject those around me to my sadness. it is hard because I know they try and are there for me trying to pull me out, I just cannot see any possibility of it happening anymore.I am sorry Empty",1

She does not care, and when she does act like she is caring, it ends up being bad assed. Anywayseeing her happiness is breaking me inside and I just am sick of saying its me being selfish.she is being fucking selfish and my depression is spiking, suicidal thoughts, spikingsobriety, gone.

I do not know why but for about 3 months I have been feeling guilty like I am bottling something up and I feel really sad about it and it is making me feel anxious. I hope some other people have felt this because I find it very depressing and not as happy as I was. Can someone please explain why I am feeling this or if they have felt the same way. I always feel guilty,0

I do not know why I do this to myself. I have been depressed since I was young and recently I have been watching suicide videos and real death/gore videos when I am depressed. I do not like it and it makes my stomach turn but morbid curiosity gets the best of me. Last night I watched them for about two hours in bed and I woke up today filled with so much dread. Its so depressing to see how messed up the world really is and it has me not wanting to be alive anymore and these videos keep playing in my head over and over and my hate for mankind has grown stronger than before. I do not know how to get these images out of my head or know why I decided to watch them. I have seen them before but last night while watching after about two hours I thought I was desensitized but then half way awake I felt so sick when it finally hit me again that these are real people. This is what goes on in this world and now I feel so awful. I do not want to live in a world like this. I do not this this depression will ever go away. I feel disgusted even writing this. Watched death/gore videos and now I am even more depressed.,0

"I do not know really what say other than I am alone and all I can think about is opening my wrists. I do not want to for the sake of my partner and parents but it is all I can think about, and while before the thought of my loved ones grief has stopped me short. But now it feels like I have put so much pressure on them for so long that they do not even realise how tired of me they are. I think the first few weeks might be hard for them, but I think they will bounce back quicker than they think. I cannot go though another year of this incessant and seemingly sourceless pain. Not confident in my ability to hold in.",1
"It all started when I have this dream: basically I spawned in a beach and I had to participate in a taekwondo competition, but before I went to the bathroom and I get lost, but in the sea I see that one of my friends(virtual friends) has make a documentary about interned friends and I was not included, then I retured to the taekwondo thing and when I was about to participate I wake up. This was bascially because one of my friends(my friends girlfriend), we do not know anything about her since october and she was nice, and yesterday I was checking the profile and she made a post in august where it said(thanks for keeping up with me or something like that) and she tagged everyone but me, I think everything is my fault because she probably suicided but at the same time I think its not, I mean, I am very insecure about what to say and what to think, I always regret the idea of being me the culpable, but I live with the feeling, it is probably me at adolescence or that I am very open to people, and the friend that make a documentary has being my friend for more than a year and a half, but the thing that scares me is the fact that she is under 16, I do not know his boyfriends age but he is always saying, for example:-She:can you give me a hamburger? -He:I am not giving you anything, and she is like ok, I mean, I do not know if they hang out like that or it is just me being an entitled parent, I never liked to swear, actually I never swear, and in spanish language we have ""dichos"", dichos are like: I killed 2 birds with one stone, a word is enough to the wise, well we have a dicho that says: it is not your work to fix or solve someone elses life because you are ot enjoying your life, and I am like, yes but no, I think it is only the adolescence because when I discovered one of my favorite streamers I felt a little bit better, but with the dream I remembered that actually my life has suck,I am thinking I am worth nothing, probably because the people around my life suck too, I wanted to try basetball when I was 5 and they told me I was too young, I wanted to try robotics when I was 6 but I was too small(they tought I could not read lmao), my mom says that I am smart, but smart in what, I really do not know my purpose, I had suicidal thoughts(when I was 11), and now I do not want them to get back but it is inevitable, I just hate myself for being to lazy, probably that is why people discriminate me, because I am a fat upset boy that wants justice and is doing whatever to get it, some of my friends suck too, I mean, when they are sad I write the whole bible to make them feel better and they say: ok, you are so wise thank you, and that is all but when I am feeling sad they just do not say nothing, they even not congrat me on my birthday, they prefer the guy that insults them than me, I do not know what I am doing wrong, every step I give 1 is correct and 3 are not correct, I just want to live a quiet life, I want to be accepted, I want to stay well, LITERALLY ONE OF MY ONLINE FRIENDS PREFERS A GUY THAT SAYS ""SEX WITH DOGS""AND HAS KNOWN HIM FOR A MONTH THAN ME THAT I ALWAYS GIVE COMFORT AND HAS KNOWN HER FOR 2 YEARS, probably I am taking social media so serius but they always say, omg you are so smart, but AND WHAT? I do not want to be just complimented, I want a friend I think I hate my life",0
I am living by myself for the past week and I realized how alone I am without people living with me and just solidified my thoughts of being an afterthought. I feel like my friends always invite me last or just do not think of me at all. Whenever I ask them to do something they say no to me and do their own event. Now that I am sitting here in an empty house it just makes me feel worse.Why cannot I just be okay? I want a life where I am not constantly depressed or have someone to at least help me out sometimes.How do you cope with depression when no one is there for you? Why does depression like to hit me worst when I am alone?,0
"So, first of all, I am a 21 years old guy with Asperger's. I have been depressed for a few years because of how I feel that everything that happens to me is my fault. I have a really high amount of self-hate because I do not like anything about me at all. I think things like I am ugly, short, and a shitty human being. Over the last few years, my life has become worse and worse. I have failed my last year of highschool for 4 years in a row. I do not have any friends at all because I lost them slowly. I have also been in a few relationships, but all of them ended badly. At first I thought all those things were because of bad luck, but now I think they all were my fault because I am a piece of trash.I am useless at everything I do, like, I am not good at anything at all. I have been trying for a long time to make friends by joining groups and using chat apps but I always end up either fucking up, or not getting an answer.I do not know what to do at all anymore. I hate my life so much that I want it to end. But I am also too much of a coward to end it. Everything that happens in my life is bad, and even if something good happens, I end up fucking up after days or months. I am tired of being alone and always fucking up everything.I just want to have friends and live a happy life, but I feel that it will not ever happen because I would fuck up again and again each time. I have been feeling worse over the years and I do not know what to do anymore.",1
"About a week ago I started my first real letterbut then I stopped. I finished it tonight. it will still be a couple months before it is all said and donelogistics.I have struggled with suicide all my life. Even made some attempts when I was young. When I met my wife over a decade ago, I thought I was okay. That I could keep all the abuse boxed up like I was taught. What they do not teach you is that life keeps happening and more bad stuff gets added. My box overflowed and I lost my way.Then I lost my wife. My light was gone. I did my best to carry on and even though she did terrible shit, she gave me enough hope at reconciliation that I started to get better.Thenlifeand lifeand more life. StillI persisted. Things got better. I got stronger. There was still hope.We had a date last night even though I am sure she would not call it that. It was great. We spent the night together. She cuddled for the first time in months. I stayed awake all night.The wheels fell off this morning and throughout the day. I am not putting them on again. I am getting off the ride. The hope is gone. She will be a widow before she can divorce me. I am leaving her everything. She will have more than enough for a completely fresh start. It feels like the best gift I could ever give her. Freedom from me and a new beginning. The feeling is oddI think its peace.SometimesI think some of us are damaged so much that without whatever source of light in our darknesswe just have to let go. I hopein timeshe and those closest to me will realize that this was not selfish, but instead selfless.I love you. The Reckoning",1
"I will try to keep my story short; but I am also venting.My partner has suffered from depression for most of her life. She has endured child sexual abuse and never healed, and every time she got hurt throughout her life it just deepend that wound and reinforced the idea in her mind that people are abusive and out to hurt each other.Because of certain events her depression has gotten worse throughout our relationship. At first it was anxiety attacks, or perhaps she hid the other stuff from me then. Now I can see she is worse than ever after a relative died. She feels she is a burden to everyone, and mostly, she feels there is no hope, that she has been suffering like this for decades, and that there is no hope for her to ever get better and live a normal life.Her average day is being constantly on edge and scared of everything. I can see in her eyes she is just exhausted. Some days she just lies in bed, stiff as a board just looking at the ceiling and crying repeating ""I do not want this anymore"" over and over softly.Recently talks of ending it have become somewhat frequent. I cannot force her to go to a health clinic, and I am in that situation where if I call them to pick her up she will not trust me again or experience it as another betrayal. In the end they will release her within a week or two and it all starts again, but then I will not be near to support her and that might be more dangerous.The other side of the coin is that I am also just a human. I am overworked, I get tired, I get annoyed sometimes. it is a lot to carry for me and I realize I am just not everything a person with severe depression could need. I am not always soft and understanding, I am not always right there to hold her hand. I feel for her, and this situation is in my head all day every day, but selfish as it is, I am also at that age where people generally go through a lot of big milestones and I have plans and goals for the future and they are all on hold. Even though her safety is more important right now, I do feel frustrated because it feels like my life is so uncertain and stagnant.I just do not know what to do or how to deal with this situation.I do not know if I am even a good thing for her. Sure I comfort her when she has anxiety attacks, and I do what I can to be supportive. But the very fact that we have a relationship is also putting pressure on her. She feels like she is not a good partner, like she is ""withholding"" sex from me. Like she is taking away my chance at a good future. Even though I try to tell her that is not the case, she still feels like that. The sex is a non-issue. She is not a bad partner because she is going through depression I can live with all that. Underneath she is an amazing person that I love to spend time with. But she is right about the other thing, I suppose. What if her depression never ends? What if truly she cannot ever overcome it and live a somewhat normal life. Am I a horrible person for not being able to see that in my future? I have had that feeling for months now. I do not tell her any of this, because that is not something she should carry now. I am kind of just waiting it out and trying to have a good relationship and hoping that she does get better at least to some degree, so that those feelings end up irrelevant.I have so many emotions and most of them conflict some way or another. I do not know what to do anymore. How to care for someone on the edge?",1
"I work alone overnight and I decided to *not* have my headphones in for my nightly dose of escapism this time and to just let my thoughts wander. In the past 30 mins I thought about all the things that make me miserable (my self body-image, the fact that my bf and I have nothing in common, the fact that my parents only want me around to use me for favors, being unemployed after having been fired from my career job, how easy it is for me to fall into a toxic binge drinking spree, and my sick dog as well as the existential dread that comes with acknowledging how quick a dog's life is ) And I also thought about all the things that make me happy (My body when I treat it right and exercise, the fact that I have a bf and someone who loves me, the fact that both of my parents are still around and I can visit them, the freedom I have from not being stuck to some shit career position I actually hated, how much fun I have when I party with my friends, and how happy my dogs make me when I see their faces first thing in the morning)And it made me realize that everything in my that makes me momentarily happy or miserably depressed are two sides of the same fucking coin and I am so sick of this game. it is a game I will never win. Nor do I care to at this point. If it was not for the fact that I damn well know I will be traumatizing those who care about me, I would get drunk, blast my favorite 90s alternative metal song, and drive off a bridge. I just talked myself in and out of suicide in the past 30 mins.",1
"Lately I have been finding myself drinking more and listening more to music with suicidal themes, like the MASH theme, or Ozzy's Suicide Solution, to name just a few. The last time I came down with major depression I spent two and a half months with hardly any food, and went 2 to 3 days at a time without any water. While I am not starving myself, I am certainly not eating as much as I should. People say if you just go outside, or just go to work, or whatever, that these problems will go away. No, I have done all that and they are still here. People are fucking idiots that do not know anything. My latest fantasy involves getting into a scrap with an armed robber at the place I work. In my fantasy I win the fight, but with mortal wounds. Been feeling incredibly down lately.",1
"it is hard to wake up and do anything. I keep trying to tell people, but everyone is always busy, and none of my friends and family listen. Everything always makes it seem like if you tell someone you want to die they will get you help, but I literally said that to my mom and she just told me to ""be more positive"". Like I literally do not know what to do anymore. I do not want to be dead, but it is the only way I can think to stop the pain. The thing is I am sure if I did die everyone would care, but I hate that I cannot get help without doing anything major. I feel like no one cares until you actually die",1
I feel so scared. I do not know what to do with my life. I feel stupid and pathetic. I have low self-esteem and every time I feel anxious I tend to have suicidal thoughts.

"I have been battling ""The Big Sad"" for about 15 years now and I thought I was doing better. I stopped self harming, I had overall happier thoughts and did not even really want to die anymore. But lately, my suicide thoughts have gone from bone, to passive, to aggressive. I have been lying to everyone about how I feel just so they do not have to deal with the burden of it, I bought knife blades for the first time in almost a year for the sole purpose of using on myself just to feel SOMETHING!! I know my life is falling apart and I do not really feel like there is anything I can do about it. Almost every shower I have I come out of it with a new mark on my body. Almost every thought is how swiftly I can disappear and make sure no one acknowledges it. I do not know what to do or even what I want. I feel like my identity has been stripped away by depression. I have been a bad person",0

"the worst part is i cannot even tell if I am faking it or not. it does not feel fake idk. i broke up with my ex girlfriend several days ago because her mental health was starting to affect mine and we did not have a healthy relationship. its just when you love someone so much that its hard to see them like that. but throughout our relationship i found my self in really depressive states and when she was contemplating suicide i did too and that started to give me suicidal thoughts and they have not gone away. i do not think i would ever do it, i want to live. but what this relationship has done to me is mentally and physically drained me. i know I am not the only one who is drained, but right now how I am feeling is that the future is useless. i know how its going to end. I am going to meet someone new, fall in love, get a dream job, get some cats maybe, but is it really worth it? because i cannot even explain what the next few days are going to be like my last relationship has made me highly depressed and a bit suicidal",0
"She has made my life a nightmare and I am not sure what to do. I love him and I am not breaking up with him but she has gone completely crazy. She keeps yelling at me, said I was trash and mentality destroying her son. It has gotten so bad to the point of her yell at me calling me fat. Her calling me fat has made me stop eating almost all together. She blames me for her 18 year old son not wanting anything to do with her. I have started struggling to get out of bed. I sleep when I do not work and cry every single day. This maybe nasty but I have a hard time keeping up with hygiene sometimes. I have even stopped taking my meds because I have no energy to do it. My boyfriend's mother is crazy",0
"Unfortunately, I am 17F and three months away from turning 18 I do not expect medical advice but just to rant. A year ago I was in a psych ward after a previous attempt of suicide and I was assigned to see a therapist since I got discharged and I had multiple fucked up episodes since, the most recent one costing me my job temporarily. I was out of work for a month my therapist told me it was likely I have bipolar disorder and assigned for me to see a doctor the next month. We do not have a car so my narcissistic father had to take me but told me he could not take us (he did not want to do it because I yelled at him for yelling at my mother for asking for financial support and saying that that is exactly why he left her). He refused to take me after waiting a month for care because I ""swore"" at him for blaming us for his bullshit narcissism. He said to my mother until I apologize for my actions he is going to stop taking care of me (dental needs, doctors appointments, etc.) My mom does not believe in medication and I am not really a fan either, but since bipolar has been pointed out to me the hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, impulsive decisions, and suicide attempts, make sense because of the dramatic shifts in my moods a few times a year. I believe I am manic at the moment because my decision making gets waaaaay more fucked up than usual and I am loud, fast talking, energized, and have not slept for more than 5 hours a night and now I am not sleeping at all regardless of 9 hours shifts at work. I only have insight now because it happened to me so many times. I am really irritable at my mother because I have to be like this because until I am 18 I have no say in my care. She does not believe in medicine and I do not like medicine either but I do not want to be like this anymore. She calls me dramatic when I feel like I am going through hell in my mind. Everyone just feels the need to call me a bitch:Me: *Did not sleep AT ALL after closing at work and when I almost had a remote chance at sleeping my niece starts screaming her head off*My sister: *who recently shit on me for crying about a recent miscarriage I had at a baseball game and asking to go home when she wanted to see fucking BIG AND RICH (lmao) literally yelled at me the whole time for asking to leave in front of zillions of people starts hissing at me and blaming me for waking up her child when she was clearly already awake and screaming when I got up*Me: *Pissed because of this*My sister: ""you are SUCH A BITCH!"" Then there is my mom:Me: *exhausted but cannot sleep due to the episode*My mom: ""Take out the garbage.""Me: ""Okay.""My mom: ""I said do it now! I do everything around here and you just lay there.""Me:*did not sleep after work, just hates life in general and does not want to react the way I do but she keeps freaking out* ""IT WILL GET DONE I PROMISE YOU!""My mom: ""You always say that. You always have to have things done your way."" *Proceeds to threaten to call my dad or someone to yell at me*Me:*Yells expletives out of extreme anger, starts screaming and covering ears because of sensory overload, and BEGS her to leave me alone because NOTHING would be more relieving at that point*My mom: *Walks away* ""you are so dramatic.""My mom does not get that I have a disease in my brain. She makes me live like this and it makes me so angry when she says stuff like that.My dad in a nutshell: *Is bipolar himself, narcissistic, and blackmails me for taking care of me*I hate it when people try to tell me that it is because I am ""a teenager"" I want those people to go to hell. I have tried to die 3 times, cannot function without a stimulant, lost a child, was shit on for having feelings about it, have abandonment issues because of my dad leaving when I was one, forcing me to be in this world with these problems and then replacing me AND HE STILL does not LET US FORGET! LOL (not to mention people who have called me a mess and left and used me on a romantic level), have three current diagnoses already, and if I express myself I get called a bitch or ""Somebody has it worse""I am done.I feel like genuinely crying but my moods will not let me. I deal with manic episodes and I am called dramatic by my mother who will not let me go on medication *Not as long of a story as it looks*",0

"I have been researching NDE's (near death experiences) and suicide methods for weeks. I read dozens of accounts of NDE's to try and piece together what happens in the afterlife. From what I gathered most people who died felt at peace, but the few who ended up in dark places stuck with me and now I am afraid to kill myself but I still desperately want to die a peaceful death. I figured I would dedicate my life to making others feel good so when I *do* die I am in a nice place. But I cannot even do that right.

I am broke, my business failed (which was not my fault) and do not know how to function in society anymore. I have things going for me, but nothing makes me happy anymore and I do not have the same drive that I used to.Anyway I ordered my supplies only to find the gas I planned to use is diluted and likely would not kill me. Now I am annoyed and embarrassed that I have a useless tank in my closet. I know what I want...to die..but with the unknown and the pain I will because I just do not know what to do. I want to kill myself, but I am afraid of Hell",1
"I feel like everything in my life is going awful. My grandpa died last Monday, and while we all expected it is hurting more than I thought it would. My grandma then had to go to the hospital and I have been worried sick about them. Right before all this, I moved away from my family, and I am living with people I do not know at all. I feel isolated and alone here, but I moved away because I felt like I could not stay in my tiny house with my parents. I knew there was a risk but I thought there would be a better reward. So I am alone and grieving. On top of this, I am struggling to be productive for my job and I feel like a failure. The girl I have been seeing is suddenly being weird and stressing me the hell out right as I wanted to move to the next stage with her. Stuff keeps going wrong with my job. Lastly, I am terrified I have a freaking STD. She and I are not exclusive yet so she did not cheat on me plus it is one of the ones that they do not always test for. I feel so overwhelmed and I feel like it will only get worse when this girl inevitably picks someone over me...again.I am a good guy. I am nice, decently looking, good in bed, considerate, smart, and interesting. I am not a ""nice guy"" who thinks he is entitled to women at all. I have just been mistreated and hurt so much. I have a combination of awful luck, bad taste, and overeagerness that has kept me from having a romantic relationship. I want to kill myself before shit goes sideways with this girl, before I have to face the fact that I am a failure at my career path, before I have to deal with my Grandma dying also, and before things get worse. I feel like things are only getting worse. These issues probably seem stupid and trivial, but I cannot handle them. All I want is to be loved and I feel so alone. I have dealt with depression for years and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder when I was hospitalized two years ago (after a summer almost in the exact same situation as now, but better). I am just so freaking tired. Even the fact that Reddit is being glitchy as I type this makes me want to jump in front of a train. I wish I could die without guilt. Like if I died saving someone or just dropped dead. Everything is just so overwhelming This is the lowest I have ever felt",1
"I am absolutely exhausted and I cannot deal with any more people. Right now I locked myself in my room with my knife ready. I do not know why I cannot use it anymore, I have used it plenty of times before. I am drinking so I have the courage to actually do so. Maybe it is because I will not feel the pain as much, maybe it is so I will not feel this small feeling of hope I have found recently even if I know it is not going to work out. I do not even know what I am trying to achieve by writing this, maybe I just want some attention, I do not know. What am I doing?",0
"I am tired of having no friends.I am tired of the toxic, abusive home I am trapped in.I am tired of my job.I am tired of my health issues.I am tired if every day just being the same numb, repetitive bullshit that never seems to end.I wish I could find the courage to die. I am too far gone to save from this hell on earth. I am tired of everything",1
"I have died 1000 times. And yet I still wake up everyday I am good at putting on the mask, pretending to be okay. 7 days a week, 12 hours a day I am usually a happy guy. I know I fool most, anyways. Then the night comes, and with it solitude. I do not have to worry about worrying my loved ones or upsetting them.I can tear myself apart, piece by piece. I hate myself. I hate my face, i hate my body(I am working out, trying to change), I hate my personality.I hate how I make my friends feel. I used to be able to make them laugh, but now I am not funny. No one believes a word I say, and I do not blame them. I am a liar because I am to afraid to be hated or not accepted.I wish for death to take me every hour, an opportunity to sacrifice myself for good. I try to make changes, but they never seem good enough. They are not acknowledged. Not by me or those I love.Every night I die, and every morning I wake up disappointed that I did.Thanks for reading. Needed to get this out, the mask is starting to slip. Stay strong guys and gals An interesting title",1
"I feel that I am at the end of the line. Every fucking day is a dread. Stuff is not interesting. I am so irritable and annoyed. I cannot care for anyone and it hurts because I want to care. But I just feel damn empty inside and want to disappear. My dog suffers because of my depression, my relationship too, my work. Nothing is untouched by the emptiness and the disease of depression. Can it ever stop being this way? I have tried and tried and feel stuck. Help please. Please some solace, a break, progress. Something that can help me hold on and keep going. Empty and irritating days, every day",0
"I am working my butt off to earn but still it is not enough. Problems shitting with me every now and then. Been hustling like a bee. Resting is a luxury. I am tired. I just want to rest forever. Trying my best, but still not enough",0

Ever since I was a teenager I have battled suicidal thoughts. I thought by the time I was at this stage in my life Id be happy. I am on the right path and look like I am succeeding on the outside but on the inside I am struggling again. I am 22 and I do not know how I can live the rest of my life feeling like shit no matter what I achieve. My boyfriend does not even know my past or what I am going through and he never will. I cannot stop the intrusive thoughts or the outbursts of anger. The worst is the embarrassment after I have a meltdown. I get so emotional and angry and I cannot help myself. I just need someone who can actually understand. Does it ever get better,1
"so I am 14 and right when 2021 started, i moved schools, i was pretty sad mostly because i would not be able to talk to my friends in person and stuff, but i stayed positive. for the first couple days nobody talked to me, and I thought that was normal because it happens often, but they will eventually talk to me right? and so these first days became weeks, then became months, and I have been in this school for 7 months and I have no friends, I have tried to talk to people, which is really fucking hard for me, I am really bad at socializing and talking to people, and whenever i talked to someone, i feel like they just talk to me out of pity, I have just been really sad, my parents do not take it seriously, and i do not really have anyone to talk about this with, I have thought about suicide, I do not think I would ever actually do it, but I think of it alot and I really hate the fact that nobody takes me seriously on this, my mom thinks I am doing it for attention, and my father thinks the same. I think I am just not a good person to be around, and I just felt like saying this to someone. sorry if there are any typos, my country's first language is not english. just felt like saying this to someone",1
"they did not die or anything and i actually think they are doing well. they just left me. understandably bc i do not know how to deal with my shit or how to communicate in a healthy way. but like, i fucking miss them. and i wish i could reach out but i cannot bc i think they are doing good and i do not want to ruin that. F you C K i miss my best friend.",0
"I have tried to kms a multitude of ways in the past and i know i have a mood disorder or issue and my therapist does too i just have not been diagnosed yet. i want to be anywhere but here i need to die I am so manic rn I have been high for like two weeks now and I am 16 and feel like I am deteriorating, I have been stealing money for weed from my mum but idc she is rlly fucking abusive i just want to be anywhere but here i feel so alone i do not know where to go",1
"I have tried every medication available, been in therapy for years, nothings helping, in fact its only gotten worse. I do not know what to do now, do I just wait for a new med to come out, it it even worth it? what is the next step from here? Suicide?",0
"I have had depression my whole life. Tried every medication. Prayer. Church. Counseling. Nothing works. Recently went through something is that have left me completely broken. It hurts to breathe. And I am so tired of being hurt and in pain. I am sure 100% I want to die because I do not want to continue suffering anymore. I have no desire to live. The problem is I cannot seem to find a way that is quick and not traumatic. I have been physically abused a lot and I get horrible anxiety when I am afraid and anything harmful to myself is scary and sends me into panic mode. So jumping off my balcony, hanging myself or cutting my wrists is not an option for me. I have tried to take like 24 Percocets hoping Id fall asleep and never wake up. But I woke up. I guess it was not enough. And I do not have access to any more pills. I wish there was just a way to disappear and it be done. Anyone one else stuck in this position. Life is over but you cannot find a way to leave or do not have the courage to do anything traumatic. I want to die but I cannot find the courage to kill myself",1
"My mental health has made me so scared of myself - I do not want to be me. I do not know how to describe it, but my depression really overrides my body and mind and I, like a robot just follow it. My bedroom had gotten really messy so a few days ago I built up the courage to finally try to clean it. I knew I did not want to do it and the fact I even did made me feel odd. As if I was shocked I got out of bed. So I am cleaning and doing pretty good and all of a sudden my brain was like nope I really cannot do this anymore and I just shut off my bedroom lights and went to bed and I had never just said fuck it like that before. Since may I have been getting really in to spirituality and focusing on myself and connecting with the world. Yes it made me feel amazing. I really feel I transformed. Except as of lately I am going back to old habits I finally stopped during that time. I become a bitch to everyone, I have attitude for no reason. No but the worst part is the worthlessness I feel. From age 11-22 I do not think I have ever not had suicidal thoughts. Well in May-July I really was so high on spirituality and accepting the world around me. I honestly did not have bad thoughts come in to my head. But as of this week I am back to the same shit. I cannot get the imagine of cutting out of my head. Or other methods (I have always imaged a rope or g*n but know I would not use one method and I could never buy the other). And at this point it does not feel depressing it feels annoying. Like my depression is taunting me like hey do not you still want to do this. And the answer is yes. I have derealization issues, I have self worth issues. I have a hard time accepting I am alive and its just a lot to deal with. Before May when I had these thoughts I believed them. I still believe them but this time I know its more a mental illness and not my souls desire if that makes sense. Like a heart attack is the hearts issue but the heart did not do it on purpose its just an inconvenience. I do not know if that makes any sense but basically I do not want to be a human anymore I do not want to daydream violent things, while also struggling to accept I live in reality while also trying to be hopeful its all too much Becoming self aware",1
"Wish i was cherished and cared for, not taken advantage of, not taken for granted. A lot of things really left my feelings hurting. Ultimately I have nobody. Everybodys gone. cannot love. I do so much for certain individuals and they will come back to bite the hand that feeds them. Sickening. How do these people interact and live like this. I do not even feel emotion anymore after being hurt so consistently over and over again. I am at the point where I just do not care what happens. I am lonely hurt and pained on the inside. Wish somebody could just help. Wish I had a faithful loving women to help me out this rutt. Fucking hell, I grind so damn much and life does not progress. I pray to God things change this year. So sad at this life man. Another lonely day of bottling my feelings. I must sound like a little bitch from how much I am complaining, but gosh I never ever ever vent. So it kind of does feel better. From the bottom of my heart, I hope you are all living happily and fulfilled. I turn 19 in two hours, not feeling it though",0
"Hi everyone. I am a 23 year old male nurse that has been working for three years now. I was diagnosed with Major Depression while I was in High School along with anxiety, and Tourette Syndrome. I have been battling suicidal thoughts ever since then and I have been hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric facility three times. I cannot remember if being inpatient actually helped me though. I have been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a little over a year and have had two acute series done. The ECT has ruined my memory and it does not seem to be helping any longer. I had a treatment done on Monday and was already feeling severely depressed and suicidal by Tuesday night. I do not know what to do.I could commit myself again, but my brother's white coat ceremony is coming up and I need my PTO to be able to fly out there to see it. I also do not want my family to worry. I love them and they are the only reason that I have not killed myself yet. I also do not even know if its worth it. I have been inpatient three times already and the suicidal thoughts are still there. I do have a couple of good things going on in my life though. I have a great job and a extremely loving family that is almost always willing to put up with a call from me because I know it helps my depressed mood. I have told everyone that I talk to regularly (my brother, sister, aunt, uncle, Dad, and Mom) that I have been feeling down and that talking to them helps improve my mood. However, I have been struggling with the feeling that I am starting to call them too often. I just do not want to bother them. To make things worse, my therapist is currently on maternity leave. I have a substitute therapist but that just is not the same. On top of my depression, my anxiety is so severe that I am unable to make friends. I have not had a friend since high school and that was only because I was friends with my twin brother's friends. I just get so flustered when I am around people that I can barely talk. I have no work friends, they all just know me as the quiet guy. I do not know. Everything just feels like too much. I am so tired and frustrated. I am just ready for everything to be over. I have feel like I have been suicidal for most of my adult life",0
"I have been on anti depressants for the anxiety benefits because I have constant heart palpitations when I was not on them, apperantly from anxiety.I am on metfromin for my diabetes and I am in trulicity, an injection. I found out without insurance the injections are 900 dollars for a 4 week supply. I pay 27 dollars.I finally can afford therapy too. I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now.But every day I have to work my job, the attacks are coming back no matter what I change my depression meds to or higher dosages. I have been thinking of suicide, so much I have started fantasizing and plotting it.I have started making plans of getting rid of my cats and my things. So it is all taken care of ect ect.But... I do not have to die. I could quit. I could find another job. One that... does not give me amazing benifits... and I cannot have all of the medical help I have now...But what if I found one that did not make me want to die?I have been holding on because I think the medications might be the only thing stopping me from ending it. Without them, I worry I cannot do it. I... am wondering how hard my life would be if I quit my job.",0

"Yes I am probably crazy but read if you would like. Maybe I am not crazy whatsoever, maybe the intelligent man simply sounds like an insane man to the less intelligent. Who knows. If a society wanted to put a cap on the capabilities of its inhabitants, it could hypothetically be entirely possible with psychological barriers. Say a society wants to ensure that nobody gets too smart, or enlightened for the liking of the simulation, a swift dose of nihilism could put a stop to the inhibitions of the intelligent in order to ensure that they will not destroy the simulation. A perfect citizen is ignorant, therefore they can slave their life away to the world as they know it, rather than asking questions about that world. If somebody becomes too enlightened, they will not have the desire to slave away for the machine the way they know it to be, rather they would attempt to dissect the irregularities and analysis regarding their existence. As its commonly said, ignorance is bliss, and if you are ignorantly blissful you are not posing a threat to the simulation.What if depression was able to be weaponized in some sort of manner. Instilling a hopeless state of despair into those who pose a threat to a society would ensure that they would not hold motivation to genuinely embark on anything seriously threatfull towards the norms of the machine. It is insanely implausible, but entirely possible, that the simulation we exist in utilizes depression and nihilism as psychological maneuvers to maintain a functional society. If you want to put a stop to the inhibitions of any threat, simply red pill them. Once they reach the nihilistic realizations of reality, they will likely shut down. Psychological weaponization of depression",0
I am tired of feeling this way. is anything real? am i real? are these my hands? i wish i could sleep forever. I am going out tomorrow to buy a blade and I am going to start starving myself again to cope. why was i ever born if i was going to be living like this? i just want to sleep forever,1

I am sick of constantly having nightmares of the sexual abuse that happened to me. i can always remember it in vivid detail and it makes me sick to my stomach. i do not want to remember any of this anymore. i just want to die so bad so i do not have flashbacks and nightmares anymore. sick of reliving it all (tw: sa),1
"I cannot take this anymore. The anxiety, the stress, the feeling of hopelessness, of loneliness. The smallest thing set me off and makes me want to end it all. I try to talk about my feelings with others, but I just end up scaring my friends away, and making my parents mad. I just end up getting into fights with my loved ones. I want to kill myself so badly, but I do not have the courage to do it and I feel bad for my parents. I have thought about jumping from the balcony so many times but I think about my family discovering my corpse and I just cannot do it.On second thought, people say I am just too entitled and I make things up in my head, that is why I do not make effort to get better.

I am just stopped having that self pleasure and that false feeling of having a loot of partners to fuck, maybe I am a little more healthier now, but not more happy so what is the point?Maybe I should keep watching porn, anyway it is impossible for me to even talk to a girl, and after all the porn I have watched I do not think I can even be satisfied with a normal relationship because I was into hardcore stuff.I am sorry if something here does not make sense, I am not a native English speaker, just wanted to vent out here where nobody knows me.

What do you think the easiest way to do it is? Without your raw human survival Instincts to counter it? Cutting your wrists and throat I feel like can back forever a gun pulling away at the last second. How many pills and what kind would you need? Do you need to mix the pills with alcohol? How strong of a rope is needed to hang? How small of a room do you need by sticking your head in the oven?

"I have been wanting to be dead for years. Just waiting and wanting. Just because I have some good moments does not change all the bad I do. No amount amount of good will change the bad. No matter how hard I try to better and even if I seem to be better it is just a matter of time before I revert back to the monster I am and seems l'll always be. I am pushing a boulder up a hill and no matter how close I get to the top it rolls back down, I just wish it would finally end me for good. Why does dying have to be hard like everything else",1
"I would not say I am often just super depressed or in agony, though lately I am pretty damn sad and hopeless. But mostly I am not constantly suffering horribly or anything. But. If life does not work out, if its more effort than what I get in return, I do not want to keep doing it. At my age, its unlikely to change substantially. And sure, it could. And I could expend a lot of emotional energy, time, effort, money, whatever, to try. But more often than not, when I have made myself keep doing that, it has either returned nothing, and I just lost time and money and happiness and confidence, or the bit of positive was not worth the effort. I stumbled onto something (someone actually) that was worth the effort. It was and is pretty new, but in just a few months we connected to the point it became genuine love. She wanted to see me, talk to me, be with me. And I felt the same way about her. And the rest of life felt lighter and more enjoyable because of it, like even those other things felt worth the effort. Something happened that changed her. It was mostly my fault, but I still have a hard time seeing it as something that should have completely changed how she feels about me. We still talk and have been seeing each other occasionally, but its not the same. She does not seem excited at all to see me, or talk to me. We only see each other when I ask to see her. Anything romantic, flirtatious or certainly sexual seems to have stopped. I am still in love with her. Its really hard to let go when I know she wanted me just as much before, and since I am still the same person she loved. And since it took this long in life to meet someone like that, it just is not likely to happen again. If I lose one of the very few things that was worth the effort, I do not know. I just do not want to keep doing this. I cannot leave though, because I have 2 kids I really care about, and they love me, a lot. But Ill just exist for them, just a she will, dead or dying inside but pretending I believe this is all worth it, for their sake. It does not have to be a solution, it can just be a choice.",1
"I am a 33 male and I have a fiance with 3 children (step children) We have been together for 4 years and in most relationships we have had our ups and downs, especially when we first started dating it was really rough. In the beginning she was extremely tough to deal with, but over the past couple of years she has calmed down a lot. Even though she has calmed down and not as toxic as she used to be it has left me in a state of depression/resentment for her to a degree. Lately I have been drinking more, engaging in more risky behavior with my kink, smoking more to the point where I feel like I need to drink/smoke more to feel something besides feeling empty and guarded. Yes, the cheating happened a year or so ago especially when she told me she cheated on me with 5 other people back then all because of me enjoying my kink alone with out her (which is an object, not an actual living thing/person). I work, cook, clean and she rarely does anything but lay in bed and mosey around the house to check on the kids, but not much else. She has family and female friends she hangs out with but not very much. I do not even have close family or friends to hang out with anymore. I used to love playing video games, but even that is hard to enjoy anymore.

"I grew up in a very abusive household, and my friends also hPpened to be physically and emotionally abusive narcissists. So when i was 15, my father saw i had a few cuts on my arms and his response was to yell, ""wtf is that. (I replied with, ""stress"".) *he then gets right into my face*... STRESSED, I am THE ONE that is STRESSED. I WORK ALL DAY, I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT BUISNESSES I DEAL WITH. IF YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN, you will FUCKEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS"".Since i was a child he is been training me everyday since i was a kid id go to wwork with him, untill i started school. Then it was jist the summmers. And then it was weekends and summers by the time i was 12. I jad become severely overweight and only haad 2 physically and emotionally abusive friends. By the time i was 14, i was essentially running one of the buisnesses myself. Yet he acts like i have all this fucken free time to do everything he needs when I am trying to have my own life. He goes, ""you can do whatever you want"" but then also forces me to work under him, and underpays me when he finally made me become an employee since we were lacking manpower at the time. Anything I have ever said was ignored, constantly belittling. All i feel is emptiness at this point. And finally realizing that my friend was a fucking sociopathic rapist. I mean i always new he was a bad person but i never fully understood. I have a very child like, bubbly personality ehich was just ripe for abuse i guess. I may have bpd, i need to see a therapist but i really just want to give up on life. Idk. I am 24 now. I finally kicked out the toxic ppl in my life after starting to find my voice but I am still stuck with my father because of work and while it seems like hes trying. It also seems fake whenever there is an actual problem he reverts back. The amount of gaslighting, manipulation, scapegoating, belittling, bullying I have taken. I have so many stupid storys like being ditched, hit, picked on, played with by friends and family. And all i did was take it because that is all I have ever done. And i was yelled at otherwise. For fuxks sake, I have been ditched at a piehole pizza because i had the keys and my friend had the food, i went to unlock my door, he saw and rushed at my with his fist in the air ready to punch me, i flinched and tossed the keys over his head. It fell and broke this plastic compass his father got him. His mom and dad divorced. because from what he told me, he was an alcoholic. But they still see eachother alot. And seem to have a good relationship. Idk. My friends never really told me anything about their lives. But it broke and he freaked out, got in the car and drove off.

Talking about it here is a huge step for me. The last few days were terrible. For the first time in my life, commiting suicide became something I could do.

Seriously fuck this world and fuck god and fuck whoever is responsible for this. Fuck you for making me suffer so much without telling me why. I am so tired guys,1
"Is been a while since i posted and left the things halfways. I explained how I was forced to quit from a well paying work and have been unable to recover economically since. I have severe trust issues now and have become very bitter and cynical. Last time I also told you about how i started wandering alone afterwork looking for troubles until i was finally assaulted and went so far as to goad my aggressor to pull the trigger on me. So I started therapy. I was still being somewhat supported by both my exs, one helped me find a place to stay and try to recover enough to find a job again and the other one lend me her shoulder and listened to me whenever she could, i was grateful for that. Then the therapist made me realize a few things. First of all that i was right to be depressed, my story was harsh, and she was amazed i went for so many years without looking for help. I told her that i already do things to stave off depressions since i sculpt, write and do digital art as a hobby, but lately that was not enough, i felt and i still feel like i do not get joy from it anymore. She suggested we started with telling her about myself, about my relation with my family, with my friends, etc. So it turned out that i was not only depressed but had repressed over 20 years of anger, since i always acted as a mediator or a problem solver, i barely ever let out my anger be shown. I have adandomnent issues because of a very traumatic episode that ocurred when i was five and is something that keeps on dragging with both my ex's leaving me at some point, although both cases were amiable enough i got hurt and moved on or tried to move on. This feels like senseless ramble, sorry. So i quited my job on the call center. I move cities again and had to stop seeing my therapist because of money being short. I started working at a winestore and i kept bashing my head against the boss's. He was an idiot. I also understood that i have a very difficult time working with people face to face. I am not only assertive but also quick to lash out against costumers and the boss if i feel atacked somehow. I left the place after a year, they did not fire me because even though all the fights, i was a good worker, and one of the few that did not quit after 2 weeks of work because of it being too hard. I left on my own volition after a discussion about the contract, and since i was a petty jerk y waited enough to time my quitting with the holydays, so bossman would have to cover my absence himself. Just after quitting, i got on a fight with a close friend, and my landlord decided to evict me just because. Actually i know the reason but since the place was offered by a ""friend"", i took it at something they would go ""backsies"" later on. Trust issues, man. Since i was getting evicted i stopped looking for a job, took my stuff and returned to my folks places, which does not make me happy. I was wanting to burn my savings on the therapy again but i felt bad about using money while not having a job, then covid came and jobs became more difficult to get. One of my ex's finally decided to push me into drawing lewds for commission. It was an old idea i never truly tried because I am not comfortable about it, is not something i like. But my regular art never got attention. With her help i created a super corny/girly/nonethreatening handler for deviant and off i went to draw shit for other people. She just asked me to never show her the stuff, and i could comply with that since i m not comfortable letting anyone else that i know see it, although close friends have been warned. I started to get some traffic, with it some commissions. I started saving money again, and thought of calling my therapist again to see how we could work into improving myself or my life, since i ve never stopped having suicidal thoughts. Then my ex let me know that she was having a hard time being there for me, she made me feel as a liability and cut contact with me completely. And i had a meltdown, she had been my closest friend through the whole ordeal and now she leaves. So instead of calling my therapist to improve myself, i tell her i feel miserable, wronged, sad, and still want to die. I want the pain to stop, I am more scared of keep hurting than of died, a week before a roof almost fell over me and i did not even react. I am numb to that, but i do not like hurting I am tired of that. I am tired of this, so why should i drag this on? And now I also understand that I feel emotionally alone, and even if a stop feeling hurt, that will not change easily. TLDR: random rant and followup to last post. My world just got smaller (follow up)",1
"I feel like I have made a similar post like thisprobably titled the same thing too. But I just wanted to say that I am tired. It seems like such a simple thing and I am not one to be cheesy about my sadness so I am not going to do one of those soliloquy type things. But I am tired. Lately I have been sleep a lot, I have got my period today, and I am just not interested in much. I blocked my friends one day and i did not even have the energy to add them back. Even worse, I did not miss them I have been reflecting on myself and why I am the way I am and why people (in my personal life) dislike like me or are deterred by me and I think its because my own behaviour. Perhaps I am disgusting. Maybe I am weird. To go off topic here, I think I am a pathological liar and I need to get help. Again this is completely unrelated but its just the fact that I know there is something wrong with me I just do not know for sure what it is. Even seeking help from a professional puts me nowhere because ultimately its just an inference. Psychology is nothing like being a doctor and performing surgery. Yes, being a doctor is based around making an educated guesses, but in the end there is always a right answer. One that is more commonly or usually found out as opposed to cases where they are not.

"the title basically says it all. i do not want to exist, feel, be alive anymore, yet the thought of what comes after death terrifies me. I am so extremely tired of feeling the way i do everyday, when its bad all i want to do is be gone, but, that fear of what comes after consumes me each time. i do not know what to do anymore, i feel trapped, hopeless, i do not know what is left for me. i do not want to be alive anymore, but I am scared to die.",1

I try in vain to combat this feelings, but life just keeps letting me know it is all futile. This existence is agonizing. This life is daunting. I have nothing to hope for, nor nothing to keep me grounded here. it is amazing I am not suicidal yet. I have absolutely no idea why, when all I get is shit. Everyone around me has a plan or some semblance of happiness. Yeah they have have their problems, but they somehow go through life making it all look so easy. Meanwhile here I am, this sad and pathetic sack of useless flesh. Why the fuck am I still here? I am reverting back to my old, depressed self and I just do not care anymore.",0
"In September I was finally planning a wedding with my SO (the person depressed) of 3 years. He spent weeks picking out the perfect ring, and he even picked out a house to buy for us. He was going to put the deed in both of our names, but take on the loan in his own since I did not graduate with my doctorate until this May. Fast forward to February when his family fell apart when his Dad (and his best friend other than me) hurt his mom (in addition to other difficulties in his life not involving me). It was like someone flipped the switch off in his brain. He said he felt numb. Like a piece of him died inside. It continued to get worse until it felt like he hated me. He said mean things, would hang out with people he never hung out with before and seem truly happy, but when he got home he was emotionless again. He did not talk. He lost interest in sex and if we did have sex it felt cold and emotionless. He assured me he still loved me but it did not feel like it anymore. In the first week of May he seems to perk up and finally opened up about feeling depressed and I left for 2 nights to go visit family and he went right back to numb. I texted him and went off because I could not take it anymore and asked him to fight for me but he said he could not. A few days later he told me we fell out of love. I recently heard about anhedonia and it seems consistent with a lot of his sudden actions and ability to have excitement with only some people. I do not expect to get back together, but some kind of understanding of an issue that I do not understand or personal experiences would be appreciated. I am struggling but in a different way. I tried to be enough, but I regret not realizing he may have needed professional help. I know this is for those with depression, but I could use some advice",0

I do not want to grow old. I am 18, and I do not look forward to the future. I have already had health problems and I do not want to face the cancer, or the wrinkles, or the arthritis that I know will come along with aging. I do not want to see what my future is like, because this feeling is inescapable and I know that I will always be miserable. the only thing my future has to offer for me is an apartment in NYC that is too expensive, a cat that I bought that I am sort of afraid of, and weeks, months, years, of this horrible feeling. I do not want to live to see that.there was tragedy that put me in this place, but there have been some extremely lucky things that have happened to me recently. my full ride scholarship. my escape to college this fall. I thought Id be happy for once. bur the momentary relief was just that. momentary.

I hate my job but no one wants to pay me as much with the same benefits or they are looking for someone else. I work out and do hobbies all the time yet I am out of shape and still feel stressed. I feel paranoid and cannot trust my family or friends as I feel that they only talk to me when they need something unlike me who checks in on them just to see how they are doing I mean phones work both ways.... It just seems like nothing is working out no matter how much I try or burn myself at both ends I feel exhausted and do not even know why I am doing this anymore. I do not even dream anymore my sleep consists of a short few second black void and then I wake up to go through my daily drag everyday. I try reaching out to my so called friends and family and I just get a ""oh I am sorry"" or generic ""are you ok?"" With no follow up and my family just seems to downplay it by telling me how much worse they have it and why I should not he depressed. I just feel like a wreck small things set me off from people rushing me to even seeing couples in public.

I just lose interest in everything. I need suggestions on how I can be more patient and figure out things for myself.

Maybe, its just sad to be alone. Like no one to care how you feel, but when I know that their day is a little bit off, I tend to ask them if is there anything I can help them with.

"4 or 5 years ago I went out into the freelance world after a series of full-time positions; I gave myself a year to see if I could make it work and thanks to a few series of good connections the ball kept rolling. Most of the work I was getting was unexciting but hey it paid and I was ""living the dream"" as they say. Well here I am still taking on the work that gets passed my way and while the checks have gotten smaller, I have managed to be a bit smarter; instead of trying to buy my ""happiness"" I have started saving and doing the responsible thing...have even managed to get a car, a nicer apartment, and long term girlfriend (hooray for me). The only issue is, I sit here now and feel as though the job I work in, I no longer have excitement of motivation from. I would be lying if I said I have that positive feeling from anything in my life outside of a brief flicker from time to time. it is really hard as I see, in this area, so many of my peers that I began with excelling to new heights where I feel like I am pivoting in the same place. I know the things that need to be done in order to move ahead but truly I feel stuck in quicksand; the idea of ""doing the work"" seems so daunting. I am looking to have the ""spark"" in an effort to begin the process but I know that is unlikely to be the way things work out in reality.

"I do not know why. Maybe I do.I hate commanding people, I really do. Whenever I do a task or a chore at home, someone comes up to me and tells me to do it right before I got to work, I give up, and I lose my hope entirely and coddle myself back in my room. But people who are commanding in a sinister way motivate me. My brother told me to kill myself, and he is such a loser for saying that, I will never do it. My parents say I am a failure, and that is their belief, in my mind I am a winner, and I will keep winning. My friends hate me, so I improve myself on my own time. I write, I think, I do anything I can to keep my mind running because my mind is both my enemy and my friend. it is a ticking time bomb of both self-hate, loathing, hostility, and creativity. Sometimes I am energetic, I write a lot, and sometimes I am not, and I break down into my old ways of doing nothing. there is so much to do and so little time, that I have to rush it out, I love talking to people and arguing. it is kind of exciting, like a high instead of doing drugs.But back to my point, rude people motivate me. Because to be rude to someone who is been nothing but accepting and understanding, who loves you near unconditionally, is the most pathetic thing you could possibly do. So, I am above you. It motivates me.What motivates you? Surely there is something right? Just think about it for me, for yourself. That helps. Rude people motivate me.",0

When I was in school I took gcse re and one of the topics we covered was about suicide and also assisted death. At time I thought suicide was bad because that is all we hear and are conditioned to believe. However in re we were looking into different religious beliefs and of course all the religions say suicide is bad but the teacher showed us a clip of a woman who was a suicide advocate and (Id like to add I was not suicidal or depressed while at school) I thought she made some really good points. Of course at the time I did not make my opinions known because everyone in class was saying how she is wrong I was only 15 at the time and did not want to be made to see some stupid school councillor or something so I kept my opinions to myself. everyone is argument against suicide in that class seemed so stupid to me after hearing what that suicidal woman had to say. I understand that when people die its sad. Extremely sad when its a close friend or family. But dying is inevitable so why are non suicidal people so against suicide? Id rather die on my own terms. I am extremely depressed and suicidal and I feel as though I get emotionally blackmailed to stay alive. I might sound naive but I rarely ever hear people telling non suicidal people to please stay alive. Like when my dad was just randomly dying from a heart attack one day I did hear my mom say it to him but is she angry at him for dying even though she told him not to? No and that is because he had an illness which caused him to die. I also have an illness and that illness is depression which is pushing me closer to death just in this case its me wanting to die on my own terms? I know my mom would hold some sort of resentment towards me if I were to die by suicide. At the end of the day all deaths are sad and upsetting no matter how the individual dies so why are the people who are suicidal the ones who are selfish? So I have to stay alive and suffer just so you do not feel bad and get your feelings hurt? Is that not selfish? What is the difference between dying by choosing suicide and dying naturally?,1
"I do not know when it started but I found out that my father and all of my relatives in his side do not believe in mental illnesses. It was in 8th grade when I started showing signs of depression and I got into this ""rebellious"" phase, this is also where he started texting me how he will beat me and wished that I was never his daughter because I was not normal. He was not in the country at that time so he was not able to touch me. I never told my mother, I felt like nobody could not accept me and it affected my performance in school and my relationship with other people.Fast forward, at the beginning of my time as in 11th grade, I was diagnosed with depression and I even had to lie to some of the doctor's questions so that the results will not be worse. I was given a letter to see a Psychiatrist and now I am about to start college and I still never went. I still remember how my father threatened to beat me and make sure that almost all of my teeth fell off if he finds out that I have not been acting like a ""normal teenager""I had a fight with him again this quarantine and even though I am agnostic, that night I thanked God because he was not in the country and he was not able to hurt me. He kept saying that I was a mistake and an embarrassment. Everyone in the family just excused it as his ""way of saying he loves me"" because he just ""wants the best for me"" and it is just because of ""high blood that he could not control what he says""I want to run away. I hate everyone in this house. And even though that my mother is the only reason I am living, I hate her the most for letting him treat me like this. For a woman who showed me how strong she was by not relying on my father's money and embodied independence, she is the weakest person ever.Until this day, I have never heard an apology from him. Only material gifts which was his way of saying ""you cannot hate me, I bought you this expensive item""He poured his money on me while I was growing up and I hated myself for that because now I cannot even stand up alone in the outside world now without finding them and relying on their ""help""I am such a failure Parents that do not believe in mental illnesses",0

"reccently i read over some messages between me and a previously close friend from a few years ago. during the messages i was going through a depressive episode and we were talking about it together. however, the messages i sent were kind of toxic and i was being very unfair. she was trying to help me and i would reply with k or refuse to say what is wrong because it does not matter. i would also send worrying messages and then not reply for long periods of time, which would make them very anxious. i do not want to be the person i was in those messages, normally i would consider myself to be a kind and friendly person, and id like to think that I have somewhat improved in the last few years, but I have been noticing that during depressive episodes i have a tendency to regress to this blunt and rude way of speaking to people. i know that depression means you cannot feel as much for the other person, and it definitely makes you feel like no one else cares, but i do not want to use it as an excuse and continue to treat my friends badly. a lot of the time i do not even realise I am being like this until afterwards, but I am appalled by how I have acted. i would appreciate if anyone has any tips to get themselves out of the nobody cares about me attitude, or any similar experiences.many thanks my depression makes me into someone i do not like",0

"I live with my parents (16) and I need to find a way to make it so they will not know for a few days. Thinking of saying I am staying at a friends house and going off into the woods, give them a fake address for my friend because they do not have any connection to them. Also do not want my friends to know but the only ones my parents are able to contact also does not have this friends address. I want to kill myself tonight, problem is I have work in the morning and it would be so fucking selfish to leave them short handed. Maybe tomorrow night, then. Any other ideas to make sure nobody knows where I am for a few days? Hoping to OD on caffeine pills, how to make sure parents do not know for a few days.",1
"just over a week ago, a good friend of mine killed themself. they would been struggling for months, but it still was not exactly expected. wed talked less in the past month or so, but we still were super close and it devastated me to hear the news of their death. after the grief set in i remembered that wed made a promise nearly a year ago, that we would stay for each other since wed always be good enough reasons to stay around. clearly that worked out for us, and it reignited my own thoughts of suicide. they broke our promise, so what is stopping me? I have seen our friends handle their death so much better than i expected, so how bad could one more be? I am just stuck i guess, and pretty much the only thing keeping me here is all my fears about dying (but not the death itself, long story short) with my friend gone, i do not have much keeping me around",1
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO ME Going to kill myself,0
"I would rather work then be bored at someone is house doing nothing. The 4th of july was shit everything is shit I look at amazon store and its so small and boring how is it defeating malls and markets? What an underwhelming simulation where donald is president, corona exists, and i have to witness the collapse of economy and happiness I was brought in this world with no choice and forced to live by human nature and society If assisted suicide existed in this dystopian society economy and ignorant people will be disrupted. why should I keep fighting? I just want to work and maybe do some drugs and blow my brains out man. I mean i do appreciate what mental hospitals can do but how degrading, costly, and boring that would be as an adult. I feel like as an adult i have to make my life or take my lifeTheres no point to anything My Rant",0
"Honestly I thought I had my shit together. I was diagnosed in 2018, so I decided to take a break from uni. Got a whole lot better, like I stopped having panic attacks, no longer hated to see my reflection in the mirror, no longer sleep excessively. It was a good year of rest, and then I decided it was time for to continue uni, and I needed to do an internship because it was one of the graduation requirements. Never would I thought that this internship was going to be the reason I relapsed. Basically it was the only position that was available for me, the other places rejected me. I am only required to do a 3 months internship but they requested it to be 5 months and I accepted because beggars cannot be choosers. Little did I know that this place was a shithole. Communication was 100% online yet they will not let join any group chat regarding any project whatsoever because I am an ""outsider"" and ""temporary"", yet they also throw their responsibilities to me without warning, I am not given any mentoring whatsoever. I am a graphic design student, and I feel like i have lost all sense of good design because my department head keeps requesting outdated design and honestly they do not make sense. I have been pestered by a coworker about the project that she dumped on me without warning. I have been humiliated in weekly meetings. I am losing sleep and losing my patience, and most of all I lost my self esteem.I only have like 5 days left till my internship is over but every waking hour is like hell. I cry in the shower, before I sleep, and before I start work. Lately I can barely get up from my bed, make so little progress for work, and now I panic whenever I hear my phone notifications go off because I am afraid of what my coworkers would say bout my work. Plus I also only get paid 1/10 of our minimum wage, and i use that money to pay for my internet plan so I can work online, so its basically unpaid internship. If any of you are beaten down so bad by your surroundings to the point of depression, I understand. I have supportive friends and I can barely go through this shit. If I faced this alone, I am pretty sure I would have disappeared to a neighbouring town and change my identity, and made sure no one will ever hear from me again. I swear I am this close to giving up Depression relapse",0
"I know no one is going to read this so fuck it. In my life no one cares for me my mom died almost a year ago and I did not even get to say goodbye. My dad basically killed my mom. He would beat her every night, most the time because he was bored. I could not help my mom I was too young to understand. Then he would beat my brother he is only three years older than me and he now has ptsd from it he is scared to talk to people and sometimes gets to nervous to even talk to me. And now my dad threatens to kidnap me when he gets out of prison. I have to live in fear that my dad is going to break in my house kill my family and take me. But no one cares. I stay up late at night out of fear of dying. And suicide is what I think about all night. Who cares if I die. No one wants me no one loves me anymore what do have to live for. I do not know there is my story I guess if anybody wants to even read it I wish someone would care",1
"Just hurts. I get invalidated for this too all the time. "" no ones ugly, just be confident "" bla bla bla.. man. I was a very unattractive kid so I was always rejected. It made me be super quiet and its permanent. I am so damn anti social now. I am so shy and socially awkward no matter how much I practice. On top of it depression takes away my personality, libido charm etc. 11 years of this shit. there is nothing desirable about me. Sure I workout but it will not fix my bad qualities. I have given up with women I mean shit I already know life is not fair its cruel. I feel like I am 95 constantly depression is not fair I really hate being unattractive",0
"Well SuicideWatch, been thinking a lot of doing suicide, but when i think things are shit, they just get a little bit better and that is fine, i think. they have never let me do anything since I was 8, no friends, no hanging out with friends, that stuff. My friends had to move somewhere else and then i was all alone for 5 entire years, on high school i made a couple of friends, most of them leaved them because different reasons, money, they died, etc. I got into a fight and i almost lost my eye. I live in a ""box"" since I am never allowed to leave out of house, just to go to the market, or when i go with my grandma, etc, but after that, nothing. On Preparatory (Higher than high school, at least on Mxico) i made a bunch of female friends, just for the 1st semester, and then, all alone, again. My parent's marriage is tearing apart, they shut between themselves a lot lately, like for a month or so they have been so toxic. Tomorrow my grandma is going to have a party and i bet they will get mad at each other. I want to escape, i do not really want to commit suicide, not even if i do not even feel pleasure from jerking off, etc, i do not feel any pleasure from it, i never feel ""happy"" just when i play with some friends online that i constantly get yelled at because i spend a lot more time on the computer lately. I would really love to leave my country so i can start a new life, i have even tried getting a ""sugar mommy"" so i get out of the country, yet it have not happened. But this suicidal thoughts started since i was 11, when my little sister was born, my father loves her a lot, she even gets more attention from my dad, making my mom angry and viceversa. I do not really know what to do, i do not feel pleasure anymore in almost anything, no joy in anything, i just feel sadness, anger, sometimes i feel ""horny"" but that is it, i have dated online a lot of girls, yes, but in the end that maked me feel even worse, i never had a true friend or a real girlfriend, nor anything. I would use some kind of advice, thank you. Another suicidal thought",1
"Hello everyone. I am new to this group. I am 19 in UK and I have been dealing with depression alot. I was first diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety and depression a few years ago. And I have recently just come out of an 8 month relationship. I use to lean on her a lot for support for my mental health and now she is gone I am kind of stuck. I do not really have anyone to talk to through out my day. I have my mum she is my best friend but Id like to have someone I can make friends with and i can just make general conversation with. My lifes just a constant up and down spiral. If anyone has any advice for me please let me know. And go easy on me lol. Any advice to get over a break up too would be appreciated. Thanks very much. Need someone to talk to",0
"Not sure if this is the best sub for this but I still think it is a good question.As someone who perhaps is not as socially skilled as it should be, I watch a lot of self-improvement/social skills videos. The advice they give is ""say the things you do not think are worth saying"" or something along those lines to keep a conversation going. But my problem is I simply run out of things to say, good or bad, and I totally blank until the other person picks up the conversation.Is this something any of you relate to? Running out of things to say",0
"I spent the last 3 weeks feeling suicidal. I have sever bipolar and ADHD which do not mix very well. I finally got my ADHD meds approved with hopes of helping me, when I learned that my grandma stopped her cancer treatment because they discovered her cancer had spread. I am going up this weekend to see her, but its only a matter of time If its not one thing its another",0
"I am not looking for sympathy or kind words. I just need to briefly open the vent that I so frequently forget is closed.Have you ever seen one of those charity coin spiral devices? You would put a coin in, and watch as it spirals down. It would go slowly at first, then pick up speed as the circumference becomes smaller and smaller, until an audible chink, and then silence. It reminds me of a black hole - a one way journey to the centre. Well I am somewhere on that spiral, maybe not at the bottom, but far from the top, and past the event horizon from where no matter returns. I guess in a sense we are all on that spiral, but I feel much further down than I should be at this point. As I sit at home on my computer, slowly deteriorating, having been to therapy twice and both times removed from the service for missing appointments, all that was interesting or exciting is blown away by the most gentle of winds, and all that remains is an empty she will of what once was. I am, by choice, disconnected from society, and I despise the human race and the brutal foundations it so delicately rests upon. I have problems with my stomach which mean I have such little energy that everything feels like a lot of effort, and I am in pain most days. The doctors cannot find anything wrong, and I have given up trying to find an answer or a cure. I loathe everything about myself, and by everything I really do mean e v e r y t h i n g! From the way I look, to the way I interact with people, to every nuance that defines who I am - an incomprehensible number of variables. As I do not like interacting with people anymore, and having largely withdrawn from society, I have also begun to neglect my hygiene and my health. Every day feels like groundhog day - waking up and maintaining myself for nothing, just to live another day in pain, a pointless expense of energy which I can no longer afford. Many days now I eat one meal per day, and struggle to find the energy or will to have a shower and take care of myself. I am beginning to be able to describe myself as Christian Bale from 'The Machinist', but less productive - at least Christian goes to work every day and forms some type of relationships. I eat when my stomach allows me to, I sleep when I pass out from tiredness, I wake when the birds become too loud to ignore, and I leave the house when absolutely necessary. I feel sorry for anyone that I befriend, as I know I will lose interest eventually, have an episode where I do not want to talk to anyone, and will inevitably just stop talking to them altogether, so I have stopped making new friends as it is not fair on them. I infrequently talk to the one or two I still have, and make excuses often for why ""I cannot talk today"". I struggle to make long term goals as I do not see myself being here long term. When I think into the future, I see a make-believe fantasy of what could never exist, nothing even remotely tangible given reality as it is precursor, and so I prolong my existence with video games and make-believe - a distraction, a way to delay the inevitable. But as soon as I exit the video game, the day dream, the false fantasy, and remove the veil of distraction, I am thrown back into and reminded of the world in which I am expected to be happy, in which I am expected to be grateful, a world that I am expected to enjoy, but do not. Every day I see the spiral steepening, and feel my speed towards the centre increasing. I am not sure when the slope of the spiral will become to steep to maintain my spin and drop me into the darkness of the unknown, but I am slipping. A Spiral Into The Inevitable",0
Anyone else ever get envious when they drive by a cemetery? I look at all those headstones and think dam I want one. Envy the dead,1
"I do not want anyone telling me not to do it. If you came to lift my spirits you can leave, I just want answers. My mom has a bottle of Lisinopril that will last a month, would I die if I took them all? How much Lisinopril is deadly to a teen?",1
"People keep saying if you want to be happy, you can be happy! Well, I want to be happy, but what should I do first? Because doing anything, going anywhere only feels it adds more weight on the sadness and depression. I feel safest to hide in my bed. I just slept 20 hours today and still feel tired",0
"I do not care that I am LaZy. I have been trying to restart my life for 7 years and my life now is only shittier than it was when I was 18. I have excercised, dieted, got hobbies, gone to therapy. All of the things the drones constantly drone at you in these forums with their insipid generic platitude. I never succeeded. I always failed, and each time stepped my face into the dirt once more. I do not believe in myself. I have ZERO self esteem. Since I was a kid, I have had nothin to be proud of. Horrible hand eye coordination, always picked last in sports, ooor academic performance, socially clueless. I hate myself. But more than that, I despise everyone else. I want to go on a msss shooting and massacre a bunch of retards so that they will will feel terror and pani, and maybe it would be cathartic. You are all so lucky I have not been able to get my gun license. I am poisonously envious of anyone with something I want. Intimate relationships, friendships, money, a degree, independence, respect, charisma, beauty, youth. If you have one of these things, the best I can do is feign indifference. I cannot pretend to be happy for tlothers any longer. I wish them only the worst. I do not care about fairness. I do not care about who earned what. There is no such thing as deserve in a deterministic universe. I repeat, I would love to horribly injure and ruin peoples lives, not because they deserve it, but because it would be cathartic for me. I would especially love to stab every cunt who has ever yttered the phrase pull yourself up by the bootstraps or other such normie fucktardstion. I am not interested in fitting into this society. I want every single person to die, and for no more to come afterwards. Ah, that would be an antnatalist paradise. I am done fighting",0
"why am i so damn misrable, i have everything i want. but I am still sad. I am so tired.i just want to lay in a hole and fucking die. the person id normally talk to is gone for the week with family, and everytime i try and talk to one of my friends they put me down by either saying they have it worse or completely yelling at me for not considering how they feel. i should not feel sad. i should be happy. i constantly think about suicide. why does everything have to be so painful. vent ig",1
"I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 12. I have been on a dozen anti-depressants, with no luck. I have been on anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety, and I am currently on my 17th ketamine treatment.Nothing is stopping them. I think about killing myself nearly every second of everyday. I have been in an inpatient facility before, and that was terrifying and actual hell.I just feel so lonely. I have an amazing support system and a great husband, but sometimes it is not enough to make me want to stay I am just laying in my bed thinking that it would be so easy.",1
"i live through pain. i feel like the living embodiment of pain and trauma. but something gives me this drive to overcome it. i feel like I have been through the most. the only negative thing *i have not* experienced is the loss of a parent/homelessness or severe physical/hospital pain. everything else mentally, traumatically growing up i have experienced. and i have lost family. being in pain puts my feet firmly on the ground and for some reason makes me see my reality exactly as it isonce there; it can only go up. because ultimately my mind forces my body to do any and everything to avoid thinking about the thing causing me pain its got to the point for me where i actually thrive from being in pain",0
"When you are outwardly chipper and the folks around you do not know or would not understand what you are dealing with, It makes you feel even worse when you cannot talk to anyone about how long its been since you have bathed, brushed your teeth, or changed your bedsheets. And your apartment is so disgusting, you could never have anyone over. I can go to work although it is a challenge, but when I am not at work I am in my bed watching true crime shows and crushing candy on my phone. kind of sucks",0
"Part of me is thankful that I was not able to successfully do it, the first time I was so numb after it happened, I fell onto the floor and hurt my knees and wrists... but the second time just earlier this week I was really upset afterwards, and I called a hotline, I did not tell them what I did because I am isolating due to covid and did not want to go to hospital (not sure if I would have even been allowed)I have been sleeping for the most part for the past few days, but maybe all of this is telling me that I should just try to survive... and that is what I am going to do, I am still dealing with a lot of ideation but I am going to keep practicing guitar and see how that goes. Self harm is still a big issue for me that I need to sort out as well... I survived two hanging attempts this month, maybe a sign..",1
"I have bouts of depression (mild to moderate says my therapist) but my wifes is much more severe. She has suicidal ideation and emotional dysregulation. She has a history of trauma much more horrific than anything I have experienced. So I spend a lot of time trying to support her and be there for her but her situation leaves her unable to provide me with any support during those times I need it most. I do not want to be one of those what about me? husbands, but the truth is that I have very little time for self care and certainly no one to lift me up when I need it. Like I said, I have a therapist, but I do not contact him outside of my bi-weekly sessions. How can I be there for my wife if I cannot get my own help? What do you do when your partner is worse off than you are?",0
"I am too much of a coward to cut my wrist, jump off a building or use the rope. The fear of surviving and ending up needing support for the rest of my life from a permanent disability horrifies me.

I feel so bored all the time and am too tired to live sometimes. I try to jack off but the pleasure only lasts so long. I feel like finding love would fix me but no one is nearby. I used to have joy in gaming but now it feels like a chore. What do I do? Honestly just bored with life.,0
"A ramble, sorry. I have no friends, no family, no life, no job, no hobbies, no money, and most importantly as of right now, no health insurance to get better to possibly get help to fix myself to have these things. If I cannot get therapy or medication or psychiatric help then nothing matters. Everyone throws around get therapy when someone is struggling but not everyone fucking can, so stop telling people that, its infuriating. A huge debt and hospital bill will probably make me want to die more; so? I am paranoid all the time, I cannot stop analyzing every single thing to death. I do not think right anymore. thought negatively for so long I believe it. I do not think people can change, I try and try and I keep going back to how I was. It has to be untrue that you can get better because I have done so much and I am not. I am miserable, I am sad all the time. I do not care about life. do not care about even finding something enjoyable to do because I just do not care. I do not care about any of the things everyone else cares about (family, career, hobby blah blah blah) I do not believe in purpose or meaning because we are just a bag of cells, some hyper intelligent apes that just run around a world that tells you how to live and defines you based on looks, money, success. I am extremely self conscious and insecure, I have tried every single thing to fix this and actually for once like myself but you cannot do that if you actually do not like yourself, can you force yourself to like someone else? No. So why should I force myself to like myself when I literally cannot because I am hideous and disgusting and getting older. We used to not live until we were 30 before modern medicine and such, but now we are prolonged to live until we are seen as worthless. Ageism is a thing. I have suffered with anorexia for 8 years, I was abused and neglected as a child and then abused again at 19. I am 22. I miss being young as well, I hate that I am 22 and I do not want to age anymore I rather die young than die old pissing myself in my diaper and being alone. I never leave my house, I hate people so very much. They seem selfish, dangerous, and I cannot relate to their minds because they operate correctly and mine is going a million miles a second. I think deeply about thinking deeply. I am scared and anxious so much from everything and trauma its physically effecting me. I am fatigued and sleep and act like I am sick. Maybe I am sick but cannot afford any medical care!!! I hate my body, face, hair, and skin. I hate my personality, my voice, my thoughts and thinking patterns. My family is gone or have been the reason of how fucked up I am. My friends hate me and moved on years ago. I only have a SO and they are why I am here today. But, my insecurities and jealously is ruining that too. I am not good enough in so many ways, I am so miserable its showing up everywhere and again there is no help for me. I cannot even afford sliding scale help or any of the fucking rest. My sleep is not even restful as nightmares haunt me daily and make me wake up so so so sad. God, I wake up sad every day. My body hurts, my heart is broken. I just do not want to live here anymore but I really do not want to hurt my SO, but I have been so strong for so fucking long just for my SO, but I cannot take it anymore I cannot do this anymore and I cannot breathe because of how much I hurt. Nothing can help at this point I am seriously too far gone. I cannot function at all, I cannot socialize. I do not want to live poor anymore because I am too anxious for work, I do not want to live. I do not want to die either I really fucking am scared and terrified of death but the pain I feel the aching dull feeling of despair in my stomach is just too fuckingr much right now. I am safe right now but I am writing this out because I lurked this sub for so long and I wanted to write 10% of what is going on and figure out what to fucking do from here. I do not think I can keep going for another year. Nothing can be said",1
Life is a fucking nightmare. I have not gone a single day in 2020 or 2021 (so far) without seriously considering killing myself,1

"For the past 4 years, I have felt either flat out nothing or panic. I do not know what is wrong with me, so I would like to get checked out. Yet, I am just a minor and I really do not want to make my parents upset. Back in middle school, I harmed myself. Not too long after, my parents discovered self inflicted cuts. They asked me what I was so upset over. I could not answer them. The truth is, I could not really pinpoint what made me do it. I lied and told them that people were talking behind my back. They did not really take it seriously. They just told me that I should be grateful because I had a roof over my head and a good family. The school therapist did see me a few times, but it did not help at all. If anything, it made me feel ashamed of myself. Even earlier on, a teacher thought I had ADHD because I showed little interest in class. My parents ignored it. Everyone thinks I am doing well off because I get good grades and I am good at faking a smile. In reality, i do not know how much longer i can take any of this. I either feel nothing or intense dread at times. I am constantly hoping that time will pass in the blink of an eye. I am working so much that I feel like I am on autopilot. I do not feel like myself. I do not even remember what my personality is supposed to be like. I barely have any friends, but i think they are losing interest in me too. What should I do? Any advice helps. Thank you. How do I ask a family member for help?",0
"I was first prescribed SSRIs when I was 8 years old. I was poorly adjusted at a charity boarding school in eastern Vermont. I had what could be described as behavioral issues. I was sent to the school by my uncle after my mother and father had been sent to Federal prison following convictions of conspiracy to traffic controlled substances in 1998.I did poorly with my school work despite intense remedial tutoring. I had difficulty socializing with my peers in a respectful and productive manner. I was always in trouble.I was removed from the residential school in December of 2000 and taken off my medication when my behavior became too disruptive and the treatments for these behaviors became ineffective.I was to attend a public school my grandmother's hometown in Southern New Hampshire. I lasted there no more than 2 weeks before I was asked to stop coming while the school district would draft an IEP and send me to a biological education facility.I was sent the following school year to a school for kids a broad range mental health issues.I was there from 2001 to 2006. It was like an alternative school the teachers were specifically trained in crisis response and non-invasive restraints.I was to attend monthly hour-long meetings with a psychotherapist employed by the school. Overtime I learned to regulate my behavior but the mood disorder never went away.I had never gotten passing grades in school and saw no future there so I dropped out at age 16 and got an equivalents diploma. I had no direction as a teenager no goals no guidance. Still mentally ill. Still no solution.When I turned 18 I joined the army I had to do a lot of lying to get in. I should not have passed my eye acuity exam due to having an exotropic strabismus (crooked eyes) I figured out how to cheat the tests. The army specifically does not let you join if you have history of mental illness. I scored well on my ASVAB and chose the MOS 68W Medic.I struggled through basic training, for the same reasons I struggled in school. Despite not having depth perception and double vision after six attempts I qualified as sharpshooter to pass basic. The physical demands also took me longer than most people in my unit. I did complete basic training without remediation.I was then sent Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio Texas for combat medic school.It was the hardest thing I have ever done. I passed all my qualifying tests first time despite seeing so many fail out of the school.I was then sent to my unit.there is a good reason the army does not want mentally ill in their ranks. I had to find out the hard way. I did poorly in my unit for the same reasons I had struggled at everything in my life up to that point. I was chaptered out after 2 years a month in jail and a suicide attempt.Coming out of the military I had never really held a real job in my life. I found that I struggled in a working environment consistently. I could not and still cannot keep a job for more than a year. I become cynical nihilistic and agitated I suppose it is because I lack meaning and purpose. In October of 2014 five strangers broken into my home and nearly beat me to death over a roommates drug debt. I had no dog in that fight. I had nine teeth irreparably knocked out of my skull and my skull fractured in such a way that the bones that hold my teeth in had to be surgically extracted.Having crooked eyes and 9 missing teeth that I can never get back has left me more isolated and more distant from normal happy and healthy than ever before. Shortly after my mother and my brother died by their own hand. I began to believe the very universe in which I inhabit conspired to move matter and energy in such a way as to produce optimal suffering, manifesting hardship with little pause for stability.In the last few years I have taken to extreme isolation only working enough to pay my rent and buy food and buying the time to lie in bed between quitting jobs.I feel as if life has been cruel to me in a statistically unlikely series of events that have never given me time to heal.I feel as if Diogenes, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer were rightI feel as if life as implied by linear extrapolation will simply get worse.I am not sure that given the arbitrary choice I would not ask for another day.I am so tired and it is been too long, and too difficult to justify the pervasive lie of a better tomorrow.a My lifelong experience with mental illness.",0

I got the opportunity to move out but now she wants me to come back to her. I love her so much but I want to stay strong for her by having distance between us. I want to be successful and have the freedom that I have always wanted. Its not fair that my older sister has the opportunity and she is just a year older.

I have planned to kill myself by train at the railroad tracks in a very quiet location easily accesible but however somebody else is also trying to kill themselves there as well and the local police in my area have a made a post about this looking for hom will this draw heat to the location and make it harder for me to die successfully due to police more likely to surveil the area?

"I feel that for someone of my age (M27) as if everyone is at a part I am not invited to.I have never, in all my life felt this sheer level of sexual frustration and its causing me to be incredibly down.

"I told her that i do not think she cares about me and only about the money i give her and she said that this is not true. Why do therapists have to lie right into the clients eyes? Its not true? Do you know what her argument was?It was that if the client does not invest money in therapy, he cannot get better. I think this is bullshit. I wish i could go to therapy and not pay. I always struggled with trust and attachment issues and I am still in a vulnerable spot and she knows this and i think she is not doing a single thing about it because she wants that money coming in. I think I am being used.I do have severe anxiety and I am paranoid too and i smoked these last couple of days so i think it could be my paranoia getting worse or something. I do not know. I guess I am a mess and I am being used.Fuck, this is just making me more and more suicidal. I do not think my therapist cares about me",0
"okay so basically after prolonged episode of panick attacks I notice like a wall sensation in my brain. I can still express emotions, but its very hard to feel it. Almost like if there is a wall in front of your emotions. let us say I am thinking about a memorie, I would usually get a nice satisfaction feeling but now I just do not feel it. Also its hard to feel hunger, sleepy, energy. I hate it so much. I can also feel an empty feeling in my brain that is super hard to describe. Does anyone know wtf I am having or have you experienced this?? AM I FEELING EMOTIONAL NUMBNESS???",0
"I grew up in suburban Tennessee, in a borderline fundamentalist Christian community. My childhood was extremely comfortable, happy, and sheltered. I love my parents, they are genuinely caring, funny, enjoyable people. I never really acted out and I always did well in school. Never once did I fear for my future or worry about what was going to happen to me in adulthood. When I was a senior in high school, I started to act out. I had a disrespectful, rude boyfriend. Looking back, I fully understand why my parents did not like him, but he was my first boyfriend and teenage me was blinded by how much I loved him. While we were dating, a tried weed and we had s\*x, but like most normal teenagers I kept this from my parents. One day, my dad happened upon a fairly explicit text from him, and I was told to immediately stop dating him. I refused. This continued repeatedly throughout my senior year, with threats to not send me off to college and constant yelling/crying matched between them and I about why god disapproves of me and why it was hurting them so much that I was s\*xually active. I eventually lied to them and told them I broke up with my boyfriend. The summer between senior year and college, I saw him secretly all the time. I was constantly lying. It felt horrible, but I was so dumb and in love I did it anyway. I regret this time in my life a lot. I went off to college somewhere far away (majored in music) and even then my dad was reading my texts. He read one about me going to smoke weed with some friends, and immediately cut me off. I started to strongly believe I needed to be independent. I never asked for help from my parents. I got a job and worked almost everyday between classes my entire freshman year. I paid for everything but my tuition. Although I was proud of myself for this at the time, It started a pattern that i could not reverse. It felt like I could not tell my parents anything for fear of losing them and losing the only real support system I had. I would not give them intimate details about my life anymore. I would not tell them when I was sad. I would not tell them when I would go to the doctor. I would not tell them when I got a diagnosis. I would not tell them if I was going to therapy. I only ever told them the positives. I would tell them if I would achieved something, or just had a normal, happy day. This worked for me for a long time. During college, I worked enough that I never had to ask for anything. I had my moments of sadness or worry, but I was happy knowing my life was stable. I broke up with my deadbeat boyfriend eventually, which was for the best, and suddenly my parents were proud of me again. The summer between my sophomore and junior years (age 20), I stayed with my parents and interned at a music company. I had a rough summer because I started randomly hooking up with guys (which was not my thing) and I had to get my appendix removed which brought on several complications. My parents knew I was up to something all the time and started treating me coldly again. The withdrew their normal, funny, friendly selves and barely interacted with me. By this time I was tired of arguing with them, so I just did not confront them about it. But even so, they enforced an 11 o clock curfew on me, and still occasionally bemoaned that I was not a Christian. This perpetuated the belief I already held, which was that my parents' hospitality towards me was conditional. It relied on me conforming to their idea of me. When I went back to school in the fall, the distance made things better. I started dating my current boyfriend, who I obviously could sleep with and hang out with and do anything with without my parents knowing, so they were in the dark, and perfectly happy about our relationship. My junior was incredibly happy. I had a boyfriend I loved, and my parents treated me like they were proud of me. Senior year came along and I began to consider my life after graduation. My boyfriend and I planned to move in together with a few of our friends as well. We were going to move to LA. This idea settled in the back of my mind during school, and then became the focus when I graduated. I came back to my parents' house this summer (I am 22 and I graduated in May) and the plan is to leave for Los Angeles at the end of July. I have been applying for jobs constantly. Incessantly. I wanted so badly to get a job before I told my parents I was moving in with my boyfriend. I have worked day in and day out and I have not received a single email back. I understand this is how the music industry is, but my fear of moving out there and having no help from my parents at all because they do not believe in living with someone before you are married is enormous. My dad once told me that if I moved in with a boyfriend I better be able to completely support myself because I could not expect any help from him. I am exhausted by the amount of work I have done at this point, and completely emotionally drained by the fact that I have no acceptances or denials, just radio silence. I have become so obsessive and stressed about it that my entire brain is consumed. I cannot be distracted. I cannot even sleep well. I am a gigantic disappointment to myself, even though I know the industry I am trying to get into has very high barriers to entry. I have never in my life had no job, no school, and no purpose. My parents still treat me differently because I am not a Christian. I do not go to church with them (because of a particular incident where I ran out crying because the sermon was about homosexuality and sex before marriage). My mom barely talks to me on these days. I have stopped exercising and eating healthily completely. I am on my phone an ungodly amount. I cry everyday and spend the other parts either applying to jobs or laying in bed looking at meaningless crap on instagram. I have an extremely low tolerance for stress now. I can become debilitatingly anxious at the drop of a pin. I do not think I am the same person to my friends or my boyfriend. I am not as funny or lighthearted, I am really easily socially exhausted. I just want to be better. I want to be kind to people and be a great friend and a great girlfriend. I really desperately want a close relationship with my family, but I am so scared of losing them if I am too honest. I cannot tell how much of my depression is situational and how much of it is something more chronic... and I cannot tell which option I should attempt to remedy first. Thanks for listening if you are reading this, and I am sorry it was so long. Help me",0
"Currently, I do not have anyone in my life I feel comfortable venting to. I know my family and close friends have love for me, but something inside me will not let me pass the line to express my feelings. My girlfriend was the closet thing I had to being honest about my feelings, but we recently broke things off (The breakup was respectful and necessary). I want to talk to a therapist without any of my friends or family knowing. For the longest time I have dealt with this battle against my pride and ego and I am tired of it. The thought of seeking help makes me anxious. How can I go about finding a therapist? I want to talk to a therapist",1
"Recently diagnosed myself with NPD, (narcissistic personality disorder) because it makes sense after a lot of research and reading on here. I am 22, and I feel like I have just woken up to the shit show that is who I am and i hate myself. I cannot think straight and I feel like I cannot go forward. I do not want to be here. I do not want to live a life of inevitable suffering and I really do not want to hurt anyone else, because I have and now I am so aware of myself and I cannot escape the prison of my own self. I want to die , but it would hurt my family so badly and I do not think I am brave enough to do it, perhaps in the most painless way I could. I think that knowing I could kill myself gives me some kind of comfort, just feel pure emptiness. Not sure anymore.",1
"I despise everything about being alive, despite that the concept of death shakes me to my fucking core. I have had suicidal thoughts as long as I can remember, but death still freaks me the fuck out, which is the only think that keeps me from ending it all. I do not want to keep on living, but the fact that death is so permanent and and an unknown feeling freaks me out so much more. So I guessing I am bound to keep on existing until its finally my time. I just hope it happens suddenly so I do not even know what is happening. God I wish death was not as scary as it actually was",1
I am thinking of quiting my new psychologist because the methods she is trying to teach to overcome my depression is basically the same as my old psychologist ( the same old plan a timetable and follow through it). The thing is my motivation to do literally anything is 0 but I am atleast able to carry out my daily chores but goddamn does it take a toll on you with the suicidal thoughts constantly jabbing you. My psychiatrist on the other hand said I could take ketamine which is subjective since I have had depression for 7 years. What do you guys think? Am I doing the right thing?,1
"New to posting here. On mobile so sorry for mistakes.I have (21F) been struggling with depression for about 5-6 years now but I have not gotten an official diagnosis yet. I do not think my parents want to admit I have it but I know I do.I did not used to feel this way. I was a happy teen for the majority of it. Things only really started to decline when I was 16. I have had ups and downs but its remained pretty consistent. However its been getting worse and worse since 2019. Even before all this covid crap.I have a nice life. I have a loving family and two wonderful parents that I love very much and who love me very much. I have some pretty great siblings too. I have a wonderful and amazing boyfriend that I met online last year and who is going to come visit me in September (unfortunately its a long distance relationship). I have a great best friend who I also met online and that I love very much. I have a good job (it does not pay enough at all and its incredibly boring but the family I work for is wonderful and is the only reason I have stayed with it for 3 years). I should be happy. I have so many wonderful blessings. But I am not.I have only felt worse and worse with each passing month. The depressive episodes are only getting longer and harder to crawl out of. I never want to do anything I like to do anymore. I cannot get excited about things that usually make me happy anymore. I keep having awful nightmares about feeling trapped, cornered, and helpless but everyone around me says Ill be just fine.I know I am loved. I know I am worthy of love. But I just feel so tired and lonely and empty. I am so sick of life.Sorry for the rant. I just feel really bad tonight and I had to vent because no one else is online or around to talk to. Tired",0
"I was dx w depression in 2007 and have been taking medications for the past several years that seem to be working okay. Not great, not terrible. Could possibly use some reeval. I lost my job in 3/2020 and was unemployed for 6 months, then lost that new job, and therefore my health insurance, in 4/2021 due to chronic health issues. I am currently working a seasonal temp job and cannot receive health insurance through it. I am not making enough money to afford private health insurance. I have been struggling with the most recent episode of MDE for a few months, and it has slowly been worsening as I am not not able to get my meds for either physical or mental diseases. I am completely out of energy and willpower to do anything: take a shower, make food, take a walk, color my coloring books. The longer this goes on, the less I am able to help myself to fight it. I am literally living to wake up to sit around and go back to sleep again. Need Help with No Insurance",0
I do not feel like I was ever meant to live. that is why none of this ever made me feelthe past was a lie. If it was truth it would have stayed but nothing does. Me being here is a lie which is why all I can do is distract myself.Why no amount of pain has ever driven me to change bc I knew all of this was ultimately worthlessliving is just playing pretend and all I can do is distract myself There is no better,0
"I do not show it when I am out, but today I came home and my shoes were dirty. I got ridiculously angry and starting tearing up. I was actually having a good day, was not sad, but I keep like I have this tension I have to release. Its like I have energy. I guess Ill mention I was fasting, but I just ate and I am not angry anymore but I still feel this sort of tension I have to release. This is one of the main reasons why I binge eat, I get this adrenaline I need to release and my day just seems way too boring. I do not understand, sometimes I so irritable for no reason? Like even if I am having a good day. Fasting is supposed to make you feel good, I was having a good day, felt pretty, but then I get into these angry/sad moods where I just want to scream at everyone? I am able to hide it at work but I get so angry over stupid things and I just do not get it. I still sorta feel it, I do not know if its like, sadness, arousal. I just have this tension I need to let out!Could it be bipolar? Adhd? I have heard of BPD but I feel like that is the same at bipolar. Idk I do not think I just have depression because I have lots of happy moments but then fall into sadness. A lot of it comes from my eating disorder. Opinions? Super angry and little things?",0
"I just do not know what I feel anymore. I feel like a ghost, just going through all the motions in life. it is weird, I know. This is not what I normally go through during a episode. I just feel very stupid, ""out of it."" Like..an earth worm. Just doing the things to keep being alive. Eating, sleeping. I am being very careless and stupid. Driving idiotically, just being aloof and out of body. Tried to hook up with a complete loser and piece of shit. Even my friend was disappointed, saying she thought I was smarter than that. I am smarter. But recently, not so muchI just try so much to care or motivate myself for the things we all look forward in life. Money, getting a job, being with friends, love and sex. I just do not know where I belong. I get upset at everything. I am filthy. As odd as this sounds, I feel like a failure. I have not felt like that for years.Still no luck with finding a job before college. At this point I hate the idea of it even. I have not enjoyed sex or dating at ALL. Every little thing just pisses me off or makes me inpatient. I will try meeting with people whom I think I will like and just completely get them out of my life before I let them in. I know it is so fucked up but I just want to feel at peace with myself. Enjoy company. Enjoy sex and the luxuries of getting that sweet, sweet paycheck. it is sad, before anyone points it out. I do not even want to die. I just feel like I prefer being a nice place away from everything. Before someone points it out, yes it is unhealthy. Staying in bed all day is unhealthy I am in a phase of life where I just want to be a quiet little place, and it is hurting everyone around me",1
"I finally was prescribed the pills to get the job done. Childhood rape, bullying, a toxic family, my career and car and home taken by Covid. It can all finally be over with.I finally have what I need, and I cannot swallow the pills. People rely on me and I am not allowed to struggle. If there is a problem, I am asked to fix it. Fuck me if I impose on someone in my life with my fucking feelings.If I sign off, the only thing that will ever be said about me is that he died a loser and a coward. He skipped out on the people that relied on him.Fuck it. I would not care if I was gone. But I cannot swallow the pills. I finally have the tools.",1
"So in all of the years I have been struggling with this illness, I have never been substantially more depressed in the mornings when I wake up than I have been throughout the remainder of the day. Over the past week or two, I have woken up just feeling absolutely horrible, but it fizzles out and is not as intense by the end of the day. I cannot put a reason to it. Its so confusing Morning depression?",0
"Hey guys, its me again. I had total insomnia 2 1/2 years ago caused by cbd oil and Flonase nasal spray interaction. Now I have total insomnia caused by doxy. Had it for 1 1/2 months. I get acupuncture 3 times a week which helps me from having to go up on my meds. I take 200 mg of Seroquel. Some nights are rough. I feel I am up all night and sweat profusely. Other times my rest is better and I can get lots of dream state rest. Still I think of suicide. On the other hand I am holding on. I feel like Ill be like this forever but every one says Ill get better that it just takes time. I feel my gaba receptors are damaged and will just take time to heal. I do sleep its just my mind does not recognize it as sleep. I am afraid Ill be like this forever but on the other hand part of me hopes that my body can heal and I can start feeling like I am sleeping again. My mind says Ill never heal even though I healed from total insomnia last time. I am just so scared and I stress out my family even though I do not want to. I lost my independence again and I wonder if Ill ever heal again. Total insomnia from Doxycycline makes me think of suicide daily",1
in my closet using my hangar thing I tryed killing myself with my shirt. I coudnt do it. I stopped myself. I want to die. Fuck instincts I cannot kill myself,1
"I have wanted to kill myself for so long. Probably over 10 years. I thought that if I improved my life I would get better. I got married, became an attorney, and got a pretty good job. None of that really helped. I had done therapy several times before, but never medication. So about 6 months ago I went and got on Prozac. At first it seemed to help, but then it tapered off so I doubled the dose. Now even that seems to not be enough. Even with my attorney job, medical care in the you.S. is still insanely expensive. What I am on right now definitely is not working, and I want to try something else or get my Testosterone tested or get tested for ADHD or something, I do not know, but I have run out of money. I cannot even afford to renew my car registration. How do people afford this shit? Like I work my ass off and have a good education and I cannot even afford basic mental health care. I want to keep trying to make it, I really do, but I just do not see how this ever works. Tried to get help, ran out of money. I do not know what to do.",0
"Whenever I voice out my suicidal thoughts to a friend she always says ""just think about what your mom would feel"". She does not explicitly say that killing yourself is a selfish act, but that is the point I am getting from her. Makes me wonder, if a person really wants to die, is not it selfish for them for asking the person to ""stay"" even though they know the person is has it so bad? If someone wants to go, cannot they just let them go?? Is it selfish for wanting to die?",0
"For four weeks I have had thoughts and dreams about how nobody understands what I am battling in my mind, everybody is angry and shouting at me for being so silent and useless and a burden. In these dreams I go to the bathroom, empty a bottle of pills on my hand and throw all of them down my throat. My knees get weak, I break down and then sleep. Even though I am unconscious, I see how somebody discovers me and what I did and just stands there indifferentlylike she expected it but is not surprised so she does not care.I call a therapist because these thoughts get persistent in my day. I try to not overhope since therapy is no magic, I am aware of that. An hour later, he tells me he will not work with me and I should just take pills. No therapy is needed here since I am already unfixable. I leave him crushed, baffled and angry.I visit a friend the first time since the pandemic for three days. We planned this for three months now. The first two days go absolutely pleasantly. We talk and laugh, play cards (Exploding kittens and Durak) and drink a little, we watch movies (Disney's Luca and Netflix's Ratched). Third day, he changes. When I talk to him, he always just monotously answers ""Okay."" I try to tell him, I am just trying to smalltalk and that his indifference feels cold to me, and he responds that he does not have to be interested in everything I say. That hurt. I go quiet. I do not know what to do or say to him. As a kid I was bullied for being an odd one out in school and by my family. that is why I tend to go silent so to not annoy anyone and become invisible. Then he gets angry at me for ignoring him. I get quieter and secretly cry in the bathroom. The visit ends. My mind is confused and broken.One week later I think ""whatever."", start to ignore my feelings and my hurts by taking SSRI again. I still have a good batch of unused ones from when my maternal grandfather died and I developed a (now partially overcome) hypochondriasis which was fed by me actually having a for six months unrecognised infection of my CNS. So since nobody wants to help me to learn how to deal with these emotions and my suicidal thoughts, I might aswell just take these fake blisses of happiness. It is the only option I have. Fake smile, no cry, here we go.Third pill in I get headaches throughout the day. My sleep is disrupted, I wake up several times in the night. Even though in the morning I wake up rested I am awfully tired at day. I have to lay down for half an hour in the afternoon or I would crash hard. I am not even sleeping, just laying there with my eyes closed. Throughout the day it sometimes feels like I am not even there. While reading I see my arms and it feels like they are some weird noodles that do not belong to my body. it is as someone is standing behind me holding the book. My head feels as if it is floating in a gelatine of air. Sometimes it even is hard to read the words in the book. But why should I be concerned? it is better this way. I am tranquilized.Fifth pill in, today. I realize how many friends I tried to talk to about my struggles and how every single one of them told me in the end that they cannot handle that part of me or straight up do not care. I am not even sure if there is any friend who would realize that I am gone if I would be offing myself right now. I think that they would realize that I am not responding to any chat messages after a while. But after that why would they care to investigate any further. It would seem like I left (or ignoring them) and they would forget about me.that is where I am right now. In my head I am walking through a ghost town. A town that never lived. A town that is made of gray and is shone upon by a misty moon. A town that has empty houses for those friends that will never come. A town that is filled with the graves of all the people who I pushed away, who distanced themselves, who I lost. Here I am, a lifeless wind howling through my empty mind. I cannot scream because nobody would hear it. I cannot cry because of my fake happiness. The flame in my heart has burnt cold. I am nothing more than a hollow body, no life, no spark. I do not know where I am.",1

it is a lot more easier for people to cry at someone is funeral than it is to ask them how it is going every once in a while. Imagine if they would answer with anything but a standard 'I am fine'. No one wants to hear about your loneliness or existential dread. I just realised something,1
"you are lonely. I get it. I am too. You might have friends, family, a bf or a gf, people that you love.. but you still feel lonely. Like no one can even understand a tiny bit about you, about what you feel and how you live. it is like you are stuck in your mind, in a thick fog that nobody can enter and that you will not even try to leave. You might have hope. You might not.But tell yourself that : we are thousands and thousands feeling just like you. We all have our little foggy mind of our own and we are all stuck in there and nothing each of us feels is the same as someone else. Pain cannot be compared. We all feel it differently.So even when you are alone. Even when there is no hope. Think about all the other. Who are keeping this fog at bay as hard as they can. Think about us who are struggling to survive. Thousands of us are gone.. but even more even still fight it. So do not let go. We might not be together, but we are all linked somehow.you are not alone. you are not alone. Even if you are alone.",0
"Please for the love of god someone interact with this. I know it is not healthy but I really need it. I have been living and working these past few years in the Hopes that eventually things will be solved. What things you ask? Well I will list them off here really quickly.1. Hate my body, everything about it from my face to my stomach to my dick. Everything is the exact opposite of everything I want it to be and it IS impossible to change.2. I am going to die someday and all I have ever done will be rendered meaningless.3. I do not love things like everyone else does. I do not love real people and the people I do love I cannot be with because they are not real.For years and years I have been living life off of the belief that these problems will have a solution. I have done the liberty of listing the solutions as well.1. Maybe far off in the future I will be able to switch bodies through brain transplant to something I want. Maybe I will be able to construct a robotic body of my own.2. Maybe someday they will make a way to become immortal, or find a way to resurrect the long dead. And I will be able to continue enjoying the life I have loved so much.3. Maybe even further off in the future they will invent a way to travel through dimensions, and I will be able to be with someone I really love.I have believed these things, really I had hope. But I have had it thrown in my face. I have been told everything I have hoped for, everything I ever wanted is impossible. I do not want my life to end, I love it so much.

"So I know I did not have a healthy upbringing, and I know my mental state and the way I handle things in my life are not ideal or even healthy. But it worked.I was productive, I achieved some goals, and I feel I have made genuine progress in my life. However, this was all accomplished using anger as the primary driving force. Wanted something I did not have? Get angry and I would do somethingDidnt like the situation I was in? Get angry to figure it outHated not being productive for days on end? Get angry enough to get up and get goingNow I have a problem; the anger is not there anymore in the way it used to be. Its no longer the hot, roaring anger I could point at a goal and accomplish it. Its turned into a cold emotion, something that I cannot utilize. I do not even know if how I am describing it is making sense, but what I do know is now I find it literally impossible to achieve anything. I feel like the steam that was used to power the engine is no longer there. And now I am just confused as to what I should do, because its been almost two years of just ice cold rage that does nothing but exacerbate my issues.Does anybody have any experience with something like this?I need to get a therapist but I am waiting for in person to become more accessible in my area because virtual is too impersonal for me to be able to get anything out of it.

"Hello to whomever might be reading.The last nine months have been hell for me. I have been through legal issues caused by someone else, that made it impossible for me to work while that was being sorted out, and I am only now able to start working again - but I have lost my whole savings trying to support myself for months. I have also been only able to afford a meal a day since around April, so I am all sorts of weak right now. In that time, I have also been heavily triggered by PTSD caused by abuse in my childhood as the abusive parent was the one that caused those legal issues that affected me. I would also been unable to do any activities since Covid-19 that were fundamental to my mental wellbeing. Now that work is starting, I am working six day weeks and waiting for my first paycheck in August so I can start eating regularly again. Being depressed, I found it hard to find enjoyment in anything, and still do. And yes, my mind has and continues to go to dark places, and I am actively trying to counter them with tools I have gotten in therapy over the years, and some days are more successful than others.So for the past year, the only constant thing I would enjoyed was a video game. In time, I even stopped enjoying the gameplay itself but fell in love with its characters, one in particular who reminded me a lot of myself. He was just so adorable and sweet, even if the graphics were a little behind the times. So when I had nothing else going on, I could just play the game and take comfort in his presence. It was one of the only few things I had for comfort.The company making the video game just recently announced that they were remodeling the characters and my character looks very different. He feels and looks like a completely new person. And while it might seem very trivial... it was pretty much the last straw that broke me down. I have contacted the company a few times, no response, and they do not address it on social media. And I avoid social media because people are quick to insult you for feeling so strongly about a video game character. I am just finding it hard to play this game anymore, which leaves me with... nothing. No other video game, no other activity, no other comfort character. it is like when your favorite character dies in a movie or book, except then you can still go back and enjoy them. With this, he is just... gone. It feels like I have lost a close friend.I feel empty. I would rather not be told how trivial all this might seem, because intellectually, I know. I just would very much like to be understood and empathized with right now so I can try to muster the strength to move on. My last straw was a change in the video game I play",0
"I can go walking, but it is not going to last very long. I could read a book outside, but I do not really read that much. I could just get some food and eat outside, but I feel awkward about people judging me. When I do spend that time outside, and I do not have much to do, I end up watching others, which not only makes me feel like a bit of a creep, but also makes me sad to see everyone else enjoying themselves.I wish I could enjoy other things outside since I know I feel better out there, but not having anything to do while outside sometimes feels worse. Spending time outside tends to make me feel better, but I have nothing to do outside.",0

I had big dreams and goals, I was a happy kid, genuinely nice but the world has changed me. For the first time I need toe be honest with myself. I want to die. And I do not see anything happy in my future. After all the hope and let downs I have had I would be a fool to keep going and allowing the world to continue to beat me. If someone seees this I just want you to know I tried. I truly did put up a fight. But sadly as always I did not come out victorious. My family does not deserve this.

"I have dealt with depression all of my life. So I am used to it, but a few years ago I started to recover and things were awesome then the pandemic happened. Now my life is ok, but everyone and everything around me is falling apart. I thought I was okay, but as the months go on I am realizing I am not okay.I am scared for the future of myself and my family in a way I never have been. I lost my friend group during the pandemic and I am not even really keen on trying to talk to anyone. it is like I am waiting for the shoe to drop, but I am not sure what that even is? Like I am on edge for no reason. I do not feel motivated to do anything. I woke up a few days ago and watched aquarium videos for the entire day. That was it. Not sure I even moved much. I do not even attempt to play games, use my computer, or any of my projects. I find myself tearing up for little reasons. I know it all points to depression, but it feels like no other kind of depression I have ever had. I do not really know why? There was not a single event or anything. I am on cymbalta, but I have been on a stable dose for years. So it is not med changes or medication. The weirdest depression",0

"This really fits better here, I am thinking about ways I could go out. Nobody would miss me after a few days anyway Honestly, this life has been nothing but the worst experience possible and always goes downhill no matter what I try I have had to deal with being isolated as a child, Growing up with neither parents and not even knowing one, being Bullied throughout the entire course of school. Better yet, how about changing schools and being isolated harder because nobody knows you. It also does not help being ugly and the biggest person in every room.I had nobody to support or encourage me during schooling so I just did whatever and somehow passed. You would think hs would have been better but nope, I literally fit in with no groups and stayed to myself until I dropped out in 10th grade.But here we are now, I am an at home slave for lazy people who will use many types of verbal and mental abuse to make me do things which has made it impossible for me to tell people No. if I am injured or sick I am forced to work through it but if someone else is the same, I have to be a nurse while also being insulted for not doing things perfect. I am not allowed to make any accidents I am 20, have been trying to finish high school for the past 3 years and I am at 23.5/24 credits and have to wait until October to get my final half of a class.Its been setback after setback, I have gained extreme body image issues to the point I workout in a very unhealthy way, pushing myself and also staving myself.

Still figuring out life, sorry to say it does not get easier. The last two years of my life have been a mess. My wife and I split and reconciled right before covid. For that I am glad. Over that time I took up painting as an outlet for my depression and something to do. it is helping. I am getting better and painting has opened some doors for me. Not enough to quit my day job unfortunately. But enough to make me want to keep on painting. My family acts supportive, but not in a satisfying way. So I guess I am looking for some sort of validation. Can anyone relate? Family",0
"If I believed in some type of a joyful eternal afterlife, I might be able to guess that any resilience evidenced within this earthly lifetime would ultimately be rewarded to a way more intense degree than any I could imagine inside my simple, small intellect. I just impulsively checked for some relevant data online and found out that there might be something like over 2 billion Christians on earth.But as it remains, I believe that possibly nothing special happens to us after we die. Following death, there is just immediate darkness, silence, numbness -- nothing. The experience of death is akin to the experience of deep dreamless sleep.I can vividly remember how incredibly purposeful my life felt during childhood, when I was thoroughly religious and believed that everything I was doing was being gleefully monitored by a loving God (or maybe multiple gods) who wanted the best for me and other humans. But as the years passed and I encountered more and more unanswered / blatantly ignored prayers, I grew to express some minimal amount of basic skepticism toward the idea that any deity loves us or actively participates in our lives.While I will not get specific about my problems within this post, I will just mention in passing that I have almost certainly suffered much more than at least 80% of my generation's peers. And as my suffering has gotten worse across time, I have come to reach a point at which I have found no higher purpose to my suffering -- there is no probable reward one faces for continuing to deal with severe, crippling, life-ruining depression.Laughable as this may seem, I used to believe that continued suffering would result in the cultivation of continued wisdom, almost as if the reward for ongoing pain was to become a goldmine of hard-won insights which could (one day) easily wrest a fresh interlocutor out of fairly deep suffering via pithily expressed wisdom. But now all I deal with each day is a sort of ... numb resignation before a potentially premature end to life.What am I supposed to do if I can realistically expect sporadically increasing suffering in my near and continued future? In the absence of religious belief, there seems to be no way to derive any sense of meaning or fulfillment from a life of serious and potentially mind-destroying suffering.Life feels like it is losing its meaning with each passing day. Does my suffering have no higher purpose?",1

"Something told me to make this post. I do not want sympathy, or I am sorry, or any of that. I am past that. I have made lots of posts in the past to get that kind of response. That kind of connection to another human, recognize my pain. This post is not about that, it may seem like it is, I suppose, but it is not. I guess, I just want to tell the story of why I have depression and anxiety and so many other mental illnesses. it is going to be a long post, and for that, I do not expect many people to read it.I have contemplated suicide, but never attempted it. By contemplate, I mean I held a gun in my hand, looked it up and down, loaded it, put it in my mouth, put it against my head, and thought very deeply about pulling the trigger. I have contemplated suicide for at least 10 years now. It has put me in a state where I am both godless and god-fearing. The best place to start, I think, is the first trauma I remember and go from there. When I was about 5-6 I had a crush on a boy in my class. If it matters, I am a bisexual male, more on that later. Well, I was quite innocent of the idea of love and what one should like and not like, so I told my mom about the crush. Her response was to scratch me across the face and call me a faggot. I still have the scars to this day. Four scars on the left side of my face. I made a post the other day showing my face, but you cannot really see them, I do not like to draw attention to them, and thankfully no one has ever asked about them.That is the tip of the iceberg. When my parents were still together, she would lock us out of the house. Hot summer days in the Ohio River valley. We would be out there for hours, upwards of 6 hours without water or food. And really I guess this is the lesser of it, not so bad, we were kids, play outside she would tell us. So we did, we just could not go back in until she called us. Anyways, I really looked forward to school days. This went on for a few years, I was between the ages of 5 and 10.School itself was not so bad. I did not learn to read until I was in the 3rd grade, and I was always taken out of class because I had special classes I had to go to, including one for a speech impediment, I could not say my Rs, the speech impediment went on till I was almost in High School.Well, when my parents got divorced was when the fun really began, I say fun because I try to think on the lighter side of it, could have been worse. I remember every aspect of the father's first apartment. We lived near a small airport, the house was two stories, we lived on the first floor. Entering the house, on the right was a staircase that led upstairs to the landlord's apartment. Directly in front of the front door was the door that led into the basement, where the washer and dryer were, concrete floors, largely empty space, was not much in there. The third door was my father's apartment, to the left. A white door, it led into the living room. There was a fireplace, a smallish TV, the couch my sister slept on, my dad's drawing table, and a couple of bookcases. In fact, I am going to stop here and suffice to say that I could describe to you every detail of that apartment. All except my room. I can not tell you anything about my room. I do not know what color the door was, I do not know what side of the wall the beds were on, I know nothing about that room. What I do know, or at least strongly suspect, is that I was raped in that room over a period of 2 years. Aforementioned memory lapse aside, I am told by my brother that I say ""No, do not do it, stop"" in my sleep quite often. My sister, deceased sister, had similar gaps of memory and told me one day that she suspected it was happening. And thirdly, NSFW warning, my anus has a tear in it. I was about 12-14, as memory serves that I lived in that apartment on the weekends. A mighty bold claim, I do not remember the actual events, but I believe there is evidence to lead to that conclusion. I want to think that I am wrong, but part of me tells me it is true.There are more minor things in my childhood that come to mind, but I think they really do pale compared to what I have already said. To this day, my family is, well, unloving. They will tell me they love me, but they do not show it. In fact, the only time they really listen, or half-listen, is when I threaten suicide. This could be why I contemplate it so much, just to be heard. Neither of my parents could give a shit about what inspires me, what passions I have, what love I feel. Two examples, I wanted to be a paleontologist until I was 16, loved dinosaurs, I kept this, like many other things, to myself., until one day I told my dad. He said I would never be a paleontologist, I should give up on that idea, and that I should instead be an engineer like he was. The second example, I love playing the piano, I know virtually nothing about it, I am self-taught, and frankly, I feel I can play a pretty damn good improv. My mother, frequently, tells me I am terrible at it and that I need lessons. Which may very well be true, I may be terrible and everyone else who has heard me play is lying to me, I do certainly need lessons because I cannot read music, although I do not have much interest in playing what someone else wrote, it is an emotional release for me and I like it that way, so I am stubborn.Perhaps some of this post is just whining, I need to grow up, I need to move on. I should not be defined by my past or what others say. And most of the time I try to keep that mindset, what is in the past is in the past, but (I was once told by a very wise man to not use the word but, because it negates everything you said before, I feel it is needed here) the past can still hurt. And perhaps that is why I am making this post, not on a throwaway account, I thought about that. But like my scars, let the world see this, my past does define me in some way, it has certainly shaped me. I have come to the end of this post and I still don' know the purpose. It does not make it feel any better, and no one can go back and change any of this, and quite frankly I am not even depressed about it right now. I was earlier today when my brother threatened to kick me out because I have not done the dishes in a few days, but not at the moment of writing. Maybe, and I think this is true, maybe I just need someone to know these things. Not because it has any real impact on their life, I certainly do not think anyone is going to read this and say, MY GOD, MY LIFE IS CHANGED. No, I think I just wanted someone to know my pain, my past. I suppose I am sorry you read that. Me",0

"I have had everything I ever asked for twice and still I was unhappy and ungrateful. I am not the suicidal depressed more the laugh at myself and life sucks let us get on with it kind of depressed. I have a daughter with an incredible woman who I kind of broke many years ago, I left her when she needed me most. It tore her apart and 5 years later I am back with her but she only looks like that woman. She is not the same person and I am a twat for thinking she would be. The other time I got what I asked for was another woman, she was hands down the best person I had ever met. She could see I was just an emotionless void but my god she loved me, she wanted to spend her life with me, get a house, marriage etc. She was beautiful too but I just could not appreciate her for who she was. She begged and begged for me to stay as she loved me more than anything else. Threw her away and got back with the mother of my daughter. I warned the second woman many many times I am not a good person many times but she would not accept it and even after all this I do not think she is changed her opinion. Depression is horrible, not for what it can do to you but what it can do to others. Either life would have made me happy yet both times I have chucked it away. I know to many my complaints are trivial. Some of you guys have it so so much worse but guess that void just hits no matter how good your life can be.

When I get home tomorrow, I will have nothing. Sure, the house will be there. A little bit of the furniture. But nothing meaningful. she will be gone. The dog will be gone.

"Hi,I am a 28 year old (she will of a) man from the UK suffering with **severe** depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment, now I am what I call, stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had, everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught, distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved, distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day, I have been stuck alive, too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything, believe anything, want anything, feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it, my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me, he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair, I know this is happening I just cannot stop it, meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a full-time alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself, I am open-minded, but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore, pre-pandemic I was doing my dream job, still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available, being mistreated at each company of course, I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our pre-existing issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child, people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate, like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help, albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all, I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness, I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted, I do not need money I just want fulfillment, I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate, I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? Am I Dead?",0
Hopefully I do not break down again but still do not want to be here alone anyone here want to talk about what is hurting us Hard night slightly better day,1
"Turned 24(m)today and not a single happy birthday.Truth be told do not really care for it celebrating the day I was born. Rather celebrate the death. I remember my tattoo I got when I was 16. The meaning behind it for me was to symbolising suicide or ppl who taken their own life. Never really understood why I wanted it back then I was a happy kid, But as I got older I realised. Id already marked myself. Been down the counselling route few times but its all the same.Only thing stopping me from taking pills (that I have got quite a stock) is that fact possibility it will fail and I will have to deal with the consequences of still being here, with maybe damaged organs. what is the actual point ?",1
"I tried to jump off a building, just something happened that brought me to a breaking point. I got restrained and later told I had disrupted some event so I should not have done it. I guess even trying to end it all is something I do wrong. I tried to kill myself today.",1
"The title is exaggerating a little, but I feel like everything I see is a sign that I, and people like me should not exist.I am a short, bisexual autistic man with several mental illnesses who lives in the Irish countryside.I want to be stronger, but bigger people say I am just compensating for being small, for being born the way I was, and so I can never be bullied again.I want people to understand my struggles with autism, I get told I should not have children, and that my existence is inherently wrong.I stay away from politics because it stresses me out, and I try to help out in the real world, I get lumped in with fucking fascists.I get bullied and beaten down for everything that I like, for no reason.The way I act, the way I talk, the way I interact with people, it all gets mocked and I just do not say a word.it is almost like there is signs saying that I am fundamentally wrong as a human.I ignore it as best I can, but I just cannot handle it right now.

"(Starting my senior year of college) - posted in r/suicidewatch as well. September 2017: Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time. Turns out to be basically negligible and a case that goes away if I lose weight (learned this much later on).December 2017: After 6 scheduled (and cancelled) surgery dates with plastic surgeons to remove the gynecomastia, my parents recommend that I see our doctor and talk about depression. I oblige.January 2018: After my first visit with the doctor, I start taking Zoloft 25mg 1x/day.March 2018: I up the dosage to 50mg/day. Start complaining to doctor about ""emotional numbness"" and taper back down to 25mg 2x/day.April 2018: I am at a bar and get cold clocked (to this day I still do not know who hit me). Clean mandibular fracture and broken in two places. Wired shut for 4 weeks after that.August 2018: Decide I am good and that I do not need Zoloft anymore (was also very overweight). Go off the drug and two weeks later, I total my '01 BMW e46 M3 that I bought a year prior after running a stop light I did not see. T-boned a taxi.September 2018: Researching that Zoloft weakens bone density and increases risk of fractures by up to 75%. Thought of ""if you were not on Zoloft, your jaw would not have broken"" starts to grow in my head. call my mom on my birthday, mention suicide for the first time. She says I ""cannot leave this earth"" in tears.October 2018: Meet a new girl, we become boyfriend and girlfriend.April 2019: I buy a penis enlargement device ""just because"" to see if I can get any bigger for my gf at the time. And mind you, I was not insecure about my size to begin with, I just wanted to see if it could get bigger. I ended up suffering an injury from doing too much, too fast that left my penis in a ""hard flaccid"" state sometimes, and actually lost a bit of length and girth because of it. This leads to a lot of anxiety and depression that I still experience to this day.May 2019: Depressed, I decide to start Zoloft again. 25mg 1x/day.September 2019: I go off of Zoloft again. Girlfriend and I break up.October 2019 - January 2021: Working full-time, met another girl around Feb 2020 that I dated up until recently. Things we just OK. Covid did not make things any easier, but whatever.February 2021: I approach a urologist about the potential of Zoloft ruining my sex drive, and that is the reason I cannot perform like I used to. I start doing research and come across Wellbutrin. I start taking Wellbutrin 100mg SR 1x/day.March 2021: I go off of Wellbutrin.\*\*\*Wellbutrin 100mg/1x per day continues for month-long streaks coupled with about a month off. This cycle repeats itself for about 3 months up until the middle of this past June.\- - - - - - - - - - -End of June 2021: I come across a bunch of photos of myself a year or two prior to the gynecomastia/Zoloft phase. Look myself and love what I see. My face looked different. I remember my penis looking and functioning the way it used to. I remember the way my teeth pressed together when I closed my mouth, and how my jaw did not click everytime I opened it or when I gave my girlfriend oral.\*\*first scare here\*\* (July 2, 2021): I take my father's competition ruger out of the case next to his bed (I am at my parent's house here). I hold it. I look at it. I wonder... I do not cry or whatever. I try to fight. I try to think about what I can do differently, but nothing really happens. I put the gun back in its case, and I decide to light a bowl and get high. I pass out at the top of my parent's stairs until 2pm in the afternoon. I had off of work, and the rest of the family is at our vacation house, so I was home alone.July 3, 2021: I decide to do something, so I book a tee time and drop a 72 on 18-holes from the tips here at our home course, with a 33 (-3) on the back nine. Golf is a big passion of mine, and I have my own horror stories of trying to play in college/throughout highschool that I will not get into. I have played golf my entire life.\- - -July 4, 2021 (today):I wake up, depressed again. Not high this time, but I start reading about people on psychiatric medications and how it can permanently mess them up. I start thinking about everything, from how my dick is fucked up, to how my face looks different from a jaw fracture I suffered because I chose to take antidepressants (and how the SSRIs probably weakened my bone density), how I pissed away good relationships with good women. Everything.I go back upstairs and take my Dad's ruger out again. I look at it. This time I cry a little bit. I start to realize I am unstable and the only thing holding me back is that I really do not know how to operate a ruger, and the magazines are out (though there are bullets in the magazines). I frighten myself again, and put it back in the case. I cry to God a bit here and say ""I am really having a tough time here man. I do not know what to do.""10:24am July 4, 2021: I hit ""post"" here on Reddit, then grab my keys and head into town for my habitual coffee. Feeling a bit better after getting this off my chest. Been a tough weekend - home alone on July 4th - what is the point after you have thoroughly damaged your body/mind?",0
"(18m) my dad wanted me to go on a trip with him and his x girlfriend which I have an active restraining order against because she threatened to murder me to see my uncle who is in a coma dying of cancer. I said I absolutely care about my uncle, but I just cannot mentally deal with watching him die which I have seen with other family members, and sleep in the same house with someone who I have a restraining order against. He said that I am not a real man for my decision and that I am extremely selfish for letting the family down. He now wants nothing to do with me, and is going to take my car because its still under his name when he gave it to me at 16 which I do not know how to get to work now. This is the only time I have ever stood up for myself on a issue and now he hates me. My dad just disowned me",0
"Every day at some point, at least once, my brain reminds me of how weak I am and how much I fail. My girlfriend is out of town for the moment and I have been avoiding telling her how I am feeling because I do not want to take away from the fun she is having with her friend in Maine. there is so much I want to tell her, so much I need to tell her. I am falling apart and its my fault like it always is, and I do not know if I can step foot in our favorite ramen place ever again. I am sorry I continue to fail and I can never succeed in being normal.For context, me and my girlfriend of almost 19 months are very close and happy with one another, but one of her best friends constantly makes me feel uncomfortable due to events in the past and how she would be dry with me but not as dry with him in our group chat (that I have been gone from since that day) It was her birthday, and she asked if I could go along with said friend, who I am uncomfortable with. I told her its your birthday, of course you can and she asked her friend to come. And she was worried before, and she asked me if I would be uncomfortable, and I told her no. And I failed her. I was so uncomfortable, the whole day I was falling apart, and she trusted that Id be fine. She trusted me and I disappointed her. For most of the day, I wanted to push myself to talk to her but as she was mostly with said friend, I could not do it, and was trying to give myself as much space as I could. I know I am such a pussy. I was falling apart and I was breaking down. I just stuck with her dad while the two of them walked around. When we went to said ramen store with all four of us I left at some point to sit outside and try to calm myself down. And later on when the day was finished we talked about the day and we talked about how badly I hurt her and how badly I made her feel, that she could not even talk to me on her day. I am so fucking sick of myself, I try to be the best I can yet I somehow fail. Its been a week since that day and were both trying to forget about the pain it still haunts me so much even though she is forgiven me for it. Remnants of that day tear me up and knock me down, and I just want to get away from it. I want to hit myself. I am sorry for everything, I am sorry i did not do enough. My mistakes continue to torture me in my head at least once a day",0
"Dad rejects and refuses to try and understand or help me get through the negative emotions and suicidal thoughts I feel. He guilt trips me and makes me the bad guy all the time even if something is not my fault. Hes recently guilted me into keeping a full-time job and trying to go to college full-time. That means 50-60 hours of my week will be for work and school. I no longer have a social life (besides my gf), I no longer enjoy my hobbies, and just existing in general is actually physically exhausting. My mom died 5 years ago so I cannot talk with her about my issues and my stepmom does not seem to care much. I also got diagnosed with T1 Diabetes 2 years ago and having a chronic illness also makes life physically and mentally painful. So about 2 years ago my dad and I got in a 2 hour argument about how I was feeling mentally and he said You know what? let us just not talk anymore. At all. I know you love me and I love you too but that does not mean we have to like each other! Whenever we see each other well try to be friendly but other than that let us just avoid each other. he legit said that after I told him I feel like he does not try to help me mentally or try to understand how I feel and why I feel that way. He was ready to just kick me out of his life. That tells me he does not actually give a crap about me as much as he says he does. Just knowing that my only blood parent that I have left feels that way about me is just painful. I have had enough of this life. I have a plan to kill myself already, I just need to get the courage to go through with it. Thanks for reading. Life is too much",1
"Telling yourself to soldier it out because it gets better only works for so long, but what about when things never (seem to) get better? Day after day, year after year, my life is changing, but I still feel the same; sad, lonely, insecure, and inadequate. In high school, I told myself Id grow out of these feelings, its just teenage angst.In college, I told myself Id grow out of these feelings, I am in my golden years, developing myself, and actually moving forward.Now that I have finished college and going into the working world, what am I supposed to tell myself: Ill grow out of these feelings when I get that job I want? When I get married? When I retire? All I want is to feel comfortable in my skin, to feel like I have actual friends, to be able to handle pressure, bad times and rejection, to not hate who I see in the mirror, to not feel ugly, and to not feel inadequate all the time.

"I have struggled with mental health issues for as long as I can remember. Throughout my life, I have often wondered whether I should end it all for the sole reason that my existence makes other people more miserable, because they have to deal with me and my disordered self all the time.

I hate life,1
"I have been having suicidal thoughts ever since i was like in 5th grade or so because i felt like a burden on my family, friends and just generally anyone I have interacted with. I have had a really hard time with talking to people too, and everyone in my family judges me for it. They are not wrong in doing so but a lot of the times i physically cannot open my mouth and speak. I got a girlfriend around my freshman year in highschool and despite that the thoughts did not go away. I really was happy at times and imagined us living together after getting married and that, but a few years later we broke up. Even though she said she did not want to get married I think she is lying to me. She told me that she did not want to get into any relationships until a few years later, only to get into one about a week later. This and other incidents of her lying to me made me more sad than i ever had been. Compounding all those other reasons i felt that those years we were together were all a lie which sucks when she could have been the person to pull me out of wanting to kill myself. The suicidal thoughts have gotten to the point to where I am almost always thinking about gruesome ways in which i can kill myself or be killed by others. I have even slipped up and asked my ex to kill me in a begging kind of way. I told her ""Kill me"" over and over to her face and I am ashamed of having done that. The thing is, despite all of this I have only cried once in about 3 years and I am certain of that. It was when my ex and I broke up. I do not know why or how this happened but i cannot cry anymore no matter how hard i try. I hurt myself physically and mentally and nothing seems to do it. Every thought becomes more and more bloody and that and i even picture my familys reaction to it; nothing. I have become obsessed with trying to make myself cry and i even draw a hypothetical of what my suicide might look like. I will not be killing myself anytime soon because I am Catholic and do not want my family to feel bad; the whole shtick. But has anyone else not been able to cry or can you relate to any of this? I cannot talk about this to anyone else but i have some anonymity on here so i felt safe in posting this. Thank you. I cannot cry anymore.",1
"I do not really know what to do right now because I feel awful and I feel sad and I feel so out of it but also so stuck in my head. I do not even know how I feel and I hate how my brain always goes back to suicide no matter how much I try to kick the habit.I will tell my brain to stop, that I cannot rely on suicide, that it is getting old, but nothing I can do will make it stop. I am tired and I am tired of never seeing my therapist, and honestly, I do not really even believe in therapy anymore. And I am tired of taking medicine because I do not really think it is doing much to me except making me bored and uncreative. And I know that is not the case. I know that I crave off of feeling in extremes and that not feeling in extremes does not mean that I am not feeling at all and it is okay to be baseline sometimes and that does not mean that I am not capable of feeling, ever.I just feel that at this point, I have exhausted all options. Any time I actually felt better was just me being distracted. I feel like I am never going to get better. I can grow up and graduate college and become a CEO or get everything I could ever want or change the world in any way I want, and I would still think about suicide.I feel like I should just give in and accept its control over me. I am so tired of it at this point. it is not even manic depression anymore. it is burnout, it is frustration, it is desperation. giving in.",1

MONEY IS ALL THAT MATTERSAnd before anyone says ""Money will not buy you happiness"" or ""Fulfilment is what makes you happy"" you are fucking deluding yourself and you should be ashamed if you go around telling people that.When I see rappers like Lil Boosie flat out say money is the key to happiness I believe him not you!

"I apologize if my English writing is unclear. This is a bit of a rant. I have been very miserable for a very long time, at least in relation to how long I have been alive (16). My earliest memories of wanting to die was when I was 11ish, and it has not improved since. I find it very hard to find and keep close friends and I have no close relationship with my family. My parents are extremely socially conservative and do not take mental health seriously. My brother tried to commit suicide back in 2019 and even then they treated it as a ""mindset issue"". I cannot go to him or any of my other siblings because I do not have that type of relationship with them. We were pitted against each other at a very young age and the resentment is still there. It feels like getting professional mental health treatment is out of the question while I am living with my family, they do not even like to take me to the doctor. I do not feel like I have a future. For the past 2 months I have lay in my bed and felt miserable because I have been too afraid to get a job, or apply to things I need to apply to, or practice and get better at my one real extracurricular (fencing). I do nothing and I tell myself it does not matter because I am not going to reach the future anyways because I am going to commit suicide. But, I know I do not have the courage to do so, but I do not have the courage to fix my life either. When school starts in about 3 weeks I know I am going to have completely fucked myself over because in my school you are required to have a current resume, and they expect it to be constantly changing and evolving and I have nothing. I have done nothing in the past year and nothing to show. In addition, I enrolled to be in an internship program in which I can intern with local legal firms (police or lawyer), but I have not been even trying to contact these places. I have not because I am too afraid to call them when I cannot email, and none of the places I emailed have responded (from a month ago).The one extracurricular I have (fencing) I am not even good at, because I started in late October of last year and in comparison to my peers, all high level ranked, I am a joke. I started too late. I have no skills I am good at, because my parents generally ignored me for my siblings (who all succeed in the sports and arts they choose to do) and encouraged little from me. So I did nothing because I had no passion for anything.I cannot even leave my house and do the one thing I love to do anymore. I used to love to go on walks in nature but I cannot anymore. I hate going outside and feeling inferior to everyone. I do not even know why at this point. I cannot even admit to myself how bad I feel. Every time I do I cannot help but minimize my own problems. I cannot help but feel like there is no reason for me to feel as bad as I do ( I am middle class and have both parents in the picture). I cannot help but think everything I am listing is just stupid melodramatic teenage bull and its not worth hurting myself over (which it prolly is not). But it still just hurts my heart so much. I hate feeling like I am a waste of potential. I hate feeling like it is over. I am still very young. But I compare myself to my peers and my own family and I see nothing but cowardice and a waste. I want my parents and family to be proud of me so much. But I know this is unlikely. In addition to the lack of accomplishments, I am bisexual and my conservative parents (as mentioned above) would never accept me if they knew. I hate having to hide myself and I know if they ever found out they would tell me I am confused and a faker and a liar. Or, they would get rid of me completely.I am so afraid of the future and I am so afraid because I am going to have to reach it alone. I do not have any friends or family. The only person who has ever been proud of me is my fencing coach, but I do not know what he sees in me. I hate showing my face around our academy because I am so afraid of disappointing him. But I am always going to, because I am never going to be a good athlete. I do not know what to do anymore. But thank you for reading. I am hurting my future because I am a coward.",0

Cw for transphobia So a few days ago I had to fill out a form in front of my mom and as I was filling it out the gender option came up. As a closeted trans person I hesitated and my mom proceeded to call me crazy. I luckily convinced her that I was just reading what the other options were. As time went by she started calling me more gendered words to my birth sex and getting mad at me more often. She always trys to hug me or touch me and I hate so much usually she would get mad but lately she is doing it more and more often and getting more mad and when I do not let her she just instantly gets pissed and says get out of my face. When I was sick she said I am not sick but as soon as my sister said it my mom instantly went to help her and care for her. It felt like she was mocking me saying if you loved me this could have been you. Sometimes I wish my mom would just hit me because at least that way I would have a concrete valid reason as to why I hate her so much because with why I hate her right now apparently its not enough and I know I am just going to get she is religious she is not going to change just ignore it and its so annoying because now I am question myself as to if I am over reacting. Its so tiring having to live is with her and be on my guard all day. I do not feel safe in my home anymore and I do not have the option to move out right now as I am still way to young. Vent post,0
"I lost 90% of both mine and my parent's life savings that took us 10+ years to save up in the span of a year shorting the stock market last year. It started with a 5k loss that I could not let go of and now has ballooned to more than 90k+ the equivalent of more than 2 years of my salary. Had I invested in index funds I would have made 90k+ instead of the loss. The amount of money we lost and lost out on is staggering. While the vast majority of people made a killing last year not only did i not get any gains I lost so much in the greatest bull market in history. I just saw a report saying that the average wealth of Canadian households has ballooned to over 1 million whereas our family is left with almost nothing. it hurts so much more knowing I lost so much while everyone else got so rich. I know i was stupid in continuing to short but how does the s&amp;p500 go up more than 80% during a worldwide pandemic is beyond me. So not only are we pretty much all out of savings, the massive inflation we have currently has caused our monthly expenses to almost double. The amount of guilt is overwhelming, i single handedly ruined our financial future for at least the next decade and my parents have to bear the brunt of the consequences of my actions. They could have been retired by now but now have to work at least a few additional years due to my fuck ups. A once in a life time opportunity to increase our wealth and what do i do? I fucking lost 90% of our current savings. it is so hard to go on but I have to stay, cannot just off myself after losing all our family's money. Everyday is just so hard.Sorry for the rant, had to let it out. I cannot go on, the guilt is crushing",1
do not know if it is enough. Drinking with it so maybe it will work. Also scared. But also do not want to go on like this. No one supports me really. People do not really care. And they will pretend to care when I am dead. So I just took a bunch of pills,0
"After over a year of the worst my mental health has been in (suicide attempt, heartbreak, pandemic obviously, deaths in family, a lot of other shit) I thought finally something good is happening for me. I finally had a chance to escape my nightmare of a household with some people. they have already backed out.I do not think I am meant to be happy.And I do not know how much longer I can stay here without wishing for death I do not think I am meant to be happy",0
pleasei want to die so bad but there is nothing i can do it with reasons to live?,1
"Things I used to find fun just feel like a chore to do, and boring. I find it exhausting to even get of my seat. I have tried exercising, waking up earlier, eating healthily, meditation and so many other things but no matter what I do I just feel lethargic and even when I think about the future, I do not think Ill feel satisfied. Also, the career i want is to be a singer, but I have already tried and being a successful singer is almost impossible in this world. There is no other career i want other than being a successful singer, everything else is just un-fulfilling to me to the point that Id rather just end my life. I am starting to feel like giving up on being a singer, which means I do not want to live anymore as stupid and childish as it sounds. This is the only career I have ever wanted in my life, but its impossible. I have had a few jobs before but they made me feel like I was wasting my life and I am terrible with social interaction. Everything in my life just feels so boring and I used to have high hopes for my future and I used to be a happy person but that was like 5 years ago now. I do not know what to do Everything feels boring and the career i want seems impossible",0
"it is the most familiar emotional territory I know. Like being home. Do you guys also ""fetishize"" your depression? it is an objectively horrible feeling but there is a strange comfort in it at the same time. Hard to explain.",0

"I finally have to accept that there is nothing wrong with me.I do not have depression.I do not have anxiety.I do not have ADD.I am not autistic.I thought I might have some or all of these things, but no doctor or therapist has ever diagnosed me with them. There is no cure, because there is nothing wrong.I just do not belong here.I had hoped that one day Id have an explanation for why I do not fit in. For why I never made friends. For why I always get short, one word answers when I try to engage with others.I believed one day Id have a reason why I cannot develop hobbies or interests. For why I cannot be ambitious. For why I cannot find pleasure in anything.But there is only one reason.I simply do not belong here. I do not belong.",1
"My life feels like its slowly getting worse, wtf is wrong with me?here is my story, despite all these things happening it feels like I was happier at the time than I am now.1. Married an abusive psychopath of a woman, divorced about 5 years ago which was probably the best thing I have ever done for myself, did not get 50-50 custody of the kids.2. Dated someone really unstable after that, extremely messy breakup have not really been able to love or bond the same since.3. Burnt out at work shortly after. Before that I was on the line for a huge promotion. Since then I have never been able to focus or get through work like I used to. Started to struggle with suicidal thoughts 4. Met a really great woman that loves me way more than I deserve, supports me all the time. Its so weird I feel like a she will of the person I used to be and must suck to be around, why does she feel like this?5. Ongoing custody battle.6. Found another job which although not the promotion I had once hoped for pays really well and is my ideal job.At around 3 the depression hit, I hopped on meds for 6 months until the suicidal feelings passed, but after that I stopped taking the meds.Up until about then, I was still able to find joy in life, really small things like taking a walk, taking some photos, getting coffee, hanging out with a friend. I feel like my life has never recovered from items 1,2 and 3.I feel stuck, in an emotional and mental limbo. I cannot think about fun things, or holidays. I do not look forward to anything or want to be around people. COVID Lockdowns have just made it all worse.Am I still depressed? I must be, but I just do not know how to kickstart my life again. Real question, am I depressed? WTF is wrong with me?",0
"I just cannot do it. there is just so much shit to learn, its overwhelming, I could spend the whole day studying and I would not learn 1/100th of what I need to learn. I am most definitely not getting a job without a degree but I cannot do it, its too much. Tbh I just want to sleep and never wake up,it feels like life's over once you are done with High School I am failing college yet I feel powerless to do anything about it",0
"I got to thinking I should have been aborted, but then i realised i never would have met my best friend i never would have met my brothers and my sister, I never would have been taught how to ride a bike by my neighbours I never would have got to swim never would have seen all the group homes and facilitys where I have formed some of the closest bonds. I never would have got to smoke weed never would have got to smoke a cigarette I remember being broke in jail and that is still better than being in the grave. Even if I go back to jail broke cold and starving I still would not want to kill myself even if I ended up on the street humiliated lonely and hungry I still would not kill myself because there is allways something positive in life whether its smoking a cigarette or talking with your friend there is allways something to live for. I am glad I was born.",1
"This is my main account to show how serious I am. Idc anymore I just want a real reason why I should not do this now. I cannot imagine a life where I am actually happy and content. I cannot imagine much of anything going right. I have been fixating on suicide for 2 fucking years and I want it to be over already. I have lived my best years and they were awful. I have been posting random shit and commenting a lot more lately because I have been feeling so alone for too long. I get it, everyone has, but I am finally done with it. I give up. I guess what I really want now is just a distraction from everything around me. I have a noose on my lap and I really want to hang myself on the ceiling fan rn",1
"Writing this I am not depressed, just a depressing thought. I am so used to never being chosen first, and friends reaching out to hangout with me. Or ex's trying to make it work instead of leaving and probably never thinking of me again... ( Happened recently, dropped me like yesterdays paper) I do not feel value or wanted and it is a feeling I desire. But as an adult those things kind of leave you and you focus on yourself and hold those close to you closer. And maybe one day you will find the one who is been looking for you, in the mean time I am going to do the best I can and try to be my best self without relying on someone else for that support, because as I have realized people word does not mean anything and people change. But you will not change, you are stuck with yourself your whole life so become someone you enjoy being even if it is not easy or fun all the time. Hope someone reads this and can relate, it helps to know people feel the same way as you do I miss the days when people would reach out to me, and ask me questions, and miss me, and think of me before someone else.",0
Going to fucking kill myself. Nobody should have to live like this If I do not get the job tomorrow,0
Any reason to live past high school? So,1
"I think I am getting a therapist/doctor soon. I want to be honest but idk how they will react if I tell then about my thoughts. I am not really suicidal (no plan, never attempted before, never made a note) I just have thoughts about it constantly. What do they do if I tell them? Will I go to a hospital? I have seen some other posts where people got forced into the hospital for being suicidal but idk where they draw the line between needing to go to the hospital or not. What do doctors/therapists do if you say you have suicidal thoughts?",0
"I wish people were more honest and told me how they really feel. I wish I was treated the way I deserve to be treated. I wish my parents beat me as a child instead of trying to nice, bc all I really feel looking back at myself is that I deserved to be slapped. Still feel this way about myself today. I just wish people did not lie so much about how they feel about me. At this point I think all the compliments I have ever been given were just lies and pity. Truth is I am a fucking disappointment and I wish I was treated as such. I do not know why anyone bothers to hang out with me. I do not know why anyone pretends to like me. People admit to disliking me when I push them enough, why even put up a fake feeling in the first place? I am direct with people why cannot they be direct with me? I wish people were completely honest. Hey I actually find you hella annoying and I just hang out with you bc your really fucking clingey and its impossible to get you away from me why not just say that? I wish people were more mean to me",1

"...if you do not have a goal, life is a chore.My goal is to kill myself. Life sucks, and I do not have the courage to say it all again but life is overshit and I have reached the state where I do not think about killing myself but now I am at the step where you think when to do it and how to do it. I do not see any other way. I guess if I ring suicide hotline they will bring me to a mental ward... (in france) so no point.

"Guess should start of saying if you check my short post history I have obviously not went through with it yet. Although I have it currently planned out a lot better so I will go peacefully even if I kind of feel that would not be good for a part of the reason I want to go.Every day I am trying to further justify having no guilt wanting to kill myself. The latest reason is why do I have to emotionally suffer the death of my parents from old age/health issues? it is really not something I want to deal with (among many other aspects of life, some being a part of life bullshit, some my own doing), yet here I am born into this with only one true choice.There is lots of mentions of killing yourself is selfish, why? Surely it is just as selfish to produce a life and let it suffer at all the bullshit life has to offer? Or are people that want kids just delusional in some way? Have these people just never had any problems or just wilfully ignorant at what bringing a living thing into this world actually means? Why is producing life okay but having the choice to ending it not?",1
I feel like the only way to apologize for my actions is to take my own life. I feel like everyone is against me even my online friends I known for 2 years. I know that they really would not abandon me. I feel like I would be at peace when I am dead I thought the drama was over. I had been drowning in my own sorrow for I do not know how long. I decided to take a break. I cannot do this anymore. Everything feels like a lie to me. I feel like I am wasting away slowly,0
"I used to think I would either burn out into a pile of ashes or beat depression to become fiercely ""successful"". I am in a third place instead.I struggle almost every day to get through my normal responsibilities. I struggle to have an optimistic outlook on my future. I struggle to socialize as much as other people, not to mention maintain a romantic relationship. I struggle against my addiction to youtube and podcasts, my last standing vices to distract me when reality becomes too much. But rather than let those struggles get to me and because me to spiral downward, or letting those struggles fuel motivation for me to rise up and ""persevere"" through my suffering, I do neither. I say ""that is okay"". I wake up every single morning of every single day wishing I were not living the life that I am. that is okayI drown my awareness in free internet content to keep my conscious mind from having to face the totality of my situation. that is okayI contribute to the unsustainable consumption of non-renewable resources and rampant pollution across the globe that will devastate our species' well being and drive countless more to extinction. that is okayI feel my heart palpitate and strain to keep up with moderate exercise after years of sedentary life. I hear my ears constantly ring at different pitches after years of inexorable overactive stress. that is okayI'm not self destructing, I am not crashing out. I am just drifting off. I am sinking into quick sand. I am floating into open ocean. There is no catastrophe, there is no drama, there is only equanimity and surrender. Equanimity in Surrender",0
I know its hard to starve yourself and to actually die from it. But at least I can say it was not an impulsive decision. Long story short I came out of the hospital 3 weeks ago. That was the 4th time I have been in the hospital for trying to overdose and the social worker told my mom I could no longer manage my own meds. My mom has been overbearing all my life and I tried to keep things from her so that I could have a sense of control over my health and life. So this was devastating to me. I attempted to regain control by hiding all the new meds I picked up from the pharmacy and she found them. This was 2 days ago. I made a huge mistake at work and ended up giving a patient nerve damage after I injected a medication in the wrong spot. I can still see her glare full of hatred towards me. I do not belong in health care. I was going to be a doctor or a nurse but I am just going to end up harming or even killing patients from stupid mistakes. My lifes purpose was to help people but I cannot even do my job right. Life just is not worth living if I am going to harm patients. I have been thinking about this all day yesterday at work. I am refusing to take my meds and have just been eating junk food all day long. I have got my Mcat exam in 2 weeks and supposed to be starting dbt skills group in 2 days. But I could care less. I have got nursing school starting in fall. But all I can think about is just watching myself waste away. Its peaceful knowing I do not have to care anymore. Ill just get weaker and eventually pass out or something. And no one will know. I think I am going to starve myself,1
A brilliant video I came across that was helpful to me. Hopefully it helps someone else too. How self-forgiveness saved my life,0
Nothing else is happening to occupy myself so I am just dominated by all my bad thoughts and feelings I hate night,0
"Therapy is moving slowly because I cannot fucking talk, I always shut down. My meds are not working, self harm is never enough, and all I want to do is die but I do not know how and I can never find the right moment. Every day is a monotonous continuation of the previous one, I am in autopilot so often I do not even remember what happens anymore. I just cannot handle anything anymore and I feel like death. I just want this to end somehow, life feels more like a prison than a blessing, I feel trapped I feel so trapped",0
So many traps to fall prey to It really is a modern jungle out there..,0
Someone asked how do you think of dying. I said being kidnapped and tortured. A person commented saying masochist. I looked this up and I mean maybe its true? I did not think it had anything to do with sex but in this daydreams I am abused pretty bad sexually. Why do I think like this? Is it a common thing? I feel sick sometimes but I wish it would happen Masochist?,0
i doubt i actually intended to do it but i put a dog leash around my neck tied it around a towel rack in my bathroom (probably tied it wrong) and just sat on my tippy toes did not have the courage to fully sit and do it because I am worried ill suffer for like ten minutes and worried i could survive and end up with brain damage i was really close a few hours ago,1
"I am drowning in my expectations. My self imposed obligations. The perfectionistic standards I have for myself.Maybe if my mother had not had an eating disorder, I would not be counting calories and worrying about cellulite and bingo wings. Maybe then I would not hide behind long skirts and cardigans.Maybe if I had not been bullied, I would not spend hours preening and fretting over my hair and makeup. Maybe then I would not have forced myself through Accutane, nearly destroying my liver in the process. Maybe then I would not be drawn to the neutral, conventionally attractive clothing the world tells me I should wear. Maybe then I would not constantly worry about whether my shoes are shiny enough, or of I ironed my blouse enough.Maybe if I had been the better sibling, I would not work 60 hours a week, desperately trying to earn approval from my boss. Maybe I would not feel like I need to be the most accommodating, yet entertaining person whenever I visit home.Maybe if I was not born a woman, I would not feel the need to constantly perform. To be a perfect, daughter, a perfect girlfriend, hopefully to be a perfect wife and mother. As if that were not enough, to be pretty enough, to be thin enough, to be friendly and likeable and agreeable and well mannered enough to be seen as a woman of value. It hurts. I feel like a Madame Alexander doll, in a perfectly ironed dress, with perfectly coifed hair, and an empty smile, standing idly by my flower arrangement while I silently pray everyone likes the table settings and the food. I love my family, but I hate the voice in my head that nags and criticizes. I will not change. I crave the external validation too much. I love to be complimented on my carefully thought out veneer, knowing how much effort it required. It takes makeup and shapewear to be ingratiated into society, you know. In the meanwhile, I use drugs to numb it. Strong, heavy tinctures that cloud my brain and depress my body. Not so much that I relax my posture, but enough that my muscles can unclench. A trained eye could perhaps perceive, in photos, my glassy eyes, all but overshadowed by eye makeup and bleached teeth. Always dressed up, always smiling, always blank behind the eyes. I want to be a good mother one day, but this makes me question myself. I am my father, before his 10+ years of sobriety.I do not know how long I will live, or if I will die by my own hand. The perfect wife and mother would never off herself. Even dying under mysterious circumstances could bring suspicion. Not only that, but I have made a promise to care for my parents in their old age. Sometimes I wonder if having children would give me something to live for. Another strike against my qualification to be a good mother.I go through the motions, giving my all at work, in my private consulting, in my writing, hopeful that I will one day do something deserving of recognition and praise. I strive to be the best. One day, this drive may exhaust and overpower my body. Truly, only time will tell. I am suffocating trying to fit my idea of ""perfect""",0
Admitting to yourself that you have been doing the wrong things is painful. And right now I am going through that phase. This pain makes me just want to hop in bed and stare at the ceiling. But I think I can get past it. I feel like one of the biggest hurdles to getting better is that you got to admit to yourself that you have been doing things wrong for a long time,0
"A week, 2 weeks, a month, a year , I know it will not last it never dose, that sadness, that hole in me it will come back, it always dose, when I feel good its never to stay, I live in fear of when it comes back, ifs always on the back of my mind, I can hardly enjoy it will it lasts, I know my desire to die will be back sooner or later, years ago I though I was free the first time it happened, when it came back I realized I never was and probably never will be, Maybe I should stop fighting it, just let it happened when it comes back, enjoy the now and my slim success, and then let it all take me as if comes back, idk how many more times I can do this, maybe its best to end it on a high note, idk all I know is that If I keep going, this will just happened over and over again till can no longer take it, and there is noting I or anyone can do or stop it, what a life I know this normalcy will not last",0
"(Tw: suicide mention) I feel like nothing seems to excite me anymore. there is so much good in my life but for some reason I still do not feel happy. I am on meds, going to therapy twice a week, and yet I still feel like this. what is wrong with me? Its as if no matter what I do this numbness and emptiness is always there. Sometimes I can ignore it, but it never truly leaves. I know I cannot be happy as myself, no matter what happens. Its almost as if I have no choice, I know I am going to end up killing myself. Recovery seems too impossible, between school and friends and family I do not have enough time to get the help I truly need. I do not think there is anything that could even help me though, I guess I am a lost because. Everything feels so bland",0
"My SO broke up with me recently. We were together for almost half of my life. I were always a very withdrawn and introverted person. I have lost my entire social network over the years. And now that my SO is also leaving me, i have no one left. I still have feelings for this person but it feels so distant and cold at the moment. I do not know how to handle this emotional mess. I am not strong enough to let go but at the same time i do not want to bother them on their way to their happiness. I really want to see my SO happy but seeing them happy without me just breaks my heart. I have no one left to talk about this. I feel like a part of me has been amputated. I have never been so unhappy in my life. If i just were more a social person i could have prevent this. I really wish i were never born. My SO would have never met me and would not have to suffer by having to endure me. At least my SO can now be happy. I can never forgive myself for being such an awkward Idiot, sitting alone at home, prefer to do nothing out of fear to trust new people. I have not sleept or eaten properly since then. I hate myself.I wish i could disappear without an explanation.I do not know if i ever can move on.I will forever be alone, sitting in front of my desk, scrolling through the internet.

I am such a shitty selfish person. Even if I get better I cannot erase the hurt I have caused so what is the point? Living with constant guilt is eating me alive.Or maybe I am just really tired. I hope I feel better in the morning. Everyone in my life would genuinely be better off without me,1
"I feel sick for days on end because I do not eat enough and all I can do is lay in bed and listen to my stomach and smell the dirty dishes in the sink and think about how I have not washed my hair in days and feel more and more sick until I just go back to sleep to shut it all out. I do not feel sad, I just feel sick and exhausted and disinterested. I used to do so much like art and guitar and hikes when I was a teenager but now my interests just sit across the room from me collecting dust. On days I work I manage to get more done unless I just end up going to bed around 7pm when I get home. But usually I will have random bursts of motivation which will allow me to do cleaning and some hygienic things. it is so embarrassing because when my boyfriend gets home he just sees me laying in bed still at 5 or 6pm and he has to go do things and I have spent the day thinking maybe I will be able to drag myself out of bed if we can just go out and do something. But of course he is usually busy and even when we go do things I always come back here and feel like I just want to sleep. He helps do chores when I do not do them but I cannot expect him to pick it all up for me. And I am sitting here thinking I need to get my shit together. How can he be attracted to someone like this. How can I show up at my parent's house looking great and convincing them my life is going so well, just to go home and lay in bed again, and think about how my body is only going to deteriorate more the longer I lay here. I know I will not get my shit together though. it is weird to have people call you admirable and capable just because you have a half decent job or a degree but inside you do not feel like really anything half memorable or interesting. Just because I can read into what people are saying, or like to learn a lot, does not really mean I am any different from anyone else, and at the end of my life my interests will not actually mean anything or make a difference, because we kind of just live and then die, and that is it. I have health conditions that also make functioning just hard for me, POTS and structural issues. Makes it hard to walk around sometimes, to just get up, to stay active and feel full of energy. And I do not think my emotions are too related to that, it just combines into a larger hurdle for me to overcome.I dunno. I do not feel a lot. it is the fact that I do not feel a lot, and when I do I sob like a child and my heart feels like it is about to explode, and then I go back into this numb, hungry sleep until the next time I am alive enough to feel pain again. This is rambly and borders on nonsensical but I am just saying what I am thinking. I certainly talk to some people in my life about my feelings but all that is done is made me realize I sound like a broken record, and after a point they do not need to ask why I am crying or why I bailed on all of the plans, because they have heard it about a million times. Breaking out of the cycle feels impossible",0
"My brother is like my best friend. We are close enough in age that we always were together. Before his depression hit, he stayed at my house often and my daughter and him were very close. 3 years ago his depression hit hard and he kind of just dropped off the face of the earth. We did not know how to deal. It took 6 months of him dodging our calls and texts with the guise of being to busy with work and his PhD for us to call him out. He said he just needed time. Then the pandemic hit. We forced him to get help recently. He is now back home and starting to adjust. How do I help him through it? I text him everyday, but I do not want to overwhelm him How to help?",0

I live with my mom and my siblings, my siblings do not want to hang out with me. My mom is all that I have, but we do not do anything together other than talk. So that still leaves me bored throughout the day. I literally sit on the computer all day, and when I am not on the computer I am walking around the house looking for something to do or in bed. People who I think are close end up ghosting me like I am nothing to them. I am just so exhausted. I do not have anything to do during the day, let alone anyone to spend time with. I am tired of spending everyday alone",0
"I am not saying this to have anybody feeling bad for me, or to get any type of pity. I am serious and it does not really matter who I am or how old. All I know is that I cannot take it anymore. I wish my life would change for the better but every year, month, day, its getting worst. I lost all my faith, joy, motivation, I do not have any goals anymore. Somebody or something, should I say completely tore me down. I do not have any hope anymore, I know things will not get better, it can only get worst now. Its weird because I suffer so much but at the same time, I am completely numb. I just want to end this pain. Also, life does not any meaning for me anymore. I give it the end of the year, if nothing changes or only for the worst, Ill end my life. that is it. When Ill be dead, I may go to heaven or feel nothing which is way better than the pain I am in right now. If I would have known what my life would have been and I could have chose, I would have decided not to be born. And please do not judge, because nobody, I think wants to die, its just that we want to end the pain, suffering. that is unfair but that is it, cannot change things now. If nothing changes in the next few months, like end of the year, I am going to end my life and I am very serious.",1

"I still want to kill myself and I still think I would do so at the wrong moment, but arguably the biggest point of conflict is the complicated relationship between my parents and my mental state.Parental love is a funny kind of relationship. I think everybody can empathize with the fact that most parents, objectively, spend more time raising children than anything else. Despite everything, they want us to succeed. They love us more than life. And still they can hurt us worse than this big bad world ever could. They seem to operate under this mantra that ""If you can take this, then you can be in the unforgiving world"" but it is so much different than that. The world cannot make me feel worthless, or like a burden, or like a waste of time. But you, my parent, have the only emotional tether that makes those feelings possible. Nothing I have experienced in every day society has ever made me feel emotionally weak. It is always those close enough to judge me and my lifetime's worth of choices that can bring that out in me.I am 24 years old and I just moved back in with my parents. that is already the worst feeling ever. I first moved away for college when I was 18, and despite some hardships was able to make my way up until about 2 months ago when my mom decided it was financially responsible for me to come back home. So that fast, my independence is gone and I am once again, no more than my parents' child. A 24 year old man. I do not know if you have ever heard about Jennifer Pan, but my situation is very much like hers was. Only I do not want to kill my parents. I want to kill myself.I learned in my psychology class that statistically, in men, suicidal tendencies reach their peak midway through the healing process, because it is where both suicidal thoughts and confidence are at their highest. Apparently I have experienced a lot of growth this past few months and according to my mom, it is undeniable how much better I am at handling adult responsibilities than I was when I moved in. I have recieved all kinds of verbal reassurance from her lately, because she knows how easily I get down on myself. She does not yet know how intensely I want to not exist, but she does know I have terrible self confidence. And on top of that, she knows that I am manic in a medical sense. So it is unbearably easy for me to transition from happiness to thoughts of death in a matter of minutes. Seconds, even. She does what she can to be a part of my healing but suicide is the one taboo that might actually help.But we cannot talk about it. The mere idea of losing me breaks her heart into pieces. She does not even like to think about me dying by accident, let alone from something like suicide.What she does not understand is that the only way we can talk these thoughts out of me is if she is brave enough to acknowledge that it is not about her. it is so convenient for her to have such a powerful shield because when she really wants to chew me out, she mentions my flaws, my mistakes, my mindset, everything wrong with me past and present. And all I want to do in those moments is to end my life, but she does not have to experience that part because she knows that I love her enough to never go there.More than anyone else, she can make me want to kill myself, but because we will never discuss it, she can suspend her disbelief enough to treat me like someone who is not at risk. The one thing I need to talk about, and the person who talks about everything else with me is selectively deaf about it. I love her more than breath but it just is not fair. Am I just selfish?",1
"Hi. My friend has clearly stated that they were planning to commit suicide. I do not know them IRL. I have just met them recently because of a post where they were talking about how they wanted to end it all. I am incredibly scared and I have no idea how to help.I would talk to my parents, but they do not know that I have Reddit and they would probably care more about that than the fact that someone was going to fucking die. I do have a counselor that I can talk to, but I am not sure if they would even be able to help.I am not sure what to do from here. If there are any resources I can use to help them, please let me know. My friend needs help",1

"I complained about a bill that did not make sense n my Dr office wanted to send a letter saying I am not allowed to go there anymore but that did not work out so then I get medical insurance they do not accept n they say it is illegal to pay out of pocket, so I am backed into a corner n have to go elsewhere, but my Dr being a good Dr referse to another office where I can still see the same Dr but they say they cannot accept my ins either. I might be able to still see my Dr if billing will work with me but otherwise iam basically getting booted bc I got medical assistance ( to pay for pregnancy n miscarriage related bills that were unexpected ). I am going thru a lot right now and just want to see the Dr I trust bc I have real trust issues n I honestly feel attacked by the billing people bc I disputed an error n called them out on it, and for that I am being punished and cannot continue therapy with my Dr of five or more years or get therapy at either of that drs office. I need help for real but I am scared to press things further bc I have already been punished for questioning billing. I just want to get help",0
"They were so attractive to me. I loved them obsessively. It was not love, it was passionate obsessive desperate lust. I would have done anything to touch their pale pink body. I longed desperately to taste them. To tie them up, lick, and kiss their back slowly. I would make love to them. Breathe heavily I to their ear. Thrust my fingers inside them, lick and suck the juices off. The sound of their moans if pleasure sent my spiraling. I wanted to hear them cum so hard they began to cry, cough, and gag. I wanted to see their eyes roll back into their skull and watch their legs go numb from over stimulation. I wanted to force my tongue deep inside their anus and the slide it on just to lick, tease, and edge their puss for hours.I wanted every inch of them. I would have sucked their toes if they let me. it is maddening. I wanted a cock just so I could fuck them. It was the first time I understood penis envy. I would imagine myself getting hard and watching them stroke their clit and drip with desire, begging to get penetrated. Desperately widening their legs and panting like a dog breathing heavily with those sexy pink plump lips of theirs. I could barely take it. They drive me insane. I needed to touch them. To hold them. To kiss them. I felt like I would die if I could not have a single taste. I did not care if they did not love me. I did not care if they did not want me. I thought about them ever day. Every second. I still think about them. I am salivating just thinking about tasting them. The universe is without mercy. I miss those lips, above and below your belt. I feel like dying. Is it wrong to long for someone so hopelessly? I fell In love with an FBI agent",1
"Things like acne and a crooked nose may be brushed off by some people. However, if they are causing you do lose sleep, cry and hate yourself they are to you what some, seemingly much more severe things are to others. You are not an ungrateful brat for this. it is okay to be depressed because you are balding, or because you have never had a gf/bf. Just because you have not been abused or had a horrible life does not mean your feelings are less ""valid"". Different things hurt people in different ways.",0
"TW: CSAI'm 19 years old. I am unemployed, i do not go to school. I live in an abusive enviroment with my grandfather who sexually abused me as a child and its not easy to just put his ass in jail like so many people have advised me to do. My mother is just as depressed as me and sometimes we do not get along and she can get hella abusive. Sometimes she will go as far as ganging up against me with my grandfather.My grandmother just died a month ago. I lived with her since I was 11 and honestly it traumatized the shit out of me. She was only 64 years old and died of a massive stroke. IT came out of nowhere and I have had physical symptons of grief. I feel like throwing up. I could not sleep.People expect me to just get over my situation and just become this great person after my grandmother died and its just making the suciidal feelings worse.I have extreme social anxiety. I am extremely insecure. My father is a deadbeat and does not give a shit. My mother does not understand me. My grandfather is a narcissist.My friend just tells me to get over it because her parents are worse and i do not have the right to feel this way.My therapist is not helping me. I do not feel heard. I just feel like I am not a prioity for them.I just want to fucking kill myself. Everything is messed up",0
"I deal with severe depression that is proving to be treatment resistant over the past 5/6 years. My rumination and anxiety is totally out of control. I have tried almost all SSRI/SNRIs, on Prozac now for the second time. Antidepressants seemingly do nothing for me. But like I said my rumination and anxiety is totally ruining my life. Benzos are the only thing that help but I cannot be prescribed them for daily use. Thinking about asking my doc about trying a mood stabilizer or a low dose antipsychotic. I need to slow my brain down. Maybe low dose seroquel would be able to accomplish that? But I am just curious as to what meds helped some of you guys get your rumination and anxiety under control? Desperate to find something to slow down my thoughts and ease my anxiety. Thanks for any help. What medication helped your rumination?",1
"Over the months its felt like everything has become horrible except a couple of things. I am staying inside my house almost every day. I do not know where my life is going and what is the purpose. My social life feels like lackluster of meaningful friendships with other people besides my very close friends. It feels like all girls I talk to ignore me. I am not doing anything weird to them except being friendly. The one girl who I thought I actually liked a lot turned out to be gay. I do not know what I am doing wrong. My life feels like its mundane and lacking so many good things. Everyday I realize how bad it is. I am starting to question what is the purpose of life if it feels like I am stuck in the same position for the past fuckin months. I keep saying to myself that is its going to get better, but its starting to feel like it not change and I will end up hurting myself. I do not know what I am doing wrong in my life",0
"I keep using distractions to cope with how I feel. I watch Netflix and go on my phone for hours. I hate doing it and as a result of doing it for so long I feel so bored. But I cannot stop because the second I do I am reminded of what life is actually like. I hate it here. So many social issues, health issues, and climate issues. Not to mention my own problems. I genuinely want to die. Honestly do not see the point. What the fuck am I supposed to do with my life? I wish I never existed. I feel bad saying that though because I know the people around me would be so hurt. I just have this pain in my heart that will not leave. No matter what I do. I do not want to be here anymore. I just do not think life is worth all the trouble. I hate it here",1
I am a combat veteran and a sexual abuse survivor. I am also married with 2 kids. My wife is tired of my shit my alcolism my habitual lying. I have never hurt her physically or cheated on her but I have definitely hurt her emotionally. I am so tired of doing that. I really wish I could finally kill myself I have tried without success. I have been separated for about 1 year and I am on 10 different psych meds I do not know how much I can take. I have hurt everyone that has ever lived me,1
Wtf. I do not know why I am feeling this way. I had a great night at a concert and made out with my crush and just overall had a great time. Fast forward 2 hours at a bar and I just want to find a time to leave because I hate myself and feel like I am the worst one there and everyone is judging me. Wtf? All my friends are with girls rn and my roommate who I usually open up to is out of town. Hes one of the only people in the world that knows what I am going through but I do not want to bother him when hes on vacation. I honestly feel like if there were a gun in my apartment Id use it on me. what is going on? Why do I feel like this? I guess you could say I hang out with the popular crew so idk maybe that is why I am feeling like shit cuz I am always comparing myself. But damn its not easy when I feel like everyone is doing so good and doing better than me. I just feel like I do not know how to act around people and everyone is living life pretty damn well. I went to a really good college but kind of have an average job so that probably contributes to the lack of confidence. This blows. The only reason I do not do it is cuz I love my family and I know how heartbroken they would be what do I do Just want some help please,1

"I am in an increasingly bad mental state. I just moved to Austin, Texas a few months ago with my girlfriend and things have been spiraling out of control for the both of us and I am starting to feel there is no fixing things. I am terrified of being alone, I have social anxiety, and I have become too dependent on her which has taken its toll on her mental health. I am facing repeated thoughts of just wanting my life to be over, I am so tired of feeling like such a worthless piece of garbage, I am tired of feeling so alone all the time and that nobody cares. I have debated trying to OD on my seroquel, or OD on drugs like cocaine, I really wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up. I do not know anyone here, my girlfriend wants to leave me, I am just a fucking mess and I hate myself so god damned much.I am trying to do the right thing, I have been getting denied insurance coverage for TMS and EDMR therapies to deal with my mental illness and the longer it gets drawn out the worse things have been getting. I am tired, I just want to be loved, and I do not even love myself, how can I?? My mom died of suicide at a far younger age than I am now, and I also think I just wish so much that I could be with her. If she was still here my life would not have turned out so shitty, I would not have had to deal with emotional abuse and neglect from my other family members after she died, I would not be a fucking alcoholic addict that cannot handle just day to day living.What sucks the most is that I know what I am capable of, I know I am an intelligent person with a good job, but this depression, this trauma, this anxiety, it makes me step in my own way and I am losing that battle a little bit more every single day. I know I am the only one who can truly overcome this, but in actuality, I do not think I am capable. I do not know what the tipping point will be but it feels like its getting close, I am one tragic event away from just blowing my brains out. Nobody would even know, I do not want people to mourn me when I die, if I felt otherwise, I would be much further off from suicide. I am so far from home, my girlfriend does not love me or want to be with me anymore, I have no friends here, I am like a literal fucking ghost. I have two cats and a dog at home that I love so much, but my girlfriend would care for them if I were gone, she loves those animals to death.I am running out of reasons to stay alive and it is scaring the hell out of me.

"My whole life I have suffered, I am 17. Never had a girlfriend, grew up far to poor. Have no money, no job nor barely any friends. I hate myself a lot, I get sad at night and eat a lot during the day. I do not know what the problem with me is. I feel unwelcome in this world. I hate school, god I hate school. I have one more school year left before I graduate. Then I do not know what I am going to do. I never had a job before, I am very very scared to get one. I do not have my drivers license or permit, I am scared to drive. I have not been to a doctor ( mental health) before. Usually depression hits older people but why me? I am very upset with myself. Maybe I was just born to be sad? I have been made fun of, bullied both physically and mentally. For various reasons such as obesity, being in special Ed, having no friends and never having a girlfriend. I hate myself. My family do not care about me nor does anyone else. I am not ready to die yet, I have alot of things to do with my life before I die. Wtf am I still doing here?",0
"I have no friends, no family, no social interaction since the pandemic. For the past few months I have been dreaming of travelling to Europe and see places I always wanted to see however it starts to look impossible this summer. I have worked hard to earn money for this trip. Soon I have to work term and will not have time do anything. If I do not start working I will probably go into a lot financial trouble. If I do I will probably underperform due to severe depression due to isolation and cannot keep the job. I had suicidal thoughts my whole life and have a few failed attempts. I have been trying to keep my morale high and improving myself greatly past few years however the suicidal thoughts are back since the pandemic are I cannot stand living anymore. Social isolation is literally hell and I really wanted to make that trip to make up for my wasted youth. I really need some advice. I do not want to start working I just want to live a little I think I earned it with all the hardwork I put into my future and my finances. If I start in this mental state I will most likely get fired because I really need a break from what I have been through all my life (abuse from family and not being accepted by others all my life, just as I started to fix what is wrong with me and started making friends for the first time the quarantines started). If I do not financial trouble. Either way I really do not have any hopes for the future anymore suicide is starting to sound rational again. Almost 1.5 years of isolation.",1

"How do I handle someone constantly complaining and negative and down, and trying to always support them and help them while being depressed myself but a huge people pleaser. My partner shows when they are down, everybody will know it. They will complain all the time and not really talk to me, and it will be like that everyday for days. They wanted to move to another country to study and and I chose to go with them as I could not handle the relationship to end. I studied hard for an exam to be able to get in and gave a lot of effort, just for them to tell me that they will be depressed there too, and do not know why the changed countries in the first place and so on. It is something they really wanted and now that they got it they are not satisfied .I know what it is like to be depressed, so I am not saying everything should be fixed, but nothing is appreciated and everything is being complained about, and I try so hard. I am numb and tired but even when I am at my worst I will still talk to them and try my best to make them laugh and smile. I am not actively suicidal but I wish every night to not wake up. Sometimes they even say that a lot of their negative emotions come from me and my family situation, which I cannot change. It is like no one has it as bad as them.

"I am honestly not doing so fucking hot. I have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. I really do not know what is going on with me. At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone more than anything. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but all I want to do is cry. Fuck, I need a hug. vent",0

I sometimes think about this and feel like there is no point now for me to be here, to stay strongIm not very good looking, at least it definitely appears that way- I have only ever been rejected or let down nicely, and on top of that I get shy around girls I like and I am awkward.I have only ever been average or below at everything, I am not popular or anything, so I do not rlly get invited to like parties or anything , which especially sucks bc its summer- and I usually have to be the one to set up hang outs with my 2-3 friends The only thing really keeping me going is that my 16th birthday is in November and I do not want to miss thatGiven all this, I feel like sometimes I do not want to be here anymore, and that things could never get better and all I really ask for is for someone to tell me its going to be ok or tell me I am wrong in my thinking with reasoning, please?

"I have struggled with depression/anxiety for many years. Although I had a tough/traumatic childhood, my life now is pretty peaceful. Married to a wonderful man, no debt, own our home/cars, about to finish grad school etc. But for some reason, I cannot seem to shake the idea of worthlessness. I have no solid friends, and have many broken relationships. I chalk it up to anxiety/akwardness when around others- but my initial thoughtis that I am unlovable or a bother. I assum I am unlikable, therfore I most likely manifest those beliefs into reality. I feel stuck. And I feel like an imposter because my career is focused in mental health. Perhaps because I have been doing the same thing day after day for so long? No outside hobbies? Little drive to interact with others as it exhausts me? I do not have a plan or a strong desire to end my life. But I sure as hell think about it a lot. And that alone, is exhausting in itself. Ideations",1
"Should I end it? Should I just quit? No one would notice, right? Its not like anyone hesitated to leave me, bothered to notice me or bothered to help me. Will they be bothered by my passing? I do not know. Do I want to find out? Yes. Yes I want to, I am only 14 and I am beginning to think there is no way out of here except this way. Should I end it?",0
"I am moving into my partners home, after being trapped with my ex-fiancee and her family, where I am not welcome to be anywhere but my room. as moving day gets closer, the worse i feel. I have been suicidal before, but I have never felt so serious. so content. my new partner means the world to me, he is kind, caring, and he understands me, but I am scared I am not good enough, I am to broken, to be with him. that ill only weigh him down. that he is better off without me, though i know he would not agree. i do not know if I am going to be able to talk myself out of it anymore, and there is no where else for me to go. everyone tells me there is better options, but there is not. its either live my life as my exes pet, move here and ruin the life of the best person I have ever met, or end it all. and i cannot be her pet anymore, and i cannot ruin him.I am out if options i do not know what to do",1
"People say ask for help, resources are there. I was LahoreBut no that is not true. I live in Canada for fucks sakes and the suicide hotline left me on read. Also, nobody ever considers that maybe some people who want to die do not have. Chemical imbalance. Maybe some of us because pain and suffering to others. Maybe some of us are narcissists, liars and mean. Yet, we still have enough mental capacity to understand the harm we do, and reasonably conclude that suicide is the best option. I am not going to commit suicide because I love the people close to me. I am not going to do it because I do not care about those close to me, and I hate discomfort. And its probably a painful thing to do. Its a bullshit",1
"My relationship with my family. We do talk but I feel like my sister especially does not give me much respect and can be quite insulting. My in laws can be very overbearing and bossy. Having to work in general I struggle with and even after years I find it makes my life miserable (I know Id feel the same in any job). Always running out of money too soon. I hate myself sometimes because I do not have a very strong personality (in an assertive way) and I am lazy. When I start to show more confidence people just take it as a sign of mania and give me a hard time about it. I just feel like a pathetic person sometimes because I struggle with life stuff and I find it hard to get on with others a lot. I feel so passive and weak. Part of me just wants to escape. There is good in my life but I think I take it for granted. I have a fianc, a house, a dog but its hard to think going to work is worth it. I do not want more than what I have I just want to improve myself to become an improved version of myself without manic accusations. I feel like I am living in some weird dystopian film. Everything seems a bit shitty",0
"Idk why I still bother to reach for help when i know nobody can truly help me. I suppose it is just better to get it out of my head. I seriously feel like I might act on my thoughts. My mental health has declined dramatically and I find myself losing control more frequently and for longer periods of time. I have made plans and they are always the same plan. it is just a matter of having the right combination of circumstances active at the right time for me to act on it. I have reached out for medical help but the truth is, nobody will really do anything unless you are about to act on it that very second you call or until it is too late. I get into strange headspace where I do not really have control of myself and that is when I act strange and am likely to act on it. So I will not ring anyone or ask for help in those time... which makes it more scary because i do not truly want to die. There is nothing i can do. Sometimes I think maybe I should stop trying to help myself and just let it happen because I am sick of being stuck where I am right now I do not know why I am writing this",1
"I am not depressed or at least I do not think I am in an episode.I just feel so fucking dead inside.I feel so apathetic about literally everything.I cannot sleep well because I lost my job and I do not do anything physically during the day anymore. I do not want to look for new jobs because job hunting is trash.I start college in the fall so even if i do find a job I will only be able to work a little.Parents are in my ass about college enrollment when I am doing my best. I do not care about spending my life on anything better then quick little bursts of dopamine like videogames, weed, sex, internet, and memes.I do not care if I live for tomorrow or die right this minute, I could not care for a single heartbeat.The only thing that keeps me alright is my boyfriend but too much of that is unhealthy too and I would die before I ruin this relationship.Just so fucking dead inside.

"I am going to tell you that my mom and as dad are the best parents that a man like me could ever ask for and I am sorry for ending my life short. This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

"Certainly did not think Id be reaching out on reddit to express how I am feeling but here goes nothing. I have a long standing history of depression &amp; trauma however over the years I have bounced back and become quite happy and high functioning. Over the past 7 months my mental health has significantly declined and everything in my life has just gone sideways. Firstly I was given a very harsh wake up call about the career I thought I wanted and almost had my graduation delayed - something that kickstarted an entire depressive state &amp; identity crisis for me. I cannot put the mental turmoil this put me through into words. Since then I have broken up with my partner of 5 years after realising I did not love him anymore &amp; meeting someone else. I just finished 11 weeks of unpaid work for my degree and have just found out yesterday that I need to repeat 6 of them and now I am going to graduate late. This was meant to be a huge achievement for me, finishing all my clinical hours for my degree now its been taken away from me for the second time this year as I required some days off for my mental health and they cannot pass me on the amount of hours I have done and they cannot leave the hours in finalised so I have to repeat entirely. All of my friends will be finishing the degree without me, and my ego and pride is too strong I am just so embarrassed by this. Its devastating me. I am on thin ice with my employer and about to lose my job because of how unreliable I have been and they can tell I have had a behaviour change and totally withdrawn. I keep having flashbacks of childhood abuse and cannot sleep at night. I feel numb and empty inside and like I am stuck and everyone else is moving around me. I have been disassociating from reality and losing hours and days and weeks worth of time. I do not know where the last few months have gone. To top it off Two nights ago I was walking back to my car when I was grabbed and forced behind a wall and had my head smashed against bricks a few times and I was sexually assaulted. I am replaying this over in my head and do not know how to voice the way I feel about this. I feel fucking disgusting. I feel so alone and like nobody understands this. I am really struggling to cope with life and I am just sitting in bed wishing I could go to sleep and never wake up. This is the first day in years that I have seriously considered ending things and I feel like I am at rock bottom Not coping",1
"I am so done with myself at this point. I wake up past noon everyday because I cannot sleep at night. I have very little friends but the ones I do have depression and come to me for help (they do not really know about my mental state) and I feel like I am no help. I make everything worse for them. I constantly feel like shit. And I always wonder what is the point of getting up. I just do not know what to do anymore. They say, ""Roll with the punches in life"" but at this point it is a pro boxer punching me and I am this close to getting KO'd. I cannot even cry anymore, I feel like an empty she will. Life sucks",0
"So, hello and sorry if this post sounds whiny, I will delete it if it does. I am 21m and for as long as I can remember, my life has been miserable. I was bullied in school, had almost no friends, and so found solace in locking myself in my room and wasting time on the computer. This lasted from about 10 to 15. Since then, I have spent my time regretting my life thus far and desperately trying to turn things around, unsuccessfully. The whole situation with COVID and the lockdowns worsened my depression because I no longer was able to do anything of value with my time, since I was stuck in an abusive household where everything I did was ridiculed. I feel old and broken.Anyway, sorry for ranting, but I needed to take all this off my chest. Depression stole my youth",0

Priests, therpists, nobody has any damn answers. They all say 'I do not know' or just empathize with no meaningful answer.I nearly killed myself last night, the government has permenantly severed my family in two. I cannot walk outside my house without gov approval and decades of anti-hitler rhetoric is a joke, people want a dictator again.

"We need to stop pretending like it will. Playing the distraction game to kill the time until the universe decides to deal us out a new hand is not a sustainable idea. Odds are good that if we do not choose to get better, do not choose to alter the path were on in favor of ourselves, that these lives we lead full of pain and regret will continue the way they have been heading. (A downward spiral.) We get on average 75 years on this planet. that is it. it is time to decide for ourselves what is worth our attention. Decide what is worthwhile to you, what in life is worth the time and effort you would use to accomplish the goals you want to achieve. What actions can you engage in that would truly give you a sense of fulfillment based on your principles and morals, instead of based on what is good for your wallet or your social standing. We all want to be loved, but it is hard to love someone who hates themself. Make the choice to improve yourself, it is possible to change the people we are It will not get better by itself.",1

Why should not I die? I cannot remember anymore. Everything hurts, everything's confusing. Everything's killing me. Yet I am still alive.I honestly wish I am dead. I would feel suicidal every day and when I try to kill myself I cannot remember why. My mind would just go blank, and my suicide attempt would be almost a subconscious act. Even so, I still think it is better to die than be alive.Why am I saying this anyway? I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest?A few weeks ago I felt like I was going crazy.

Honestly he is too shitty. Is it alright if I just be indifferent to him? I would want to hear from someone who is suffering from depression and is a parent- how do you want your ward to react and deal and help you and bear with the inevitable consequences? How to deal with your parent who is in depression?,0
I am blanking on my age. I legit cannot remember if in 23 or 24 and I am completely ambivalent to figuring it out. The only care I have is wanting to figure out or fix the reason why I do not care. Anyone else just have multiple mini breakdowns in a week? like mini mini cuz I often am just driving and then tear up but as soon as a single tear falls I am done. the feeling is gone and I am numb for the next few hours but still left with the realization that I feel like shit or the memory of that feeling. idk if I am disassociating or if its some toxic masculinity thing but fuck it and this sucks.

"Recently, it is become a chore for me to get out of bed in the mornings. I do not find any desire to read or watch movies anymore like I used to. If I do end up cracking open a few pages or sitting down to watch a film, I do not even finish what I start. My sister made a joke a while ago that I am like a robot because I had cut all ties with friends just because I could. Maybe I am a robot. I definitely feel like one if I do not even feel a sense of remorse about pushing people away. I do not even have the desire to build or rekindle relationships. I do not see the point. After my work day is finished, I make a beeline home, and pop a melatonin so the day finishes up quickly. I just want to disappear back into my dream world. Time does not exist there and it is okay for me. It just sucks when I hear my alarm blaring into my ears the next day when I just want to curl back into my own world. Why should I wake up, anyway? Everyone tells me that better things are going to happen soon, do not give up, you will get there, blah blah blah. it is all repetitive and I am honestly done hearing that bullshit. I have gone through group therapy, intensive therapy, and I see my own therapist and I think I am just done. If anything, I just want someone to listen right now. Maybe someone might tell me something different. You know, it was way better to make up excuses when I was sad about something, but what happens when I do not feel anything at all? &amp;#x200B;Anyway, thanks for reading. I do not feel anything.

"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this. I do not see any other way out",1

"Hi, I am early 20s (M) in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself. The relationship was quite one-way I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back, I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional help/counselling recently that i self-referred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoors(vague i know) and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland? Especially at this ageI appreciate it is a lot/huge ask, the amount I have went through just gets so overwhelming to process and I am just so lost and want guidance; i do not know what to do/where to go. I guess it is just so hard to see the wood for the trees, and I do not know what to do and cannot see how things will get better. I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve, which makes me feel more hopeless. I want to get out of this rut I have been in for so, so long and to feel loved/validated again and feel good about myself again, as cheesy as that may sound. Sorry for a low-post I do not like putting it upon people Crippling Loneliness after grim breakup",0

"For context. I am a young adult under 25. I choose not to disclose my age because I am paranoid that this might come across someone I know. And let us call my boyfriend M. M and I have been together for around a little over a year now. The story I will tell you happened either at the very first month of our relationship or before we were even official. So for context. At january 2020 (before I knew M) I went on to omegle to chat with strangers. Specifically sext with them. Admittedly in my mind I always viewd sexting as watching porn. Especially if it is with a stranger, it is like watching a cam show. But everytime I did it I felt awful and guilty afterwards, just like with porn. I only did this two-three times. Here comes M. I liked him a lot, but with covid and whatnot we could not meet properly. As I am writing this I am going through a stressful period in my life, and I wish this memory was the only unpleasant one to arrise. But this is the one that shocked me the most. As I lay in my bed, in the middle of a panic attack a few weeks ago my brain suddenly had the thought ""you are a cheater"" and I thought back ""no I am not! I would never cheat on M"". And then my brain thought ""Yeah you are, remember the last time you sexted how guilty you felt for M?"". I was mortified. I had completely forgotten about the last time I sexted.I went on omegle and found a random stranger with whom we sexted. At the time my mind was still thinking of sexting like watching porn. But then something clicked. When I send a breast pic back I realised, what the hell, this is an actual person on the other screen. So I deleted that picture, my account and completely left the sexting game. As I destroyed my account, along with it were destroyed any evidence of WHEN this event took place. After searching I have come to two possible scenarios. It happened in march when we just knew each other or it happened in october (which I doubt it because October was was warmer than March and I was wearing very fuzzy clothes). Now after this thought came to my head, my brain cannot let it go. it is been three weeks since it came back up and my brain is always telling me ""you are a cheater, kill yourself, you hurt M, your family will find out and kick you out of your house, M will publicly humiliate you and your friends are going to leave you, you will be homeless and alone as you deserve"". I am going to see a therapist in a month or so, but I do not know if I can hold on till then. I have no friends who I consider friends, just friendly people, so no support system. I worry that if I break up with my bf I will be completely alone and I will go back to self harm or I will kill myself. I cannot live with myself. And the think is, say I tell this to bf and he breaks up with me. What if the event did happen in March when we first knew one another? At the end of the day, I am confused and scared, I do not want to be a bad person. I do not. I do not want to feel like if this happened in october I should kill myself as punishment. It just, it feels like I should genuinely physically harm myself if I did this, I cannot believe how dissapointed I am in me. To think I would destroy the best thing that ever happened in my life. I am fucking worthless I do not expect your pity but dear god please I do not want this",1
She always tells me that she does not want me to hate her and she does not like telling me out of fear that she has used it. she is just getting worse.I love her man i really do. But am I a bad person for not leaving when its clear I am just making her feel worse about herself?A different perspective could be nice Friend has started using cocaine...,0
"So this is my first time posting on Reddit, apologies if I mess up. To make a long story short, I failed my first year of college. My parents are okay people. they have done some bad stuff to me in the past, but I know they love me so I try to not put it against them. So my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college. Thing is, after COVID restrictions, my mental health went down, way down. I was hardly showing up to my online classes, hardly doing assignments. I failed most of my classes both semesters. I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this. They are going to pay off the loan today, and its killing me inside. I do not know if they will find out I failed this year or not, but either way I feel that I am such a horrible child, even if I cannot help my mental illness I could have reached out. I do not even want to go to college anymore. I do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass, I want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans. I cannot go on, I feel like a walking failure for not just doing my work. Why did not I do it? what is wrong with me? I hate myself so much, why cannot I just be a good child to my parents? I cannot do anything right so I feel like the only way to repent is to die any advice is appreciated I am such a horrible child",1

"My city is in flames and I am barely holding on I feel like my family are oblivious to what is going on, I cannot believe my life is just getting worse and worse along with everyone else here but I am truly scared as I feel I have nothing left in me. I almost want to end it before something even more traumatizing happens. I am staying alive for my cats and the guy I love but he can easily just move on and find someone better, maybe even closer to him without all this bs that I have to endure. This situation in my country makes me so sad and depressed, I am putting on a brave face but I am crushed inside.. I feel like I am trapped truly trapped and there is no way out but to endure more and more. The days seems more and more bleak, we have food shortages, pet food shortages and soon maybe internet cut off as with water. I am devastated. I do not know anymore",1
"After getting ""fake"" heartbroken today over a ""obsessive fantasy"" I had with a guy and learning he has a girlfriend, I realised that all my previous trying has led to nothing but misery. I go to work and do a degree but for what? I still live with an abusive parent, have c-ptsd, am not even interested in any material goods. I wanted to get a degree so I can have my own family one day but that dream is also gone, I am too mentally fucked for thatI'm going to let my body go on autopilot aka continue to go to work so nobody gets suspicious but that is it. In my free time I will just cry and rot in bed like I already do. I am 25 years old and things always end in pain and sadness for me no matter what. That 30 seconds of happiness is not worth 30 days of pain so I decide to stop trying. Letting my body go on autopilot and continue dying inside",0
"Hi everyone. 28/F here.I got diagnosed with dysthymia about 6 weeks ago. I was given the choice of meds or psychotherapy to start off, and I chose psychotherapy because sertraline and trintrellix did not make much of a difference years prior. My question is, does anyone here want to share their experience of what psychotherapy is/has done for them?I have just had one session so far, but feel like I do not really understand what its about/what the goal is.I actually just left the session feeling sad and cried. The psychotherapist said she could not really identify any reason from my childhood or adolescence which would leave me with this condition. Which made me feel bad for venting about my family, and for not having a reason to be suffering from dysthymia. Diagnosed with dysthymia, psychotherapy?",0
"I have been thinking tonight and i think i had anxiety for more than i can think of. in first 2 years of uni and last year of high school i had a friend whom was anxious and he kind of gave his vibe to me, i panic a lot over small stuff. still it was worse when he was around and since i have not seen him i feel better but, maybe he induces my anxiety, other than that my mom does the same since she probably has anxiety issues but also depressed and taking depression pills. i do not know, i remember in first grade i sat down alone and just felt alone and dissatisfied, this feeling of dissatisfaction still continues till today. i had that feeling of loneliness maybe till 5th grade and then anxiety replaced it? i always feel i cannot trust people, nor they can trust me and i feel worthless. maybe its a relationship issue? i remember in kindergarten there was a girl that we liked each other but after that i moved out of that city.i feel lack of self-esteem and motivation, for last 4 years or so i have not done anything really, i guess i was more active in 7th grade(13yo) but it gradually went down till 12th where this guy came up and started his nihilistic crap and laziness and it felt like a hit on a nail and i failed 2 studies that year, me whom was acing before.was it puberty that messed me up? I am 22 now but i never had any relationship in my life, i was straight till 18, then anted to make my options more so i did not really care about gender till 20 but then again i feel i cannot get that emotional attachment to a same sex person. speaking of emotions i think i have emotional pain, sometimes my body, my chest and wrists hurt alot and i cry in my bed, i think i have this since when i was 13.i do not have much hope on stuff, things feel a bit numb, my studies are not going well and in last 2 semesters (thanks to covid) i have not seen many people and i did not study anything, but there were some friends around and we cheated the exams, which i personally have issue with. first semester i dropped a class because the guy gave points to everyone but i wanted to learn the topic so i dropped but now i just feel indifferent, i want to do stuff but i feel i cannot, i feel weak and not in control of my life, i feel i cannot stand for myself and get to anything that i ever want and if i want to do it, something will eventually go wrong and make me to lose. i feel failure is always there and its not a bad thing that happens and makes me sad, its just a part of everything i have or dream of, i guess i cannot achieve anything. i wanted to lose my weight for so long but anxiety made it just worse. i have lost much time that i cannot spend to experience and find stuff that i want i guess, or get skillfulled in two or three skills that i really want and i should just pass on. i failed my uni entrance exam in order to go to a good uni and went to a more normal one which i did not like, and i wanted to change it 3 times and the idea never left me and i still have nightmares about it, i tried to face and do it again but was just looking at an escape because it all was painful and was hurting me even more and someone told me to drop it, so i did stop taking re-entrance exam.i do not know what is wrong with me, i went to therapist 2 times but i could really speak since i just do not know.since this is too long i guess no one will even comment on this, huh i would not be amazed what is wrong with me?",0
"I think I had mentioned previously that, I was married. I have been married to a wonderful woman for nearly 37 years and, our love life WAS amazing. Key word WAS. She is never interested in the physical part anymore. She says she has vaginal issues and, I have absolutely no reason to disbelieve her. We tease each other now and then but, the act never happens. I take ""Men's Romance"" supplements and they help to a certain extent but, only for me to be able to masturbate to internet porn. That usually handles one need but, it is not the same as the act. It is a very wonderful thing to lay naked and, in the arms of someone you love. Especially after a mind blowing orgasm. We have not made love in a VERY long time and, I miss that. Even once in awhile would be nice. But, it never happens. I want her to want me to make love! She says she still finds me attractive but, it never happens. Always a reason. I do not doubt that, her reasons are legitimate and God knows, she is not cheating. I miss that intimacy. I need that intimacy. I have to have that intimacy!! I do not cheat, I cannot. That is not me. But, my fantasies are off the chart and, they are mostly about her!! But, I know it does not matter because, it is not going to happen. Hence the depression. Not a NEW reason per say but, a reason nevertheless. I am tired of jerking off. But, I would sooner swallow Drain cleaner than go looking elsewhere for the physical part. So, here I sit. Sucking it up and, moving onto the next depression. SIGH! Hope all is well for you all. Love and, hugs. Another Day, another new reason to be depressed.",0
"I was in a long distance with my then girlfriend for almost 4 years (we would meet during term breaks) and as the world knows covid lock down started at around march 2020. Due to borders closing and my studies (international university student) i was not able to travel. At first i was able to keep the relationship going but everything changed the start of this year.Communication was at an all time low. When i knew that i could not meet her for another year, I began to feel empty and questioned whether i truly loved my then gf. So much so that i developed depression. I lost all interest in my hobbies. I had insomnia and lack of appetite. I also inflicted self harm to which i knew was alarming. With that i sought help from my friends which i have trouble opening up to. One of the friend that was able to help was female (girl 2) to which i could open up to.The problem started when I developed a crush on her. At that point it was completely platonic. But when my then girlfriend confronted me about girl 2 i was forced to make a decision: to go with her or girl 2 (it was my choice ultimately but she wanted an immediate answer). The worst thing was that it was a stressful period due to my submissions. Along with heated arguments and rash decisions, i broke up with my then gf.It has been 3 months since the break up. Although girl 2 is helping me get better at handling the depression. I began to analyze what i could have done. I hate myself for not being strong enough mentally to continue the relationship. For not appreciating the things that i had. For not being proactive in communicating with her. Most of all for causing the love of my life pain. I felt like an asshole.I do not know if i can ever overcome the horrible choice of throwing away a perfect relationship. I understand the post cannot help me in anyway and i am the only one that can change my life around. i just wanted to be heard and maybe get some words of encouragement or different perspectives. Thanks for reading. Bad choices",0
"Its not about me, I do not feel at all suicidal but please try and help me. Works stressing their mother out, she has 12h shifts with only 1 and a half hour long breaks and she cannot get another job because of covid, its getting to her too much and she told my friend ""I cannot take it anymore"". What can I do to help both my friend and her mother? My friend is terrified and does not want to tell anyone else incase she is wrong and make things worse for her mother. What can I do to help, what advice can I give, what help can I send? My friends thinks her mother is suicidal and I do not know what to do.",1
"I am watching a crime show that is ""real life"" and there is this 18 year old girl who is so happy and inspiring.Why cannot I be like her?I want to learn how to be like that.

I guess our brains are just different.I feel like a burden when I am like this. I want to be not a burden around others by being happy which would make them feel happy to be around me.I hope this post made sense to someone. I want to be a more positive person. You know, those people who are still happy in the face of adversity?",0
This month has just had it in for me the entire time. I cannot catch a break this month. I have not felt this bad for long period of time for a minute. Today has been the worst. I felt like self harming but I did not. Last time was in March. I also found out my late mom had hepatitis C and I connected the dots and things make sense. I still love her and respect her but its a bit of a shock to me. I knew her as having a problem with alcohol but never thought she would have messed around with drugs. I do not think she was a drug addict but I know she had to have had some here and there. Idk my brain feels dead. I feel detached from stuff. I was at work today and for a few minutes it felt like I was not actually there. It was weird. :( ?,0
"There supposedly was a time (or maybe just a fantasy) when life was semi enjoyable, when happiness was easily achieved. It seems so far back it may as well be myth. In current times there is been a near-to constant battle with wishes to commit suicide. They became so intense that we made the unfair decision to give one part the responsibility of holding those feelings for the rest of us, because we knew together we would be unable to keep from going through with it. Since then we all have gone through life, each getting our own various interests and having superficial friends, but the one in charge of the frustration at how meaningful other people's lives have become with time while ours remains empty has continually made sure noone has been able to get close to us. They know that deep relationships act like shackles, trapping us in this shtsack world out of concern for the effect our suicide would have on them. it is been a game of chess, wanting freedom from the pain of life but also avoiding what it would take to gain it; wanting to have meaning to life but avoiding the things that might give it. Life is a bunch of worthless distractions from becoming free",1
"I have not had one day in the past year and a half where I have not thought of killing myself. I have cried until the sun rose, slashed my arms, hit myself. All of it. I am a guy that just recently graduated high school as our valedictorian, why should I be allowed to cry? I have tried getting help, prayed, everything. I wanted to be a trauma surgeon and travel with the Red Cross to the Middle East as a volunteer surgeon.But tonight was the last straw for me. there is no one for me to go to. No help. I was raped by my ex girlfriend last year, but who would help be there to help me? I am just a guy after all. I wanted to do my part and help as many people as I could. But I cannot anymore. The road is so long and lonely. I have no doubt I would have made it, but there is no hope or point to it anymore.I have decided to hang myself tomorrow night. All set and stone. I cannot keep hurting like this any longer. I am so scared, but alarmingly calm at the same time. I worry about what will become of my mom, but I know she will be taken care of.I have read so many posts from this group for a long time now. It breaks my heart seeing so much sadness, and knowing I cannot comment encouraging words on every post. I hope you all find a form of long lasting joy. I love you guys. 365+ days of thinking of suicide.",1
"So after i stopped following with my therapist because i discovered he had no experience treating depressed people, he hid the fact that he is specialized in couples therapy from me, a psychology intern, who volunteered to help me, dumped me because apparently my condition is too complicated for her. it is been two years on anti-depressants, anxiety meds, anti-psychotic meds and anti-epileptic meds, been 5 months into a psychiatric ward. And guess what? Not a single improvement lol. Everyone just spout the ""your life worths living"" crap, then quits soon after they discovered how many traumas i bear, fucking greedy world, depriving me from joy and making me feel less than human, not a single friend, never felt what it is like to be relevant in someone is life, only a piece of garbage to be used then walked on, even my own family, except mom who still care about me, despises me and wishes i was not born, including my dumb fatherI wish i can undo my birth, i do not have a single happy memory to help me cope Back to square one",0
"I am not trying to make some edgy post about how I want to do drugs and shit but I do not think its something you can say without coming across like that so whatever. But I do not know, I just want to do heroin really badly right now. I guess I am just sick of feeling so shitty and I am sick of nothing working to make it better. All the medications I have been on have done sweet fuck all and I have been through dozens at this point. Therapy has not helped me at all and I just feel awful all the time. I feel like I do not belong in the world at all and yet I am forced to exist in it. So I keep cycling between two thoughts constantly, that I want to kill myself or that I want to do heroin. I do not know why, but I really, REALLY want to try heroin",0

"I am honestly fucking struggling. I have some bearable days where my overthinking is not obsessive, but I just do not know what to do anymore. I am on 5mg of Zyprexa, 80mg of Prozac 20mg of Propranolol daily and recently started 10mg of Buspirone 2x a day. Also 1mg of Klonopin &amp; 20mg of Adderall as needed. I have been hospitalized 3 times. (Inpatient psych) first for psychosis, had been severely stressed out and not sleeping due to an overwhelming job position, so I was paranoid amongst other things. This first experience was less than traumatic than my last, well get to that part eventually because I clearly have a lot to unpack. I spent about two weeks inpatient at a nice college unit where I rested and recovered from my one time episode. I went home and was very depressed and suicidal considering they had just taken me off of the Effexor I was on for a few months. I was paranoid and worried that my ex was out to get me and for some reason related a TV series to my own personal life, and brought up some trauma that I previously did not unpack but made the mistake of doing it in an unsafe judgemental space. I broke up with him because I could not stand my feelings and I still fucking miss him to this day I went back in on the 31st of October of 2018. I felt unsafe and had my dad take me to the hospital. There I was at the same college inpatient unit for another 3 weeks where I had made some friends and started feeling ok. After that I went to a partial hospital program which was 5x a week morning to noon for a good 6 weeks. During that time I tried Zoloft which did not do shit apparently, then moved on to Prozac and Wellbutrin, was briefly on Risperidone my first hospitalization which made me lactate causing me to freak out which I clearly did not need at the time. After my second hospitalization I tried Abilify, went to the partial hospital program again, found a new therapist so on and so fourth. My third hospitalization started June 2020, I was tazed in my bathtub where I had went to hide when 4 police cars showed up because my father could not contain me. I had not slept in 3 days and was paranoid, handcuffed and held down by 3 police officers, and had my legs shackled. They sedated me when I got to the hospital and all I remember is trying to stretch my legs and being unable to because of the foot cuffs. I felt helpless and humiliated, I had no pants on and my entire building was outside when this was happening. Some asshole neighbor of mine even took a video of the whole fucking fiasco but denies it to this day. I still have a lot of trauma to unpack and have struggled with finding a therapist. I have had a few and i just do not get shit through my thick head. I am fucking blabbering but I am desperate and leaving to my parents country tomorrow to get clean off weed because all I do is smoke to escape my feelings. I am suicidal as fuck and live for the life and love of my parents and sister. I am desperate for any insight thought or anything. I am losing my shit dude I sound insane but I do not ducking care 22F MDD&amp;GAD Hopeless.",0

WHY JUST WHY i just want to die in my sleep, i am done trying again and again AND I COME BACK TO THE SAME POINT WHERE I STARTED EVERY.FUCKING.TIME. no srsly tell me what is the point",1
"I am very sick and tired, both mentally and physically. I have been struggling with a lot of physical health issues for my whole life, and I have been struggling with mental health issues for the past 6-7 years, I am so tired of having to deal with both problems, as my physical health makes my mental health worse and the stress from my mental health is likely just making my conditions worse, its a never ending cycle and I rarely feel good, ever. I have been struggling with severe asthma for my whole life, which is fine on its own, but its at the point where I have a hard time doing much exercise, and I can no longer cope with weather changes, so every time it rains a lot of it becomes a bit more dry than normal I find myself heaving for air and coughing up blood. I am writing this right after contemplating taking my own life and coughing up more blood into my sink. My asthma is not all, I have a lot of trouble eating food, I randomly get very sick after eating and I cannot seem to link it to any specific type of food, so almost every day after eating a meal I am in pain for hours. I have a hard time sleeping, I have barely gotten any sleep the last few months, and when I do sleep I sleep almost the whole day, and I cannot get out of bed to do anything, its very frustrating. As for my mental health, I have not been able to seek any professional health for a lot of reasons, so whatever I say about my mental health is not diagnosed, but all I know is that I NEED to see a professional soon, I cannot handle my own thoughts anymore and it sucks. I have been struggling with really severe depression since I was about 11-ish, and the earliest suicide attempt I can remember was over the summer after I had completed 6th grade, I had not been eating for a few days and I was just extremely sad. I have had a few attempts before, usually I am too tired or scared to fully go through with it, which sometimes when I am having a good day I feel grateful for not going through with, but usually I just remember my past attempts and feel an overwhelming urge to try again. I also have really extreme anxiety, and it is exhausting. My anxiety is just crippling me and it kind of rules my life to a large degree, as I do not ever get close to many people, and I am too scared to just act how I want to act around peers and even friends. Speaking of, I do not ever speak to any of my friends outside of when I am physically around them, and I never see them on my own time simply because I have no energy to see anyone and I do not live near most of my friends, which is sad since I only have like a handful of people I would call friends, and I am not close to them by any means beyond friendly engagements. My experience with schooling also makes me extremely depressed constantly. When I was in middle school a few years back I was constantly bullied for a lot of things: my poor social skills, being nerdy and kind of awkward, being annoying, and acting ""like a fag"" (this particularly hurts now because I am gay). I would get my books thrown at me, people punched me and once there was a boy about twice my size who made remarks that he was going to rape and beat me up in the school bathroom, and then followed me around the school with his friends. I tried to do sports, I played football (my dad wanted me to try it out, I never liked sports at all anyways) and this made my have a mental breakdown every day we had a game, and when it was not game day, people would bully me in the locker room. The boy that threatened to hurt me in the school bathroom got paired with me to practice tackle drills, and instead of doing it how we were instructed, he would pick me up and slam me into the ground repeatedly, which was not how our coach told us to do it, and it hurt my back and made me shake and cry after practice. In high school, I joined the swim team, as I loved swimming and I was actually very good at it, and on top of that it was the only sport I was able to do without worsening my asthma, which was great. But the massive pressure I had on me to do well in an extremely competitive swim team made me constantly anxious, and I cannot even enjoy going to the pool anymore. I got picked on by my swim mates as well, because I was not very well socially adjusted, and I would get insulted in the locker room for being a little weird. Our soon to become team captain was kind to me and told me not to listen to them after school, but that really did not help much. My family is not really much better: my dad is never home so I do not even know him as much as I wish I could. My biological dad is somewhere in Europe, and he stopped even trying to talk to me anymore when I was 10 years old. My adopted dad is alright, but he is kind of cold and does not really show affection in a way that I understand, although I know he cares for me. My mom had a bad childhood, so she has a lot of problems that I have to step around constantly. I ask them to take me to a professional of some sort, and up until a few months ago they would just play down my mental issues and coupled with my really bad anxiety I was too anxious to actually say anything. I started telling them I had very frequent suicidal thoughts, and this I think really scared both my mom and dad and so they kind of lashed out, I do not think they know what to do. My dad told me that killing myself would be a selfish thing and I just told him to fuck off if that is what he wants to tell me, and my mom told me she would get me help but always is too busy/forgets to schedule me an appointment. I feel like I am trapped in a box and I am invisible to my own family most of the time. A few years ago I started having obtrusive thoughts that ranged from random urges to harm myself, many of which I acted on, to thoughts that my family secretly hates me. This past year was awful for me. I am an at risk group for Covid and the whole pandemic thing just took a massive toll on my already declining mental health. Being in my house was not bad for me thankfully, I am kind of used to being alone, but the frankly idiotic and terrible response to it by my local and national government made me a lot more nihilistic than I already was. I had a heavy school workload, I have always been considered ""gifted"" so most of my classes are pretty intensive and doing them online was terrible. I sacrificed my sleep for A's and B's and my dad still was not satisfied, which made our relationship even worse as I was so tired I just told him to shut up. My parents argue a lot as well, sometimes my dad yells at me for no reason and my mom yells at my dad, and it is almost constant. I have also lost faith in my parents being competent role caretakers in any way. They argue like children, and its almost always over me as well. I already lost one dad and I do not want to lose another, I wish I could fucking die in an accident so my family could stop having to argue, or pay for my medical treatment. I have little to no energy to do anything that could take my mind off of my problems either, I just lay in bed all day and zone out while watching YT videos that I do not really want to watch anyways. I am also worried my teachers think I am ""special"" or something, I cannot really engage in social situations that well and I think I might have autism, as some of my relatives have it and it would kind of explain my lack of social function. But my parents will not take me to see anyone anyways, so why should I even care? Sometimes I wonder if I am being neglected by family, I would consult my counselor but my anxiety stops me from really speaking to anyone about it because I am scared it will turn out my parents are abusing me mentally and I do not think they are bad people, they just have a lot of their own issues and they are frankly just silly people in their own right. I do not know what to do, I am kind of hoping that my health issues will just kill me already, I do not think I am going to get any better, my asthma is only getting worse to the point that my doctors are assessing if my lungs even work properly at all, and I also might need to get the inside of my stomach looked at because my doctors could not find out why my body freaks out whenever I eat, which scares me. I do not know if I am going to live a long life, and all I want is to have my problems go away. I hate where I live as well, I cannot stand it at all, and I cannot move currently due to a multitude of reasons. I want to just die already because living this way for almost a decade now has just destroyed me as a person, I feel sick inside and I have no one to really talk to about it, I have some online friends who are very kind to me, but I get panic attacks and I feel extremely ill whenever I open up about my issues to someone I know. I do not know what to do, I keep remembering instances where I attempted suicide and its overwhelming me all the time. I cannot even use sleep as an escape. I hate my life. I am sick and tired",1
"I have made a video. It is the last one on my phone. I do not know what I am going to do. I keep picking up knives and putting them down. It just hurts too much. I do not have any kind of medicine here I can take too much of and I am afraid of hanging myself. I just need to die but I do not know how. I have two daughters (not home at the moment I would never let them see meLike this) I want everyone to know I tried really hard. I cleaned up my life and I did all the things that were supposed to make us all happy for years but I cannot forget my past, I was assaulted at 13 and it hurts to watch these guys live their lives happy while I feel disgustingand I cannot go on. I was called fat, a waste of life and a junkie by the people who were supposed to love me most. I feel stuck in this thick mud and I cannot breathe. It hurts so bad and I am too old to still be hurting from these past traumas. I just want this here so it can maybe be located one day, the decision is not easy, I do not know if I can do it or my kids will be home soon I will not have them find me so maybe a hotel tomorrow night, but I cannot go on. I will not put my name I do not want to be stopped. But when they go through my phone they will see this. Please nobody be like me, get help, I did not and its just too late for me. I love you my daughters, I love you so much and everyday I held on was for you. Note to them.",1
I hate looking in the mirror so much. I do not really know why. I do not exactly like how I look but I do not think I am ugly either. But every time I look in the mirror everything is so off. I do not like what I see. It just feels wrong. it is gotten to the point where I actively close my eyes or look away from mirrors. I literally turn the lights off when I have to brush my teeth and stuff. I hate looking in the mirror,0

"I have been plagued by suicidal ideation for a long time. My father committed suicide when I was in high school, so I have been adamant about dismissing those thoughts, knowing firsthand how it affects survivors. it is been getting a lot worse the past year, though, and I am really starting to struggle and become concerned. This is despite the fact I am under the regular care of a psychiatrist and compliant with my medications. I am apparently a ""unicorn"" - a prolific non-responder. I have also had poor results with other approaches such as journaling, meditation, gratitude therapy, yoga, etc.I recognize that I have loving, supportive friends and family, but besides worrying about who will take care of my cat, the only thing keeping me going right now is the idea that those people would grieve...which is becoming less and less of a deterrent. I do not *want* to follow in my father's footsteps, but it is feeling more and more inevitable.I honestly cannot think how my life is valuable, which is scary. I cannot identify any particular talents, passions, or ambitions to work toward, and do not know what I can offer the world or leave as a legacy.Can anyone offer tips or experiences that helped you find value in your life? I am grasping at straws, so any input would be greatly appreciated.Thank you so much for taking the time to read my ramble and consider helping! Struggling to find value in my life",1

"Hi, I am Chris and I am 21. I live in Italy and I am new around here. I decided to join because... everything went downhill on these days. I am not sleeping or eating, I am working 24/7 and my body is collapsing slowly. But I could not care less. I need to find some help because I do not think I can resist for long. So, i know this girl since 2015 ish and we fell in love with each other really fast. I am the kind of guy that have that really old mentality where I can only love once. I can still have relationships but I never really loved someone that much. She quickly became my everything and I could not live without her. long story short, I did everything to make her happy and I worked hard for a future together. I promised to myself that this girl, will be the woman that will raise our children with me. I decided that she must be the only girl of my life, no matter what. and then Covid happened. we could not see each other for 6 months because she is nearby my general location but was in another region. So we had to restart after all of this time lost but we had a lot of fights instead and things were not going that well. Then, the worse happened. she was not sure about our relationship because we could not see each other for a lot of time but she told me to remain calm since she still had feeling for me so we will be together again soon. but I am not done yet. while we were in a pause, she met a guy. she was honest with me, I do not hate her. but the sentence changed. we will not be again together. if only we resisted like till her birthday ( a week later ) that me and her family decided to surprise her... we could have been together for like two weeks at least. but no. now she invited that guy, and her family is really sad and worried about me since they became mine family too. and now I am all alone. I still love her so much, I constantly cry about it and I am starting to let my life go. I cannot do a thing bc everything reminds me of her, we did so much together. idk, I do not want to move forward, I just cannot without her. and it is killing me the fact that another guy, even if a friend still, can be with her. but soon they will be together if things go well and I do not want to ever see that day. I am looking for help because a part of me thinks that life matter, the other half just wants to die. idk even know, I am so confused, I cannot explain how depressed I feel, I think about suicide too, I want to stop suffering. thanks a lot for your time, it means a lot to me, I hope the best for each one of you.. it is unbelievable how a single girl could change my life... for ever. plot twist: in a really bad way...",0
"Who knows who was the first person who thought giving another some piece of paper in exchange for something else was a good idea. What value did they see in that?These papers and coins known as ""money"" changed completely the way the world works. If you have it, you can cover some or all of your basic needs. But if you have none at all, you either live miserably or die.You want a place to stay? Pay.You want clothing? Pay.Feel hungry, thirsty, sick? Pay.People say money is something you get as a reward for your efforts. But seems like it is the only reward that matters.Doctors do not save people because they care for their patients. it is because they are getting paid. The satisfaction of seeing their patients healthy and happy is not enough.If youtubers did not get paid for making videos, half of them would not even be recognised.Singers do not sing because seeing their fans enjoying their music brings them happiness or satisfaction.Cooks make food to get paid, and with that pay they buy their own food, and the money they spent is later given to someone else, then someone more, and it is a never ending cycle.Very few do stuff because they actually like what they do, or because they want to because a positive impact on others, and they do not expect anything in exchange.But no one can really live like this because it is simply how the world turned out to be. You need money to live whether you like it or not. Which is one of the reasons why some people are forced to do some of the most horrible things in order to get it.Why could not everyone have the same opportunities? Why is money the only reward you can get for your efforts? Since when did money matter more than yours or others' happiness? Basically, your life depends on these pieces of paper called ""money""",0

I felt the weight of these years again today. I have been in a rough for the past months after my birthday(may). I do not see a future for me outside of a casket. I feel like I am living in narrowed time. Like every second is a gift I am wasting. Its affecting my sleep now. I do not remember feeling well rested in too long. My friends say I should seal therapy but I barely make enough to eat. I wonder if this is what it feels like for you all. I am a passenger in this body these movements are mine but entirely foreign . The decisions I make are not mine not entirely I feel like its just what I am supposed to do. I put up appearances and let people believe I am doing okay.

"I hate it when a person finally has the courage to open up about how their feeling and someone will say ""remember someone always has it worse than you"", making them feel that their issues are invalid so they burry it back in the dark corner of their brain instead of talking about it.

So I continued cutting, and it was not until almost a year later I regained the confidence to talk to someone else who helped me greatly. So if you use the phrase, even though your intentions are to do good. Please stop. The phrase ""someone always has it worse than you"" annoys me so much.",0

They are extremely individualistic. My parents keep surveillance all the time. I feel like I am living in an mental institution I can do anything without my parents knowing. They take turns leaving the house so I am not alone. I cannot rely on my friends all the time. Literally just work and go home. I feel so disconnected from the world like my life is not real.

So I have been struggling with depression for some time. Last year it hit a head when I actually attempted suicide. The problem is that one of my hobbies was rifle shooting. I even had a custom made $1000 rifle I assembled myself. I am a rather skilled marksman (markswoman?) but obviously having guns around is dangerous for me. I ended up selling my guns to a friend. Now my question is a similar but safer hobby I might be able to take up. I am thinking of getting back into archery but I wanted to make this post to see if anyone else had other ideas for a safe hobby like rifle shooting. Want to keep my hobby.,0

"I graduated college a few years ago, but it was the worst time of my life. Became depressed first day because of growing up, leaving all my friends, and taking harder courses (because I was in Special Ed since elementary). My therapist involuntarily sent me to the hospital for a few days (I could never trust anyone, not even myself, again, thanks to her). Had to change majors and take an extra year because I kept failing classes. Graduated but I have to pay off student loans, but I do not have a full time job. Used to work 3 part time jobs, but due to the pandemic, I am only left with 1. I feel like I ruined my own life by going to college, wasting my parents money, taking courses I did not want to take (like Italian, I wanted to learn Japanese); all to make them happy. I feel like I failed them and myself. I could have gone to a technical school or learned a trade or even gone to community college with all my friends, but I chose the traditional university route like my sister, except she has a Phd and a good paying job (director of a childrens museum) meanwhile I cannot even get unemployment and living in my moms.

"this is my first reddit post ever. I am wondering is this suicidal ideation the normal one I have always had, just with some of the emotion and anxiety lifted because of the meds? or is it additional from the meds? before the meds I have thought a lot about it and known already that it would be more preferable to not live in this horrid world than it would be. I am 36 so have had time to think and learn about the state of things. I am not the type to do the typical life with kids house all that stuff. I am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then I think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies,..and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a SHIT. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, I do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact I think it is normal *not* to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the SSRI (generic lexapro) I already knew and felt this, but was SO overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult ADHD life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the SSRI (in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd ), which I was resisting for a long time. always been anti-meds but LITERALLY could not STAND carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my ""natural healing"" beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the SSRI, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. I am very clear and calm about it now. I am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once I get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, I can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. I am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, I am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while I love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason I *would not* voluntarily leave this earth... each of us can only suffer for so long right? am I supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because I do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached I become and drawn towards this plan. and I am not irrational, it is not like I would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like I am planning a vacation or a trip, I feel the same way, that same eagerness or like I have this thing in the distance that I can look forward to. I have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!SO... is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because I have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to WANT to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know I can talk to my or a therapist but I also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the SSRI is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent SSRI, should I be alarmed?",0

"Hey r/depression. Back to vent here once again. I went through a stretch where I have been doing better at handling my emotions via a few methods like taking a quick second to think of 5 things I can see, 4 I can hear, etc. (its crazy how much that is helped me in day to day life), but I have recently fallen back into patterns of negative thinking that are becoming increasingly debilitating. Whenever I am talking in a large group of people, a good example of this kind of situation would be eating dinner with coworkers, friends, etc., I find myself fading. I think the proper term for this phenomenon I am trying to describe is depersonalization, but I find that fading describes the feeling much more accurately. Ill be talking with someone one second and the next its like I have become more focused on my thoughts than the conversation and thus stop processing the words I am hearing, like I am just zoning out. Big deal right? Everyone does that. The strange part is that I am not even thinking when I fade, I just feel numb. The words I hear start sounding like a foreign language and I have existential feeling as if I am playing a game and the person in front of me does not actually exist. Everything just turns to shapes and noise. Like the world around me is literally blurring and fading away in front of me. Its hard to describe, but there is almost a feeling of fear that washes over me when I fade. Its scary to feel and recognize yourself slipping away. Eventually I just come back and ask the person I am with what they just said to me, but its very jarring whenever this randomly happens. (I say random, but these fading events are usually preceded by negative thoughts) It all just feels fuzzy.",0

My intrusive thoughts have been especially bad, and I have found myself quite literally staring off thinking about death to spite people, how my family would recover, and even writing a note in my head. I feel so guilty for the few that genuinely care about me, but it almost feels like the best revenge I could get on others. I do not like to hurt people often, which is how I can tell I am on the edge. I am scared. The anxiety makes me scared, but at the same time the depression makes me not care?",0
Should I die to go meet them in heaven? I do not know and I cry almost everyday its just me and my brothers and sisters please give me advice My mom died a few months ago and my dad is on life support.,0
"I (19M) have been struggling with myself for a while now. I do not even feel like a real person and I do not even have friends my own age to hang out with not even one. I always have to sit at the house 24/7 overthinking and being near my annoying siblings who do nothing but piss me off 24/7. Everyday of my life I always overthink to the point where I feel like my brain has a malfunction. I do not have an ID, driver license, or job yet. I would wish I had at least one person irl to hang out with my age. Also a lot of the time I always dream about being in a relationship with a girl. I am starting to feel like life is not real. Most of the time I do not even feel like a real person",0
"Have been lurking around for quite sometime on this sub now. Never wanted to make a post but here it is anyway because I really want to vent it out without being known.Thought I would make a throwaway account but had no motivation to do so. it is so very difficult. Endless rows of days. If not for my mom, I would have been long gone. She, literally, is the only reason why I am still around. And she has not been doing great, health wise. I am a sore loser. Got no friends or people I could talk to or expect any emotional support. it is all my fault that things are like that though, besides people are busy with their own life.Tried journaling. It did not work. At. All. When I revisited what I wrote it only justified my thoughts. The thing is I do not want to hurt my mom. we are not exactly a functional family but my parents love me in the way they can. that is more than I could ask for, I guess. Anxiety and being gullible in general made me quit my decent and we will paying job 2.5 years ago. have not been able to get back because I have panic attacks in the interviews. My dad hates me now because I am a loser. I have absolutely nothing to look forward to. I hate facing another day and the day after that....day after day after day....I just do not want to do it anymore. I hate how I like the idea of not existing anymore.",1
A friend with depression talks to everyone except me out of a sudden. Does anyone know why ? Need advice,0
"they are so fucked up and weird. Am I the only one? Like they are not even nightmares necessarily, although they sometimes are that. Idk if you guys have ever had fever dreams but they feel literally exactly the same. They just feel really weird and bad, idk how to describe it. Like literally last night whenever I would fall asleep I would go into this lucid dream where I kept on floating away up into the sky like a balloon and I had to keep grabbing on to things to keep myself grounded and to stop from floating away, lmao. And I knew was dreaming and would try to keep waking myself up but end up falling back asleep again and again, it went on for hours, throughout the night. Can anyone else relate? Ssri withdrawal dreams",0
"Hi everyone, I am prone to depression (hey, that is the name of the subreddit) but when I am not in a depressive episode I am a huge overachiever. I am 24F and work in a creative, high-powered job with a lot of older, mostly male, people.Back when I was in college I would just ""power through"" depressive episodes by focusing on graduating. I developed a lot of tricks to force myself to endure temporary pain to maximize my grades. This was not a particularly sustainable solution, but it did work, and I graduated with honors. I recently joined a new team at work and it is very demanding of me in ways I am not used to, there is a lot of politics that I am struggling with, and very open-ended projects. Still, I managed to find a way to be productive. For the first few months I was basically a model employee, working tons of extra hours to deliver great work. But something snapped about a month ago and I have been in a real funk, and it is been getting worse. I just feel like nothing matters, like I am bad at everything, like I cannot deliver, like I am letting everyone down, like I am broken. I probably have not gotten in a good day of work in almost 3 weeks. This used to happen to me in college but my usual forcing functions (strict due date, must get good grades, must graduate) do not apply anymore. My boss has not noticed anything because I am pretty autonomous usually, but I would imagine that I will have to talk to him soon.I have an appointment set up with a therapist soon (have not been to therapy in around a year) but I am getting really concerned about how this episode is going to affect me longer term. When I am feeling good I get myself into these overachiever scenarios where depressed me cannot possibly measure up, then when I get sluggish I feel so inadequate that I just beat myself up the whole time. it is gotten to the point where I am considering talking to a psychiatrist and taking disability leave rather than work another day where I just stare blankly at my computer and stress out.Can anyone relate? Advice? Making it through a depressive episode as an overachiever with a demanding job?",0
I have reached a strange point where I cannot get over her. I have reached a point where I am literally begging to die. Just defeated,1
"Its just weird. I cannot seem to end my life for nothing and you have people offing theirselves because someone left them or something embarrassing. Forgive me if i come off as downplaying other feelings its just...what have to happen to me in order for it to end all. I have no body. Nobody likes me. Every day I am humiliated and insulted whether i hear it or not. I am the worst, most sickest kind of person in the world mentally. Why must i keep being tortured by living when i want to go? It bothers me so much. I sleep outside but i wonder how people who is going through less can successfully end it all and i cannot no matter what I do. I guess I am too broke to even end it.",1
"you cannot see the floor. i have almost all of our households dishes in there, so much rotting food and trash and piles of shit. my beds covered with shit too, i literally cannot do anything but kind of use my computer in there. I have all but moved downstairsi do not qant advice for cleaning it because none of it will work, its nothing i have not tried before, no pick up 1 or 2 things everday, or any of that bullshit. if it worked for you kudos and I am genuinely happy for you but I am just..incompatible with that. it really sucks. i miss having a room, i just cannot do anuthing my room is unlivable",0
